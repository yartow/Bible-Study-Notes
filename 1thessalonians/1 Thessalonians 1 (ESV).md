# 1 Thessalonians 1 (ESV) 
***Greeting***
*1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy,*
*To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:*
*Grace to you and peace.*

***The Thessalonians' Faith and Example***
*2 We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly mentioning you in our prayers, 3 remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. 4 For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has ::chosen:: you, 5 because our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction. You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake.*

Of course the **gospel** referred to here is the Gospel brought forth by Jesus through His living example, but it is the words concerning this gospel that we say to the world.
Now there are times at which you feel, through the Holy Spirit, that the gospel you've brought to someone has a different effect, it could land better or be received better, or you've noticed that the words you've said were truly inspired by the Holy Spirit and were not your own. That is why in verse 5 Paul is so convicted that God has **chosen** the Thessalonians referred to in this letter. #biblestudy/theology/predestination/election They **know** this for certain because of three things: (1) the gospel came **in power**, (2) it came **in the Holy Spirit**, and (3) it came **with full conviction**. 
They knew and *felt*—even though this word is not in the text, it cannot be otherwise than that Paul felt this power (of the Holy Spirit)—that the Gospel was received with power, just like a preacher after having preached his sermon feels and knows it was a good and powerful sermon. But also, he knows that he spoke in the Holy Spirit, for example because he does not feel pride, but humbled, and he knows that the words that came out of his mouth, whether they were written first on or were given on the spot, were not his, but were given through the Holy Spirit (during his preparation of the sermon). Lastly, the conviction Paul speaks of is their own, that is of **Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy**, not that of the Thessalonians. A preacher needs to be convicted of his own words and when preaching about sin, he needs to realize he is a sinner; when preaching on grace, he needs to know he is forgiven as well, and so on. 
In Paul's case each of those *criteria* were satisfied, and so we too, when preaching the Gospel, might be able to know when someone is **chosen** and has truly repented and become a true Bible-believing Christian **in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction**. 
These criteria are for those on the side of the message deliverers. Below Paul describes the criteria for the receivers of the good news. 

*6 And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you received the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit, 7 so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. 8 For not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that we need not say anything. 9 For they themselves report concerning us the kind of ::reception:: we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, 10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.*

The criteria Paul mentions here of the Thessalonians who received the good news are that they (1) **received the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit**, and that (2) their **faith in God has gone forth everywhere**, which is shown by the testimonies concerning the **reception** had with the Thessalonians. Here, again, *hospitality* is a sign of true conversion. See also notes on Acts 28:1.
The proof of all of this is not through the Thessalonians, but through others, which is the best promotion one can get. 
It is important to note that it joy is sign of true conversion, but especially when there is afflication. As MacArthur once said in a sermon #quotes/church 
> Light shines ever brighter in the darkness.
