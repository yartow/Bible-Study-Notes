# Proverbs 11
*The Lord detests dishonest scales, but accurate weights find favor with him.* 

Help me, Lord, for I know I am guilty of this charge. I treat people differently depending on how I feel or think about them. Though this may not always be about looks or status, I still have prejudices.

*When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom.* 

I know that in my moments of pride I have been disgraced by my own fault. I had created holes for myself to fall in and said things I did not mean or could not make true.
But in my humility, in realizing I was wrong, wisdom came and told me what to do.
God provides wisdom to those who realize they cannot succeed by their own wisdom.

*The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity.* 

I must admit I have duplicity - as mentioned before - in treating people, but also in my character. I am not always upright about my friendliness. It is this integrity of the upright that guides them, do what is right and of integrity.
But the unfaithful are not of integrity, they will not be guided in the wrong way, and eventually will be destroyed by their own duplicity.
Duplicity can only be maintained by lying, orally, to others and pretending, and lying internally to oneself. Eventually that person will not know anymore what he said or what he even believes himself is true or not.

*Wealth is worthless in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.* 

In the day of wrath, when our enemy attacks us, he does not care how much money we have. Rather yet, the more money we have, the more he wants to kill us. But our righteousness delivers us from death, not directly per se, as we might still die, but we will be brought to life by God.

*The righteousness of the blameless makes their paths straight, but the wicked are brought down by their own wickedness.* 

Once again we read that the wicked cause their own demise, and not only do the blameless survive, they will also have straight paths, which are easier to walk on.
In the beginning it is difficult to walk on the figurative straight path, but eventually it is easier, for you have got nothing to hide from the tax or police, you can sleep easily at night and have no lies to hide.

*The righteousness of the upright delivers them, but the unfaithful are trapped by evil desires.* 

The above was about life and death, this is about deliverance. In a sense being trapped in life comes to being dead in life. What use is life if you are trapped? Of what use is it when you live in prison?
In fact we were all trapped by evil desires, but it is only our righteousness that can deliver us from this trap. Focus ourselves not on what we desire, but on what the people and other beings in this world need.

*Hopes placed in mortals die with them; all the promise of their power comes to nothing.* 

Having hope in a president who changes the world for the good is futile, for a human being will die, and then it is up to the next one. Instead place your hope on someone Who lives forever, our Almighty God.

*The righteous person is rescued from trouble, and it falls on the wicked instead.* 

No matter whether it makes sense or not, always stay righteous. If you are in trouble and you think lying will get you out of it, you are making a mistake. Only by being righteous you will be rescued from trouble. Though it may not seem like it, eventually it is the case. The wicked instead will get the trouble, or most of it, though it may take a long time.

*With their mouths the godless destroy their neighbors, but through knowledge the righteous escape.* 

Do not speak bad about your neighbors or you may be seen as being godless. In a situation where you are caught up by bad things your neighbor has done, the righteous escape through knowledge. That is, by doing the right things God tells them to do.

*When the righteous prosper, the city rejoices; when the wicked perish, there are shouts of joy.*
The city itself knows who is righteous and who is wicked. No label needs to be placed. Though there is ambiguity about whether Trump is a good person or a good president, the protests can be heard while the shouts of joy are only a handful.
It is not the same situation as this verse describes though, because it puts the condition as “the wicked *perish* ”, so we could only know whether he is wicked, when Trump perishes. 

*Through the blessing of the upright a city is exalted, but by the mouth of the wicked it is destroyed.*
*Proverbs 11:1-11 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.11.1-11.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.11.1-11.NIV)* 

On the other hand, we can see through the results of the country if Trump becomes president, whether he is upright.

*12 Whoever derides their neighbor has no sense,*
*but the one who has understanding holds their tongue.* 

Lord, please keep me from speaking out my will and mind too fast. Let me hold my tongue in these moments you think it is wise to do so.
Let me not deride my neighbor.

*13 A gossip betrays a confidence,*
*but a trustworthy person keeps a secret.* 

Please let me not gossip, although the temptation is great to do so. Let me be and stay trustworthy of keeping secrets.

*14 For lack of guidance a nation falls,*
*but victory is won through many advisers.* 

If this is applicable to Ben Carson's support for Donald Trump, I might understand why Carson chose to support him, i.e. to advise Trump in the parts where Carson *does* has influence.
My question, though, is whether it is rightful to side with the enemy for the good of the nation. Perhaps he is not siding, but merely advising. If his public reputation becomes negative that might hurt his Christian reputation as well, and that is bad for God.

*15 Whoever puts up security for a stranger will surely suffer,*
*but whoever refuses to shake hands in pledge is safe.* 

My wife and I are glad that people have put up security for us. Fortunately, we were not strangers to these people.
It seems a little ungrateful to not help others instead when we have just been helped, but this proverb is wise in that helping out others with security, like a pledge or a ransom, is not meant for strangers.

*16 A kindhearted woman gains honor,*
*but ruthless men gain only wealth.* 

In the world ruthless men are looked up to, because of their wealth and because they dare to defy God. But to him is no honor and especially no honor from God. God favors a kindhearted woman, without any income, and gives her much more honor.

Etymologie ruthless

*17 Those who are kind benefit themselves,*
*but the cruel bring ruin on themselves.* 

This is so contrary to the world's ways, being kind to others benefits oneself. But being cruel (to others I think), will bring ruin upon oneself. So what you do to someone else, has great effect on the benefit for yourself.

*18 A wicked person earns deceptive wages,*
*but the one who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward.* 

Indeed, Father, it is as You say, a wage can be deceptive. A wage does not prove how much one is worth or how good he is at his job. It is unfortunate that I have experienced that personally, because now I see myself as — and know that I am — wicked. But it is better to know that than not to know.

*19 Truly the righteous attain life,*
*but whoever pursues evil finds death.* 

And in this sense I am attaining life, I have not obtained it yet, but I am pursuing it. At least I know I am in the right direction and that I am not pursuing evil.

*20 The Lord detests those whose hearts are perverse,*
*but he delights in those whose ways are blameless.* 

What is the status of my heart, is it perverse or blameless? Most certainly it is not blameless and very possible it is perverse. For what my heart longs in many cases is not what a righteous man would long for.

*21 Be sure of this: The wicked will not go unpunished,*
*but those who are righteous will go free.* 

I am in a dilemma right now, I do not know what I have to do. I want to improve the organization, by initiating a clean up team, a ministry policy, a core team for youth ministry, I wanted to invite a pastor experienced in speaking with youth. All things are what I wanted, yes, but for the good of the congregation, so that people may grow to know each other better and grow spiritually as well.
The first three things might start off, a little slower than I expected. I am not appreciating that enough, not being thankful enough, because it did not happen my way, at my speed, with the people I had in mind.
The last item, the pastor may not be invited.
Forgive me for that, Father, You have been more than a Provider, but I was only thinking about myself. You know what is best and I need to change.
You also know what needs to be done now with the summer conference, you will provide a speaker.

All I need to know is to stay righteous, do no attempt to do any unrighteous thing just to get my way. It is not even about a reward, it is only about being free and not being punished.

*22 Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout*
*is a beautiful woman who shows no discretion.* 

Do not care for looks, care for discretion. Care for the inside traits, and then look for the most important ones. Righteousness, discretion, love.

*23 The desire of the righteous ends only in good,*
*but the hope of the wicked only in wrath.* 

I know that the desires in a human being will lead a person to its destination. In fact I would say that the desires of a man can show the state of his righteousness. And if the Spirit enters a man, his desires will change and therefore his state of righteousness changes as well.
So it is not man who changes his desires, for that is impossible, but even if it were possible, he could not change his destiny with that, for his old sins would still be present in him. But it is the Holy Spirit that changes his desires and the Spirit would never enter a man unless He has been credited righteousness unto him.
So we can say that by a man's desires we can see his righteousness, yet not his own, but the righteousness credited unto him by God.

*24 One person gives freely, yet gains even more;*
*another withholds unduly, but comes to poverty.* 

Thank You for these wise words, oh Lord, help me to give more and more to You. Let me help build Your Kingdom with Your money. If you have given me the talent to work with money, use it wisely and calculate my spendings, and procure the church's needs, then use me to be good for you.
If you have instead given me ideas to start or lead a company, then let me do this and make money for You to spend it on Your Kingdom.
Or if you want to do miracles without money, please show us, oh Lord.

*25 A generous person will prosper;*
*whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.* 

Let me be generous as well and help others with my time and money. As much as You would like to see.

*26 People curse the one who hoards grain,*
*but they pray God’s blessing on the one who is willing to sell.*
 
 
The one who keeps everything to himself is cursed, just like Joe Pesci in *The Super*. But even he found out that giving gives much more pleasure and peace than keeping things for himself. 
 
 
*27 Whoever seeks good finds favor,*
*but evil comes to one who searches for it.*
 
 
Evil comes to those who *search* for it. Is that true? It must be if it is in the Proverbs. In a sense we look up evil. Not all evil done to us is because we looked it up, but that which is done to us, might cause us to look up evil. 
I am giving the example of a person who has been sexually abused. It is not his fault that this evil happened to him, but the possibility exists that he hates his attacker and lets this hatred grow, out of which evil will grow, or he could look up perverse sexual relations, such as homosexual relationships.
 
 
*28 Those who trust in their riches will fall,*
*but the righteous will thrive like a green leaf.*
 
 
Riches are not to put trust in. Money rolls, and a foundation built on money rolls away.
The righteous put their roots in the right things and will not only stay standing, but thrive as well.
 
 
*29 Whoever brings ruin on their family will inherit only wind,*
*and the fool will be servant to the wise.*
 
 
I should not bring ruin to anyone at all, but if I bring ruin to my family or to my church, I should not expect any inheritance. I have been neglecting my family and should not accept much from them.
 
 
*30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life,*
*and the one who is wise saves lives.*
 
 
If I am righteous I will see that by my fruit, which is life. Have people begun living through my deeds or wisdom?
 
 
*31 If the righteous receive their due on earth,*
*how much more the ungodly and the sinner!*
 
 
Know that you will receive your due on Earth.
