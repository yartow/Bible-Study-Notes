# Proverbs 12
*Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but whoever hates correction is stupid.*

I love knowledge, but I do not love to be disciplined. I love discipline, just not when I have to endure it. Eventually though I prefer it more than being loose. On a Saturday or Sunday for example, if not going to church, I still would rather wake up early do some things, instead of staying in my pajamas all day long.

But I do not hate to be corrected. I do hate it when people think they have the answer and then correct me, though. Sometimes they might be right, and then I am wrong for not willing to be corrected *.*

*Good people obtain favor from the Lord , but he condemns those who devise wicked schemes.*

Am I a good person or a bad one? I have devised wicked schemes, schemes to exclude certain people out of certain roles, so that my ideas would be more prominent. Now I see that this is the worldly way of working. And wicked in the eyes of God as well.
I have to let it go. Let God do the work. Whoever is in charge will have to stand before God one day and explain the decisions he made.
It is not my job to remove them from their seats.

*No one can be established through wickedness, but the righteous cannot be uprooted.*

Speaking of seats, their persona is not established through wickedness. They will never be worth more as a person, or be better judged or rewarded by God, through wickedness.
The righteous on the other hand will never be diminished in their value. As long as they put their roots in Jesus Christ, the will stand firm and stay alive.

*A wife of noble character is her husband’s crown, but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones.*

A wife who shows her friendliness and nobility to others is a pleasure for a husband, to make him proud, especially in front of others.
But a disgraceful wife hurts him, he does not want to tell about it, he cannot put her as an example of a good wife and mother, he cannot put himself as an example of a good husband and leader of the family, he cannot give an example of a good marriage, he does not want to go home, his home does not feel like his, his children will take over bad traits from his wife. He will not get any rest and he will get even more unrest when people ask about her. He had rather not show her in public — and most certainly not with him — he keeps feeling pressure of what and when people might ask him about his personal life, because he does not want to talk about it. Could there be anything worse?

*The plans of the righteous are just, but the advice of the wicked is deceitful.*
If someone is wicked, be careful even with his advice. Stay away from him if you can.
But a righteous person, though he may advice something wrong, be it on purpose or unconscientiously, his plan is just.

*The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, but the speech of the upright rescues them.*
What wicked people speak, is meant to come to action at the right time, but only to hurt others. But the words of upright people, is meant to rescue those who have remembered it.

*The wicked are overthrown and are no more, but the house of the righteous stands firm.*
*Proverbs 12:1-7 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.12.1-7.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.12.1-7.NIV)*
Eventually the wicked will be no more, but the righteous will stay. Sometimes a righteous person dies, but there will always be a new righteous person standing up. At least so long as the world is not ending in

*8 A person is praised according to their prudence,*
*and one with a warped mind is despised.*

Being prudent is not a bad thing at all. In this world it may seem like fear, but caution is a wise thing, especially with unknown things and persons, and especially with those persons with warped, that is tangled, minds.

*9 Better to be a nobody and yet have a servant*
*than pretend to be somebody and have no food.*

Be factual, what do we have, material or air? Even pretending is air within air. The status that comes with pretending is not real.

*10 The righteous care for the needs of their animals,*
*but the kindest acts of the wicked are cruel.*

The wicked try to give to charity, but even that what they do is cruel. Their amount is too little for their income, their motive is wrong, they do it for self-glory, and the cause they give to is immoral, they help out foundations which are not aligned with God's morals.

*11 Those who work their land will have abundant food,*
*but those who chase fantasies have no sense.*

I know You want Your people to work hard, for that is a good thing, and sloth, on other hand, is one of the worst sins.
Teach me to work hard, Lord, and not only for the things I like to do, but also - and especially so - in situations I do not like, for there I can show Your love and accept Your power the most.
Give me strength for every day, and wisdom for all my life. If my strength should decrease, then let Yours increase.

*12 The wicked desire the stronghold of evildoers,*
*but the root of the righteous endures.*

Lord, please bless Africa. It is a country that seems to be possessed by leaders that do evil and hurt their own people. Why is that so?
Is it because of their race? Or because of their poverty which causes them to want to rise above another?
India is so big and has one ruler, and does not care about its own people either, but does not have warlords such as Africa, with guns and child soldiers. Many people in Asia do not have religion and are in a similar situation as Africa, like Vietnam and Cambodia, but the situation still seems less severe than Africa.
Is it because of the history of colonialism, which set an example for the warlords?
Granted, Asians does not have so much drought and can more easily make a living in agricultural products, but India has the same problem in several places.

TODO OPZOEKEN
Why Africa?
Is it because their forefathers were wicked? All the way back to Ham

*13 Evildoers are trapped by their sinful talk,*
*and so the innocent escape trouble.*

Father, I really need Your advice on this. I feel like I am lying more and more, my whole work is not fully honest, and this little bit of sin is like yeast working throughout the whole batch. It is affecting every part of my life, including my temper, my patience and my obedience to You.
I understand better now what it feels like to be trapped. To make the story fit, another lie needs to be told. And now my employer even needs his employees to lie.

*14 From the fruit of their lips people are filled with good things,*
*and the work of their hands brings them reward.*

If what we say brings fruit, it means we said good things, and if we did that, we would be filled with good thing ourselves as well. Just like with love, words are something that go in two directions. The more you throw out, the more of it is created in our hearts. And if we speak good words to others, we produce good character in our hearts.

*15 The way of fools seems right to them,*
*but the wise listen to advice.*

Lord, please help my friend and sister in Christ, YouShu, who thinks she is wise and even starts doubting some of Your Word.
Let her become wise and listen to Your voice.

Bidden voor tweede kind
Voor verslaving
Voor doel en volgende stap in het leven
Als apart, dan carrière, tenzij carrière juist als missionair is.

*16 Fools show their annoyance at once,*
*but the prudent overlook an insult.*

This is a hard one for me, and many a time have I been foolish by being annoyed and going into arguments while I should have ignored or overlook it.

*17 An honest witness tells the truth,*
*but a false witness tells lies.*

Let me be the honest one, Lord, for I know of the consequences of telling lies. It is not merely my state of heart, but also my surrounding and situation which compels me to lie. I pray that these will be beneficial, but if not, if I need to learn to stay truthful in the most difficult and tempting situations, then let me enter these.

*18 The words of the reckless pierce like swords,*
*but the tongue of the wise brings healing.*

People who are not careful with their words and actions, the reckless, say things that will pierce the heart, taking a long time to heal afterwards.

*19 Truthful lips endure forever,*
*but a lying tongue lasts only a moment.*

It is good to hear that a lying tongue only lasts a moment. However, this does not mean that the consequences of lying will are temporary either.
Does this verse mean that the person who owns this tongue will last only a moment? Then that is very bad news for me.

*20 Deceit is in the hearts of those who plot evil,*
*but those who promote peace have joy.*

It does not matter for what cause you are doing things, if you think the cause – or the end – justifies the means, you are deceiving yourself. Because while you are thinking you are doing something right, you know deep inside that you are not and that causes a conflict between your heart and mind, or your will and your spirit.
But if you promote peace, you know that your spirit, which is the Holy Spirit, wants that as well and in your mind you know that is the right choice as well, then joy will come.

*21 No harm overtakes the righteous,*
*but the wicked have their fill of trouble.*

Still I find this hard to interpret. I am willing to believe everything the Lord says, even if my eyes see differently. The latter part is easy to believe, that the wicked have their fill of trouble. For sure that is true, sooner or later, they all perish without peace and hope. But some of the righteous die without ever seeing righteousness. Christians may die as well, but at least their spirit is not harmed, but how about non-believing righteous people?

*22 The Lord detests lying lips,*
*but he delights in people who are trustworthy.*

If the Lord *detests* something, you should be very careful of this thing. It is not even murder the Lord mentions here, although He detests that as well, but *lying* lips. For lying causes breaches, however small, in your defense, which allows the devil to enter and plants seeds of doubt, distrust and dismal. 

*23 The prudent keep their knowledge to themselves,*
*but a fool’s heart blurts out folly.*

It is not wise to boast with knowledge. Also, speaking pompously might hurt others when said in the wrong way and at the wrong time.

*24 Diligent hands will rule,*
*but laziness ends in forced labor.*

Diligence has always been my motto, I just have not always put it in practice.
I have seen in life that lazy people end up doing hard work. They were lazy in school and now have to work physically even harder than the ones who were not lazy. They make less money and almost never get to the level or status the ones who worked hard, are at. Not that money or status is important, but just noticing this result. For although money and status might not be important, it is of great use for the kingdom of God, it gives good testimony when a wealthy man donates his money and uses his status to promote God and His Laws.

*25 Anxiety weighs down the heart,*
*but a kind word cheers it up.*

Through anxiety the heart weights heavy and not a lot of things can be done when your heart is heavy. Anxiety can be removed, however, not by being strict, like army commanders, but by giving a kind word.
Lord, let me be aware of my words, that next time I see an anxious person, I will not be against him and suppress him, but be encouraging and leading him. Not coincidentally this is what is the Rose of Leary says. What Leary discovered, was written all along in the Bible.

*26 The righteous choose their friends carefully,*
*but the way of the wicked leads them astray.*

You want me to choose friends who can help me with staying clean. Friends whom I can trust and help me stay on the right path.
Situations where I have gone wrong, can prove whether they are good friends or not.

*27 The lazy do not roast[a] any game,*
*but the diligent feed on the riches of the hunt.*

By diligence one will enjoy the result. It does not say how many times he has failed, but eventually he will eat. That is what I need to do. No matter how many times I have failed, I must continue to work hard in order to enjoy the result.

*28 In the way of righteousness there is life;*
*along that path is immortality.*

Only along that way can I find life. Only by granting others righteousness, and by that I mean taking care of others as a care keeper, as a steward, which means I should not exploit them or make us of them and unfairness done to them I must not accept.
