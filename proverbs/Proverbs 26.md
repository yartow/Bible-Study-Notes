# Proverbs 26
*Like snow in summer or rain in harvest, honor is not fitting for a fool.*

A fool is not someone who is unintelligent. Such a person may deserve honor for certain accomplishments. A fool is someone who deliberately chooses to do wrong, with all his intelligence. For that matter it can be said that the smarter he is, the bigger a fool he is.
A fool cannot do something honorable, for if he did, he would not be a fool anymore.

So if we consider Donald Trump as a fool, for going after all this sins in his life, wealth amass, divorce and lust, even though he knows it is wrong, if Trump does something honorable it does not mean he is not a fool anymore and he should not receive honor for that.
That is quite difficult to pose as a statement, I might add, because then Winston Churchill #tags/famouspeople, who probably was a drunk even during his days of glory in the Second World War #tags/historic events/wwii#, did provide the county with hope.
Even if he had done it for honor alone or out of pride and self praise, should he not be rewarded for this at all, just because he is a drunk?
Unfortunately, I do not have the answer to that question.

*Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow, an undeserved curse does not come to rest.*
 
 
What would happen if someone curses an innocent man for no reason? Would that person be cursed? No, for God executes the cursus and He will not let innocent men suffer. The curse of the devil is not merely strong enough to break the love and righteousness of God.
Therefore be in peace and know that all curses of this world will not harm you, even though the world may touch you on the outside. If your heart is innocent and above reproach you have nothing to fear.
 
 
*A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools!* 

Some things are fitting for some people. Fools do not need reasoning, for that is not fitting for them, they need a rod.
As I have noticed in my life there are some people who know the truth, but do not understand it nor obey it. There is a even a Christians whom I have heard say out loudly that he is "just" the (stubborn) type that needs to fall, before he will will learn. In other words, he is saying that he they will keep on sinning until God punishes him and he has no way out anymore.
Even the Israelites were not that foolish. They did not know what they were doing wrong and did not have enough sense in them to listen to God, but this Christian knows what is wrong, but wants to enjoy maximum autonomy for as long as possible.

*Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be just like him.*
*Answer a fool according to his folly, or he will be wise in his own eyes.*
 
 
This is a beautiful piece of wisdom. On the one hand we should not even bother answering the fool, on the other, we should, but in the right way. The latter is the key phrase here, *in the right way*. 
If we approach fools with reasoning and assumptions, we are mere fools ourselves, wasting our energy on those who will not understand anyway.
But if we approach them fittingly, and approaching them with a rod is not always possible, then they might listen.
 
 
*Sending a message by the hands of a fool is like cutting off oneʼs feet or drinking poison.*
 
 
I do not remember how many times I have sent a message through someone who did not deliver the exact words and feelings I had provided, but there is at least one occurrence where my message had hurt someone. Partly due to my message, but I suppose partly due to the way of bringing it by the messenger. Though this situation was not anywhere near life-threatening, if it were, one may say I had put my life in the hands of the messenger.
This messenger of mine was no fool and even then the situation was serious. What would happen if he were a fool? The consequences are not to be overseen.
 
 
*Like the useless legs of one who is lame is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.*
 
 
I do not know if a lame person would rather be amputated or not. In fact he would be dragging dead weight with him all the time. But still, it looks better to have two legs than none.
Perhaps so it is with fools. Without any wise words the fool might look even more foolish, but not having those would be more fitting. For wise words and proverbs he has no use and he could even lead people astray, so it is better he has not have them.
 
 
*Like tying a stone in a sling is the giving of honor to a fool.*
*Proverbs 26:1‭-‬8 NIV*
[http://bible.com/111/pro.26.1-8.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.26.1-8.NIV)

Tying a stone in a sling is useless, it is not effective at all unless you can throw the stone, which you cannot, because it is tied.
Just so it is with giving honor to a fool. You might think there is some effectivity, maybe you can bend the fool's mind, or perhaps he will be honored and then more willing to listen to you, but no, it is completely useless.

*Proverbs 26:9-12 (NIV)*
*9 Like a thornbush in a drunkard’s hand*
*is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.*
 
 
A drunkard will think he has a bottle or wine sack in his hand and bring it to his mouth. It will hurt him as soon as he does so.
So will a proverb. It does not belong in the mouth of a fool and will only hurt him.
 
 
*10 Like an archer who wounds at random*
*is one who hires a fool or any passer-by.*
 
 
In the same way a fool will hurt others. It could even be said that you are a fool if you do not listen to this advice. For who would hire a passer-by to do work without even knowing his credentials?
 
 
*11 As a dog returns to its vomit,*
*so fools repeat their folly.*
 
 
A dog is stupid in returning to something as dirty as its own vomit. That is what defines fools as well, they keep doing the same thing over.
In fact even we are being foolish when we are not fully recovered, for are we not simply repeating the same things we always do? We keep gambling, drinking or others things and keep hurting ourselves and others.
 
 
*12 Do you see a person wise in their own eyes?*
*There is more hope for a fool than for them.*

Pride is a dangerous thing for it blinds a person. It does not prevent them from doing riskful things and they cannot estimate the risk either.
By thinking they are wise, while they are not they will form their opinions and convince others of it. They are not willing to listen to others for they think they know better.
In this sense a fool is even better off. For he would not think he knows better perse.

*A sluggard says, “Thereʼs a lion in the road, a fierce lion roaming the streets!”*
 
 
A sluggard exaggerates to get things going, to get others doing things for him. Though hat is not the meaning of this verse, I need to be careful that I do not become like that.
The meaning of this verse is that the sluggard tries to find excuses to stay inside.
 
*As a door turns on its hinges, so a sluggard turns on his bed.*
 
 
This is what a sluggard does, sleeping all day long. Even when he is working, he will find whatever way to escape it.
Some sluggards I have known in life have always taken the easy way to graduate in school, but they could because of a good pair of brains. In life as well work hard when they have to or when they like something.
I do not know how to deal with these kind of people. I cannot motivate for everything
 
*A sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.*
 
 
I need to be careful that I myself will not become sluggish as in skipping meals just because I am too lazy to cook, finding excuses such as losing weight or time efficiency and concentration.
 
 
*A sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven people who answer discreetly.*
*Proverbs 26:13‭-‬16 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.26.13-16.NIV*

On the one hand I would say this about my own pastor, saying that at least seven people have mentioned something yet he still thinks otherwise, but to call him a sluggard, someone lazy, is not what fits him either.
On the other hand I need to be careful that I do not become sluggish or blind myself.

*Like one who grabs a stray dog by the ears is someone who rushes into a quarrel not their own.*
 
 
It is very unwise to get mixed up in a quarrel or a fight that is not mine. I feel a need to throw myself in and advise others, but that is the pride I have of (1) thinking I know better and (2) thinking I have the right to interfere.
Quite often I have been bitten back and when the dog is stronger than I am, eventually I am the one getting angry and hurt.
Foolish behavior while I was only trying to help. I had better spend my efforts on someone who is willing to receive my help.
 
 
*Like a maniac shooting flaming arrows of death*
*is one who deceives their neighbor and says, “I was only joking!”*
 
 
I have heard of at least one accident where people were joking and got others killed.
Deceiving us never a good thing and therefore I also oppose of games that include lying and deceiving, even if only for fun.
Using a pokerface and bluffing with poker games, that is raising the stakes, is one thing, but it is whole other thing to lie, even in games, because it allows us to go over that limit that God wants to protect us from.
 
 
*Without wood a fire goes out; without a gossip a quarrel dies down.*
 
 
Most recently I have been involved in a gossip, that even concerned me as the object. But leaving it aside for a while and nothing was heard of anymore.
Years ago something was said about me as well and I just left it as it was and the gossip died down.
That is, if fact the easiest way, and perhaps the best way of letting things go.
But what should one do if one's name has been smeared? Should I clear my name? Should I get the person who started the rumor about me?
Still, a question unanswered for me.
 
 
*As charcoal to embers and as wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome person for kindling strife.*
 
 
Most important is that no strife is present, because peaceful relationships are the most important thing. Though having no strife is not necessarily the same as having peace, because one can still have strife in his heart, but it is still better than having an actual fight.
In any case, it is best to remove the quarrelsome person to get back to peace.
 
 
*The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to the inmost parts.*
*Proverbs 26:17‭-‬22 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.26.17-22.NIV*

When someone gossips about you it hurts. It is as if this person has deliberately chosen to say this thing about you, and chosen to use the words that hurt most.

*Like a coating of silver dross on earthenware are fervent lips with an evil heart.*
 
 
It is a waste of precious silver to out it on earthenware. No one will see what is underneath, but it will be felt and the quality will shown to be what it is worth.
 
 
*Enemies disguise themselves with their lips, but in their hearts they harbor deceit.*
 
 
As mentioned above, there is always a layer on the inside with evil people. And the outside looks better than the inside.
But the outside can be shown in many ways. Where some may give to the poor, others are charming in their speech.
 
 
*Though their speech is charming, do not believe them, for seven abominations fill their hearts.*
 
 
The seven abominations that God hates, that probably is. Greed cannot be shown through lips, but only through one's actions, just like murder, sloth and adultery, and the other sins.
 
 
*Their malice may be concealed by deception, but their wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.*
 
 
It is in the assembly where their sins will be exposed. Now I am not sure what an assembly is, but I do know that if more people get together, the lies will be exposed, for one cannot deceive multiple people when all people know each other.
Therefore it is our task to become transparent with our group of people in order to prevent or detect the deceivers.
 
 
*Whoever digs a pit will fall into it; if someone rolls a stone, it will roll back on them.*
 
 
I need to do my best not to avenge whatever has been misdone to me. For it does not matter who started it, if I dig a pit for someone, I will be the one falling into it.
 
 
*A lying tongue hates those it hurts, and a flattering mouth works ruin.*
*Proverbs 26:23‭-‬28 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.26.23-28.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.26.23-28.NIV)*
 
 
If I am lying to you someone, I must hate that person. Why else would I lie? Some people lie to protect someone, but in fact they are destroying this person because this person will get a wrong perspective and experience of the truth.
It could be for example that someone always hears lies at home and then later in life will use lies as a way of living.
And perhaps I am lying to my beloved ones in order to protect myself, because I do not want them to know my dirty secrets. But then too I am in fact hating them, because I am not giving a good example of showing vulnerability, and instead am showing them that our hurts and sins must be hidden by lies, while that is the complete opposite of what the Lord teaches us.
