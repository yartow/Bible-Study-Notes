# Proverbs 1
*The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:*
*for gaining wisdom and instruction;*
*for understanding words of insight;*

Oh Lord Almighty, all-knowing and most wise God, You are Who You say You are. You are, forever. I wanted to say, *You are here forever*, but *here* will not be here forever, Earth will disappear one day. At the same time I rather not write that You are not in heaven forever, because that sounds like You are confined to heaven, while You are there and here and everywhere at the same time.
They say that man becomes wise after traveling throughout the Earth for a long time. You have created the Earth and it rests in Your hand. Your wisdom is unfathomable!
How can I be instructed? By listening to You, the One Who created everything and has written the instruction manual for everything.
Let me understand these Proverbs clearly, let me read these *words of insight* to get more insight in Your Word.

*for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and fair;*

Let me become prudent, for it is not enough to know what is right and just and fair.
Let me treat people equally, repay them what they deserve, and ...

*for giving prudence to those who are simple, knowledge and discretion to the young— let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance—*

Once again prudence is mentioned, but specifically for those who are spiritually superficial, while knowledge and discretion is for the young. So these Proverbs have several meanings, to anyone who is "simple" they provide prudence, and for the young they provide knowledge about things they did not know, as well as the correct behavior in communicating, which is discretion.
Those who are young can read it a first time to obtain these traits, and later on they can read it again to obtain prudence as well. But those who are already wise, can learn even more, and those who already *know* the difference between wrong and right, which is discerning, can get guidance on *doing* the right thing. This will provide everyone with an endless reading of the Proverbs.

Simple means in Hebrew someone who is gullible, without moral direction and inclined to evil.

*for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.*
*Proverbs 1:1-6 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.1.1-6.NIV*

Probably these proverbs are referring to general proverbs, wise sayings of old, such as Confucius' sayings and philosophies. Thus the Proverbs of Solomon can give insight into proverbs of others.
Indeed many of Confucius', Socrates' and Plato's writings are coinciding with the Bible, but where they are not coinciding, the Bible has the upper hand and provides most wisdom to all.
After all, the Bible is a living book, as well the Proverbs, which provide day to day advices while the Holy Spirit provides these daily to us as well.

*The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.*

Fools do not care for wisdom and instruction, so convincing them to come to the Lord in order to get knowledge, will not help. They do not fear the Lord at all, because they are blind and do not see His awesomeness.

*Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction and do not forsake your mother’s teaching. They are a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck.*
*Proverbs 1:7-9 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.1.7-9.NIV*

My father and mother have given me wisdom as well. Though not all of what they say is wise, some of it is. The wise words I remembered have protected me.

*My son, if sinful men entice you, do not give in to them.*

Before I go on to the next part, where it is written what those man can offer me and what I should do, I should not even consider joining them or even listening to them. They are sinful men, it is assumed I know they are. If I listen to them, I might give in to them. Therefore I should not even listen to them at all.

*If they say, “Come along with us; let’s lie in wait for innocent blood, let’s ambush some harmless soul; let’s swallow them alive, like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;*

In this part the reward is not even mentioned, that will come later. I should not consider this conspiracy, regardless of the reward. If I ask what I get in return, I have already sinned.

*we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder;*

If after two warnings I still do not listen, I will hear the reward which puts me into grave danger, a terribly attractive situation to become rich fast, by plundering others.
Help me, Lord, to not get into these kinds of situations. Help me to get far away from anything even slightly resembling this.

*cast lots with us; we will all share the loot”— my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths;*

Even something that will not hurt others directly, casting lots which is gambling, is warned against by the king, because it will lead to hurting myself and others.

*for their feet rush into evil, they are swift to shed blood.*

The reason why I must not trust these sinful men is because everything they undertake is evil and they are *swift* to shed blood, which means that they have no respect for human lives. 

*How useless to spread a net where every bird can see it! These men lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush only themselves!*

How come these men cannot see their own trap. Who does not know that gambling is addictive and that bloodshed will only lead to more bloodshed? They are blinded by their greed.

*Such are the paths of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the life of those who get it.*
*Proverbs 1:10-19 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.1.10-19.NIV*

Rather than taking life, taking a new life of materialism and welfare, their life is being taken. The previous verse indicates they should be able to see it like a net in the open, but still they are unknowing because they fix their eyes on something else.

*Out in the open wisdom calls aloud, she raises her voice in the public square; on top of the wall she cries out, at the city gate she makes her speech:*
*“How long will you who are simple love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?*

Wisdom is like a mother crying out for her children. Seeing what they are doing wrong yet not being able to stop them, because it is the children's own decision. In fact she is saying, *why are you being so stupid?* because they hate knowledge. 

*Repent at my rebuke! Then I will pour out my thoughts to you, I will make known to you my teachings.*

She is giving us a chance. Wisdom is forgiving and patient, and willing to teach us to make us wiser.

*But since you refuse to listen when I call and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand,*
*since you disregard all my advice and do not accept my rebuke, I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you; I will mock when calamity overtakes you— when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you.*
*Proverbs 1:20-27 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.1.20-27.NIV*

But she can be hard as well, she will not help when disaster strikes and even worse, she will laugh at us and mock us.
I am not sure if it is wise to laugh at someone in disaster, even when you have warned them. After all, it is also wisdom to bring someone to Christ, is it not?
But the Word of God is always right. When in doubt, assume you are wrong and the Bible is right.

*“Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me,*
*since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the Lord .*

Wisdom explains the reason why she is doing so. It is not because they did not listen before, but because they *hated* knowledge and *chose* not to fear the Lord.
I am not sure if this is applicable to the terrorists of the IS. Have they been indoctrinated perhaps, do the fear the Lord or do they fear the wrong lord? The devil has most surely made use of the situation by giving them inspiring thoughts of creating a new Islamic nation, but he could only do that after they had already given their hearts to their own desires. God surely must have spoken to them and their conscience must have prosecuted them, but they did not listen and were not willing to give over their lives

*Since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke, they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.*

In the first place it is not even God Who punishes them, they are punished by their own ways and schemes. They did not think their plans would backfire on them and did not realize every bad way has its consequences. Only few people manage to keep things a secret until their death and then too it is by the grace of God. Even still, they probably have lived with fear and unrest in their hearts all of their lives.
Most other criminals are caught in their own web. Their secret lives cause them to not be able to enjoy a family life, not to be open about their past or have any real friends when people discover the truth about their past. They sometimes need to kill to hide it or are getting killed for knowing too much.

*For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them;*
*but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm.”*
*Proverbs 1:28-33 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.1.28-33.NIV*

Being simple and ignoring things you see will eventually destroy you. But doing it the hard way, by being wise, that will bring you safety and rest, and it will remove the fear of harm to you and to those around you.
