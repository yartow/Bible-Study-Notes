# Proverbs 25
*1 These are more proverbs of Solomon, compiled by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah:*
 
 
*2 It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;*
*to search out a matter is the glory of kings.*
 
 
God does not ever need to search out a thing, because He knows everything already. But in His great and amazing forgiveness He conceals matters, also because He knows what is best and what is the outcome. We humans cannot do that for those are two things we cannot do, we do not know what is best and we do not know what will be the outcome.
For kings (of the Earth) there is therefore another role, and that is to search out the matter. It is of extreme importance for a king to know the matter of things before He judges. The goal is also to judge, whether guilty or not guilty, because if he does not judge, like David did with his own sons, his kingdom will come to an end. See also vv. 4,5.
 
 
*3 As the heavens are high and the earth is deep,*
*so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.*
 
 
Though this verse says that the hearts of kings are unsearchable, just like God's, it is not saying that it should be like this. On the contrary, a king should be looking for knowledge all the time to make better judgments.

*4 Remove the dross from the silver,*
*and a silversmith can produce a vessel;*
*5 remove wicked officials from the king’s presence,*
*and his throne will be established through righteousness.*
 
*Proverbs 25:1-5 (NIV)*

As long as the impurities are removed anything, for which it is purposed, can be built. With silver a vessel can be made and with a government a throne can be established.
In a church those who are cold or stir up chaos should be removed, in order to establish it and expand it.

*Do not exalt yourself in the kingʼs presence, and do not claim a place among his great men; it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,” than for him to humiliate you before his nobles.*
*Proverbs 25:6‭-‬7a NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.25.6-7.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.25.6-7.NIV)*
 
 
It is not in our place to exalt ourselves. God will raise the humble but He will humble the proud.
Of course it is better to be praised than to be humiliated, but it is also better to not have any praise than to be humiliated. So we just need to wait patiently and do our work until God says to us, *well done, you good and faithful servant*. 
 
 
*What you have seen with your eyes do not bring hastily to court, for what will you do in the end if your neighbor puts you to shame?*
*Proverbs 25:7b-8 NIV*
http://bible.com/111/pro.25.8.NIV

If you are wrong about what you think your neighbor has done, you will be ashamed in court. But even when you are right, in court all details will be discussed about everything that has happened. In movies we often see that lawyers even use dirty tricks in bringing up one's history.
Therefore it is better to talk things out privately instead of in court. It is for me better to talk things out with the people I have problems with than escalating it to a discussion on a higher level with the reverend, for example.

*If you take your neighbor to court, do not betray anotherʼs confidence, or the one who hears it may shame you and the charge against you will stand.* 
Proverbs 25:9‭-‬10 NIV

Though these two verses, and the previous two, vv. 7-8 are very similar, there are two different consequences. In the latter the consequence is that your privacy is spilled out in open court. In the former it is a charge against you that will stand.
In both cases the neighbor puts you to shame. We may think, "well, if he spills out my private details, I will put him to shame as well". Note that putting another person to shame is (almost synonymous) to betraying another's confidence. If you do so, the judge perhaps – but God most certainly – will have a charge against you.
So that is why we should not bring our neighbors to court, for we will be shamed and we cannot shame them back, and if we do so, we will still lose out.

*Like apples of gold in settings of silver is a ruling rightly given. Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold is the rebuke of a wise judge to a listening ear.*
*Proverbs 25:9‭-‬12 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.25.9-12.NIV*

Some things fit together perfectly, like diamonds in a setting on a ring. Some things do not.
Sometimes a rebuke is not fitting for someone and wisdom is not either.
What then needs to be said to a person who needs wisdom or rebuke? I do not know, but find something fitting.

*Like a snow-cooled drink at harvest time is a trustworthy messenger to the one who sends him; he refreshes the spirit of his master.*

Whenever I hear a message, whether it is good news or bad news does not matter, I need to know whether it is true before I can be relaxed. News that is too good to be true can get my hope up only to lose it later on. Bad news can depress my mood, while hearing it is better than expected, will not entirely compensate for the loss of mood.
It is better to receive trustworthy news for then I can prepare for what is coming.

*Like clouds and wind without rain is one who boasts of gifts never given.*

*Proverbs 25:13‭-‬14 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.25.13-14.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.25.13-14.NIV)*
 
 
One who brags about the stuff that he has but never shows it and probably does not have, does not help you at ll. It gets your hopes up, only to lose it afterwards.

 
 
Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a gentle tongue can break a bone.

Even Daniel could speak with a ruler a barbarous as Nebuchadnezzar and Esther with Xerxes or...
And Ezra with Cyrus??
Lord God, please teach me to control my tongue and have skills to patience in my words and attitude and a gentle tongue.
Saying I need to learn a pokerface and a sweet talking mouth is probably not what You want for me to ask. But You know Lord, what I need.

*If you find honey, eat just enough— too much of it, and you will vomit.*
*Seldom set foot in your neighborʼs house— too much of you, and they will hate you.*
*Proverbs 25:15‭-‬17 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.25.15-17.NIV*
 
 
At first I thought what these two verses have got to do with each other, honey and neighbors. But afterwards I figured out that going to your neighbor is a good thing, like honey, it builds relationships and we can help out each other.
However, it is very intense, like honey as well. Though honey is healthy it contains a lot of calories and will peak your blood sugar. It is bad for your insulin production as well.
How appropriate is this for my current neighbors, who are friendly people, whom I need every now and then, but whom I most definitely do not want to see too often.
 
 
*Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow is one who gives false testimony against a neighbor.*
*Like a broken tooth or a lame foot is reliance on the unfaithful in a time of trouble.*
*Like one who takes away a garment on a cold day, or like vinegar poured on a wound, is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.*
*Proverbs 25:18‭-‬20 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.25.18-20.NIV*

These analogies are so true. Some of them are to remind us of that which we already know, but some of them might be new to us.
The situation of one having a heavy heart for example, is a difficult one for me to estimate what is the right thing to do. Do I have to cheer up this person, or grieve with him?

The one about the broken tooth is very applicable to me, as I once had a broken tooth. I had never seen it coming and all of a sudden a piece chipped off of my molar, and the next day more came off.
My tooth was not there for me when I needed it and when it came off I could not do anything anymore.
It would have been better if I did not have that tooth at all.

*If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.*
*In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you.*
 
 
It is a very hard thing to do, to feed your enemy and it stands in stark contrast with killing your enemies which is what many of the Israelites have done during the wars. When are we allowed to kill and when to feed them?
The answer to the former comes from God alone, for God only knows a man's heart and knows when a heart is hardened so much it cannot be saved anymore.
I think the command right now is to feed our enemies and love upon them. No matter how strange this feels to us or how hard it is, for it is a command and until God says otherwise, it is the only right thing to do.
 
 
*Like a north wind that brings unexpected rain is a sly tongue—which provokes a horrified look.*
*Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.*
*Proverbs 25:21‭-‬24 NIV*
[http://bible.com/111/pro.25.21-24.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.25.21-24.NIV)

People with sly tongues should not be trusted, that is what we all know already. But we still need to be reminded of that and of the consequences it brings.
Do not fall for anyone using sweet words, giving you compliments and so, rather be on your guard when someone does so.

*Like cold water to a weary soul is good news from a distant land.*
*Like a muddied spring or a polluted well are the righteous who give way to the wicked.*
 
 
Wells and springs which are supposed to be providing people with life, are not much good when they are polluted. So are the "righteous" who give way to the wicked. These people cannot be trusted anymore and it is not clear what their purpose is anymore.
I would say Angelina Jolie is such an example, she probably gives a lot of her money to good causes and promotes these as well, but in the mean time she promotes LGBT rights in wrong way and stars in movies with explicit sex scenes.

*It is not good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable to search out matters that are too deep.*
 
 
Just like honey is a good thing, it is good to search out matters, just not too deep. Going too deep will let you focus all of your time on one thing only, while there other things that are important as well. In other words, it is not efficient.
Also, diving too deep will let you get you in touch with other things that require a lot of research as well, which will cost you even more time.
The consequence of this is that you will lose contact with those things and people who are in your life right now.
 
 
*Like a city whose walls are broken through is a person who lacks self-control.*

*Proverbs 25:25‭-‬28 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.25.25-28.NIV*

It does not matter how big a city is, as soon as its walls are broken through it is exposed. The enemy enters and takes all goods with him.
A person who lacks self-control has this breach in his wall. The devil knows this is his weak point and therefore uses it to lure him out. As soon as it is breached he lets this person sin, and many who lack self-control do so by cursing, using violence or irrational thinking and in this way sin.
Yet all of us lack self-control in a certain way. For some it is a porn addiction, for others it is a bad temper and the lack of patience or raising one's needs above God's Laws.
There is a guy in my church who recently has put on some tattoos. The problem I have with that is not that he has not given any thought about it, for then I would deem him a naïve, but I presume he has thought about it but willingly did not want to think more about it, and willingly did not ask anyone for advise, because he did not want to hear that he should not do it.
It is this putting of his own wishes above that of God that I oppose to and that I see in his life. He loves God, but not with all of his heart. And that is what the devil will use in him.
