# Proverbs 8
*Does not wisdom call out? Does not understanding raise her voice?*
*At the highest point along the way, where the paths meet, she takes her stand;*
*beside the gate leading into the city, at the entrance, she cries aloud:*

Wisdom must go hand in hand with understanding. One might know what wisdom is, but it does not mean he understands why it is wisdom. One might understand wisdom after hearing it, but might not know what wisdom is in a certain situation.
And wisdom is strategic, she shouts beside the gate leading into the city. She warns not to go into it or to be careful. She is standing at the right position to have the most effect.
A lesson for me to learn, instead of wanting my way, I need to be strategic in order to tell others about wisdom.

*“To you, O people, I call out; I raise my voice to all mankind.*

Wisdom raises her voice to *all* mankind. I must not make any exceptions. I must keep listening to her voice, which is the Holy Spirit.

*You who are simple, gain prudence; you who are foolish, set your hearts on it.*

The word for simple is translated "unwise". And usually this is true. Those who choose the easiest path are not being wise, and those who do not think further than their own thoughts, are simple in a sense, and not using the wisdom there is. Not *their* wisdom, obviously, because they do not have it, but the wisdom that can be found by listening to God or from the Bible.

*Listen, for I have trustworthy things to say; I open my lips to speak what is right.*

We must trust wisdom that what she says is right and trustworthy. When we hear her voice so softly, it is of utmost importance that we do not add a layer of doubt over it.

*My mouth speaks what is true, for my lips detest wickedness.*
*All the words of my mouth are just; none of them is crooked or perverse.*
*To* *the discerning all of them are right; they are upright to those who have found knowledge.*

If I want to be like wisdom I have to speak only the truth as well, to detect wickedness even before I say things. My lips must be connected to my heart for that reason.
I must be clean and just. Discerning and upright.

*Choose my instruction instead of silver, knowledge rather than choice* *gold* *,*  
*f* *or* *wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire can compare with her.*
*Proverbs 8:1-11 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.8.1-11.NIV*

Whatever I can think of, how lovely it might be, how awesome or powerful, like a computer or a car, nothing can compare with the beauty and splendor of wisdom.

*“I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence; I possess knowledge and discretion.*

What is prudence? It is being careful. Wisdom dwells together prudence. I cannot be wise and walk over anyone's feelings. Wisdom would tell me to wait, to touch upon others' feelings before I make decisions. She would tell me to shut my mouth and guard my lips, that nothing bad comes out of it, as well as what I write.

*To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have insight, I have power.*

To have wisdom is to have power. Solomon only had power in name, but because of his wisdom people started to respect him even more.
I must hate evil, because loving evil does not go together with fearing God.

*By me kings reign and rulers issue decrees that are just;*
*by me princes govern, and nobles—all who rule on earth.*

All power some people here on Earth think they have, is ultimately obtained from God. And all awe and respect they have is derived from wisdom.

*I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me.*

I must love wisdom and wisdom will love me back. If I do not listen to her or talk to her, she will not talk to me either.
I must care about her more than I care about myself. Even if I do not like to do something, I ought to do it for her.

*With me are riches and honor, enduring* *wealth* *and prosperity.*

If I want to be rich, I must be with wisdom. Yet wisdom is providing me something worth even more than riches, honor, enduring wealth and prosperity. It can offer me life, the way God intended it to be. Being free from sin, by walking the way God wants me to walk.

*My fruit is better than fine gold; what I yield surpasses choice silver.*

The love of money is so often the root of evil and that is why it is of such importance that I know that what wisdom yields is better than fine gold and choice silver. Gold is nothing but a metal, if you think about it, and diamond is nothing but a mineral. It is the value people have attached to it. It has become a symbol. People like to swim in gold or money, but that is just as stupid as swimming in rocks or in trash paper.
But wisdom, if one could swim in there and drink it, that would be a wise thing to do. It would not weigh as much as gold, though it would still take some effort to obtain and keep it, but storage of it – as well as the source – would be endlessly.

*I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,*
*bestowing a rich inheritance on those who love me and making their treasuries full.*
*Proverbs 8:12-21 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.8.12-21.NIV*

An inheritance it is indeed, for if wisdom is truly accepted, the person will pass it on.

*“The Lord brought me forth as the first of his works, before his deeds of old;*

The first thing that is remarkable about Jesus when He lived here on Earth, was His wisdom and knowledge. He knows what to say and what to do or not to do.

*I was formed long ages ago, at the very beginning, when the world came to be.*
*When there were no watery depths, I was given birth, when there were no springs overflowing with water;*
*before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was given birth,*
*before he made the world or its fields or any of the dust of the earth.*

Wisdom was here before anything was here. Everything that happens, wisdom has seen it coming or even happen before.
Wisdom knows more than I do, she has not benefit in lying. She sees the bad results flowing out of an action and only wants to prevent this. She has the best intentions for us, why would she wants us to fail? She knows it is bad for her God and her father as well.

*I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,*
*when he established the clouds above and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,*
*when he gave the sea its boundary so the waters would not overstep his command, and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.*

Wisdom has seen all beauty coming out of nothing, how God has created everything, and she has seen how humans have destroyed this as well.
She knows what will happen, she can see the signs and she is only warning us.

*Then I was constantly at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence, rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind.*
*Proverbs 8:22-31 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.8.22-31.NIV*

I am not sure when *then* took place, but wisdom was still young, and she was an artisan. Perhaps she was helping God sculpt out wonderful creatures, the animals, or the wonders of nature, such as its (mathematical) patterns and intricate laws.
Or she was helping out mankind, Adam and Eve, and perhaps a few generations after that, when things had not gone too bad yet, with her wisdom, giving Adam wisdom to name all animals and bestowing mankind with almost limitless talents and wisdom, such as music and carpentry.

*“Now then, my children, listen to me; blessed are those who keep my ways.*
*Listen to my instruction and be wise; do not disregard it.*
*Blessed are those who listen to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at my doorway.*
*For those who find me find life and receive favor from the Lord .*
*But those who fail to find me harm themselves; all who hate me love death.”*
*Proverbs 8:32-36 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.8.32-36.NIV*

Once again wisdom says we need to *fnd* her and that we will pay for it ourselves if we do not find her. Is that honest? Yes, because she has been shouting form rooftops and warning us many times. See also the first verses in this chapter and Chapter 9.
It is not that she sends us to death, it is that we have been looking for it all along. For the reason why they fail to find wisdom, is because they were looking in the wrong places. They were looking for death.
In other words, they were looking for pleasure, fun and lust. Everything that satiates them. In fact, they did not find wisdom because they were not even looking for her.
I do not think they love death per se, but going down the wrong road, is equal to going to die. Loving that road equals death. Perhaps not at the beginning, but somewhere along that line they should know that it is a road leading to death.
