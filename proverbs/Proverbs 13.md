# Proverbs 13
*A wise son heeds his father’s instruction, but a mocker does not respond to rebukes.* 

Lord, I know I am stubborn, but please let me become wise. Let me grow to become more like You. I am afraid to humble myself, to not only not be the best, but also to be the worst.
But for Your sake I am willing to, Lord. If that will raise You up, I am willing to be out down.

*From the fruit of their lips people enjoy good things, but the unfaithful have an appetite for violence.* 

This is perhaps the third reference to the fruit of the lips. Apparently there is a lot of result from what one says, and there is a lot of good result from saying good and wise things.
The unfaithful, on the other hand, have not much good to say and what they say will lead to violence.
Donald Trump is one of these men, what he is saying is not causing peace, just like Geert Wilders.

*Those who guard their lips preserve their lives, but those who speak rashly will come to ruin.* 

Lord, help me once more, please, for I need to learn to guard my lips. Teach me to be patient with using words. Even more so I need my heart to be cleansed.

*A sluggard’s appetite is never filled, but the desires of the diligent are fully satisfied.* 

How ironic, one would expect a sluggard, who does not use any energy at all to be satisfied with just a little bit, but it appears to be that he is never satisfied. Yet still he does not want to work for it.
The hard worker, the diligent, on the other hand is fully satisfied.
I still need to understand that last thing. Perhaps I can understand it a little bit, because when I work hard, it is for a goal and I want to reach that goal. If I have that, I am satisfied. Or it could be, those that work hard know how hard it is to get money, and will not easily ask for much.
For example, I know how it is to lead a group, I will not ask God quickly to give me a church let alone a mega church.

*The righteous hate what is false, but the wicked make themselves a stench and bring shame on themselves.* 

If you hate something you will keep away from it as far as possible. But if you are wicked, you love what others hate and this love will make you stink. It cannot be hidden anymore, just like a stench, and it will bring shame on you.
The same happened to me with girls. I loved girls and no matter how serious I was, it became noticeable and I got a reputation because of it of which I was ashamed.

*Righteousness guards the person of integrity, but wickedness overthrows the sinner.* 

But when a man is righteous, he will be guarded when he is unaware of danger. A wrong woman who would cause him a bad reputation, would be found out by him, by her unrighteous traits, thoughts and actions.
If only I were righteous back then, I would have known that my first ex-girlfriend was one of such women. Her materialistic and sexually immoral thoughts and actions have indeed overthrown me, thrown me into a life of sin, but only because – as the verse already says – I already was a sinner. For if I were righteous, I would have rejected her, but because I was sinful, I gave in to her and my lusts.

*One person pretends to be rich, yet has nothing; another pretends to be poor, yet* *has* *great wealth.* 

Lord, let me not pretend to be rich, for I am not and probably will never be. No, most surely I will never be, because I have made you a promise to give all of my wealth to you and keep only for myself what I need.

*A person’s riches may ransom their life, but the poor cannot respond to threatening rebukes.*
*Proverbs 13:1-8 NIV*
[http://bible.com/111/pro.13.1-8.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.13.1-8.NIV) 

A poor man cannot respond to threatening rebukes. He cannot – or *may* not – respond in a manner of giving in. He has got nothing to lose, so he should not be afraid of threats, and therefore always put God first. 
However, “cannot” could also mean “is not able to”, for he has no money to give. In this sense the poor person is the one in a negative light. Proverbs is advising us to be rich, for that can save your life, while being poor cannot save your life, because you have nothing to give in return.
Of course this is not being rich in terms of money, but in terms of wisdom and knowledge. If you have nothing to give, why should someone let you live?

*The light of the righteous shines brightly, but the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out.* 

At this moment I feel like I am snuffed out, but I may know that I have been declared righteous in God.

*W* *here* *there is strife, there is pride, but wisdom is found in those who take advice.* 

Surely in my case there is always pride. In the meeting for the summer conference I got frustrated because some of the people would not use my suggestions. I still do not think my suggestions were wrong, but the reason I got frustrated was probably mostly not because of what they chose is not the best thing for the attenders of the conference, but because of my pride who had been offended.
Also, I must say, but their simple-mindedness – and I mean stupidity – and lack of vision and arguments, which surprised me.

*Dishonest money dwindles away, but whoever gathers money little by little makes it grow.* 

Lord, let me not go for dishonest money. Let the thought of money disappear completely from my mind and even things I want to buy with money. Let only your wil come into my mind. Let my money troubles disappear from my mind as well and put all of my worries completely in Your hands.

*Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.* 

Without hope I have nothing to live for. No place where I can rest, no place where I belong or have joy. But in Your courts I know I may rest.
If my longings are fulfilled I will flourish like a tree, in every bud a new leaf, and between the leaves, birds and nests of new birds.
Give me hope, Lord, because I cannot find it anywhere. The hope I have in You, that You will keep Your promise, that You will work out everything for the good of us, is the only hope I have.

*Whoever scorns instruction will pay for it, but whoever respects a command is rewarded.* 

Every instruction we get, from non-believers as well, if we know it is a good instruction, as a Christian we should follow it. If we scorn it, I think that means to ridicule it, we will pay for it.
But when we respect a command, we will be rewarded. There is nothing to add to this verse to make it more clear.

*The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, turning a person from the snares of death.* 

Wisdom can turn a person from death, and I think even literally, but mostly this is about the spiritual death.
How often have we not seen that those who are entrapped in the snares of death are those who did not listen to God's wisdom?
Those who decided to pair with an unbeliever decreased in wisdom, their decisions for God were less convincing and with less power.
Their frequency of coming to church is going down, I do not know about how often they are reading the Bible, but it surely does not show in their life. Slowly they are drifting away from You, Lord, unless You grant them Your mercy you open their eyes again.

*Good judgment wins favor, but the way of the unfaithful leads to their destruction.* 

Yet again I do not know for sure whether I had good judgment or not, for I have not won the favor of many, and though I have not been destroyed, it does not seem like I have any impact on the Kernteam Jongeren, ie the Youth Ministry core leadership team.
It seems like their trust in me has been destroyed. It could also be that it never even existed. Or could it be that the problem is them?

*All who are prudent act with knowledge, but fools expose their folly.* 

Now I yet again do not know whether I am prudent or the fool. In the Youth Ministry core group I was most certainly acting with knowledge, not basing my suggestions on feelings *,* but on knowledge. Of course I was not excluding feelings, because he goal of the Youth Ministry core group is to be in the best interest for the youth and what is best for them can known by understanding their feelings.
The fools, my opponents in this case, expose their folly, their foolishness, but not having any valid arguments for their point of views.

*A wicked messenger falls into trouble, but a trustworthy envoy brings healing.* 

Even if only passing a message, and even if he is alone, if the messenger is wicked he will fall into trouble, even though there is a rule not to kill the messenger.
But with an envoy, though that may stir up fears and army-like feelings, when it is trustworthy it brings healing.
So the outside does not matter as much as the reputation, that is trust.

*Whoever disregards discipline comes to poverty and shame, but whoever heeds correction is honored.* 

It is as if I have come across this verse before, nevertheless it is necessary to repeat this. Do not disregard discipline, my friend, listen to it. And I am talking about being disciplined here. It is not so much a punishment as it is an act of love.
If you are corrected, you will only grow. It could be a wrong correction, but your will is still trained and you will grow to become more obedient, to God as well.

*A longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul, but fools detest turning from evil.* 

I do not really understand this. What is the relationship between a longing and a detestable thing? They are opposites of course, but in this case I still do not understand it.
Fools detest turning from evil, "thus" the wise long turning from evil. Can I say that in doing so their longing is fulfilled? But the fools could have their own longings as well, right?
TODO OPZOEKEN meaning of this verse.

*Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm.* 

I should spend my time with wise people and not with unwise. I have the feeling that that is a confirmation that I should not spend my time on the Youth Ministry core group. A hint even that it might have worse consequences if I stayed in it, for I would suffer harm and not become wise (or perhaps even become unwise).
Lord, protect me from harm, protect me from my own pride in thinking that I will not suffer harm, for I will and I am very sensitive for harm.
The reason why I think I am not so vulnerable is because You have always protected me and raised me up whenever I was down. Whenever I was damaged, You have healed me. Therefore I have always thought my own healing abilities would make me sort of invulnerable, but I did not realize two things.
If it is true that you have given me these abilities, I have forgotten to give you honor for that, because You might just as well take it all away from me. Or if You have not given me these abilities, then I was cropping up my feelings in order not to feel any hurting. That will come out as well, eventually, and then in a worse way.
Father, please help me to know these wise men, where are they and who are they? What should I learn from them? Teach me to accept them and become friends with them.

*Trouble pursues the sinner, but the righteous are rewarded with good things.* 

It sometimes feels like I am the sinner, because trouble pursues me, but I know how blessed I am, for if You were not blessing me, I would have much more trouble. In that sense I feel like the righteous again, because I am being rewarded with good things all the time.

*A good person* *leaves* *an inheritance for their children’s children, but a sinner’s wealth is stored up for the righteous.* 

In this verse, however, I feel yet again like the sinner in one sense, because my wealth is not stored for me. It is all going away somewhere, to taxes, to debts. But my not worldly wealth, my knowledge and faith, my loyalty to and love for God, all these are hopefully being transferred to my son and hopefully he will pick that up as well.

*An unplowed field produces food for the poor, but injustice sweeps it away.*
 
If a field is unplowed, it cannot produce any food at all, I would think. Perhaps this is a warning for the poor. They are poor because they did not work hard enough, they did not prepare their field by plowing it and that is why they are poor.
If this answer is true, I do not know where the alternate verse is, as these verses in proverbs always show a wise and unwise person. 

*Proverbs 13:23 (ESV) The fallow ground of the poor would yield much food,*
*but it is swept away through injustice.*
**Update 20191118 based on ESV.** My current interpretation based on the NIV is that an unplowed field does produce food, but only a little. A little bit of food then would be called food for the poor. However, that little that the poor have would also be seized by the unjust people, such as the (local) government and its #todo/opzoeken/engels uitvoerders. 
Based on the ESV on the other hand, I get to a different conclusion.  
 
::*Whoever spares the rod hates their children, but the one who loves their children is careful to discipline them.*:: #biblestudy/memorization 
 
One of my favorite verses. Not because I like to discipline children that much, but because I really think and feel like that this is for some children the way to do it. Using the rod, with caution, will burn things in their mind as well.

*The righteous eat to their hearts’ content, but the stomach of the wicked goes hungry.*
*Proverbs 13:9-25 NIV*
 
 
[I](http://bible.com/111/pro.13.9-25.NIV) f you are righteous, you will have enough to eat, but if you are wicked, you will never have enough. Even though the wicked can be rich, they never have enough status or wealth and lie awake for more. The righteous on the other hand, whether rich or poor, have enough to their hearts’ content. They do not wish for a lot, so they do not need a lot. This is one of the secrets to satisfaction. 
This is not the same, however, as the Buddhistic thought of not wanting anything. We just do not want anything for ourselves.
