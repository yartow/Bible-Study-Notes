# Proverbs 3
*My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart,*
*for they will prolong your life many years and bring you peace and prosperity.*
*Proverbs 3:1-2 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.3.1-2.NIV*

God wants me to memorize His commands, because they will prolong my life. I think the keyword is in the part after that, *peace and prosperity*.
Prolonging my life would not have any value if I were to live only for myself. But if I live for God and serve Him in these years, it does have value. Peace and prosperity will come automatically when I serve God.

*Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.*

Love for God and being faithful to Him and His Law and inherently His wisdom. By binding them around my neck I can only remove them if my head is removed as well.
This means that I must figuratively lose my mind as well before I can lose my faithfulness to God.
Binding them on my neck means they will somewhat rest on my heart. My faithfulness is not mind based, it is heart based. It says in this verse to write them on your heart (as well).
If these are written on both heart and mind, what can take it away?
Solomon lost his mind because he gave his heart to Gentile and pagan women and a multitude of that.

**Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.**
**Proverbs 3:3-4 NIV**
**http://bible.com/111/pro.3.3-4.NIV**

Wisdom surpasses all cultures and religions. In God's sight especially I will have a good name if I adhere to His wisdom, but in man's sight as well, sooner or later.

*Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;*

With *all* of my heart and *not* my own understanding. But how should I use my wisdom or mind then? It does not say *do not use*, but it says *do not lean* on it.

*in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.*
*Proverbs 3:5-6 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.3.5-6.NIV*

All of my ways, does that mean I cannot go any of my own ways anymore? It means that in all of my ways I cannot go there *on my own way*, it means that whatever way I choose, I must submit to God in it. In my work I must submit to Him, and in my family and choosing my friends.

*Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord and shun evil.*

*In my own eyes* is the keyword here. Then what is objective wisdom? *Fearing the Lord and shunning evil*. My character does not shun danger, mountain climbing and fast cars are what excite me. But danger comes in evil forms as well, if the former were not evil enough.
I should shun danger, the danger of seduction, temptation, temptation of sex, power and materialism, of selfishness self glory.

*This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones.*
*Proverbs 3:7-8 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.3.7-8.NIV*

Wisdom has given me health indeed. Combining knowledge with the Law of the Lord, the command of stewardship of the Earth and of our holy temple, has led me to eat organic food and use sustainable products. This will lead to a healthier body, saving costs in medicine and energy.
My bones, these are probably my insides and everything I am passionate about. My passions, whatever they were, are replaced by sustainable ones. Cooking and consuming organic food and wine is fun and of a much higher quality.

But even in reading books and watching movies and series my life can change. When I choose to watch only clean movies and series, my mind becomes clean as well and I am less consumed by sin and temptations.

In the Dutch Statenvertaling this is translated as

*Het zal een medicijn voor uw navel zijn, en een bevochtiging voor uw* *beenderen*

The navel is the part where the body is fed. If medicine is fed there, the whole body is fed. But note that it says *medicine* and not health. Health can indicate that you can *stay* healthy, that is, you already were healthy. But medicine always means you were not healthy to begin with.

The moisturizing of one's bones I probably can only understand when I am old, but it probably refers to the feeling old people have when standing or waking up and hearing their bones crackle.
*Oh how good does it feel to not is feeling anymore. It is like a massage for sore muscles or a visit to the chiropractor when bones need to be set.*

*Honor the Lord with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops; then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine.*
*Proverbs 3:9-10 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.3.9-10.NIV*

Indeed, I am wealthy. I have luxury food and wine in my house. Computers and technical gadgets others have never heard about, and I have a great house where it is warm and dry.
I can go by with much less. I only need to put myself aside, put my worries aside, and let You take control, because You can give me so much more.

*Vereer den HEERE van uw goed, en van de eerstelingen al uwer inkomsten; Zo zullen uw schuren met overvloed vervuld worden, en uw perskuipen van most overlopen.*

*New wine are the pressed grapes before fermentation.*

*My son, do not despise the Lord ’s discipline, and do not resent his rebuke,*
*because the Lord disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in.*
*Proverbs 3:11-12 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.3.11-12.NIV*

I should not despise the Lord's discipline. If the Lord disciplines me, it is always for a good reason, for I have done something wrong, and it is to teach me not to do it anymore, and it gives me more freedom from sin when I obey.
As much as I hate to be rebuked by men, for it means they know it better than I do *and* I have done something wrong, I do not mind, or mind much less, when God rebukes me. I can accept his rebuke for I have already accepted that He is more powerful than I am. But the same thing does not apply for men and women in my surrounding. I still have trouble accepting their rebukes.
But one thing I should know is that rebuke comes out of love. For if I feel I am loved and that this rebuke is done out of love, then I am much more willing to accept this rebuke.
I think this is what I know of God already, that He loves me and delights in me. I just have to find out about this in other people.

*Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding,*
*for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold.*

The return spoken of here, I am not sure if this a paraphrase of the original text but it sure is meaningful. I am wondering as well whether *profitability* and *returns* have the same meaning.

In the Dutch Statenvertaling we read the following.

**Want haar koophandel is beter dan de koophandel van zilver, en haar inkomst dan het uitgegraven goud.**

TODO OPZOEKEN
Koophandel means merchandise or trading value?
I am not sure about that but it does not say gold per se, but raw gold. Because whether you have raw or minted gold, the value of that does not differ very much. The value of raw gold is immediately worth almost as much as refined and minted gold.
So if I have wisdom, that can be sharpened a bit with some knowledge and experience, but wisdom in itself almost has the same intrinsic value as someone with experience who uses it.

*She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her.*

Rubies are famous and attractive for their color and shape. But wisdom is even more attractive, so attractive that nothing can even compare with her. It is on a totally different scale. Like gold cannot be compared with diamonds. Or diamonds and crystal, where crystal has no intrinsic value at all.

*Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.*

Coincidentally, two out of three gods in Chinese culture that stand for the things one should strive or long for, are longevity and riches. And both are obtained by wisdom!
Interestingly, honor is not part of Asian culture, and no matter how national-socialistic the country of China may be at the moment, its roots show that the Chinese are materialistic.

*Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace.*

One thing I can be sure of is that wisdom always leads to peace. Whereas wealth and status may lead to jealousy and corruption or even greed, and perhaps the same for honor and no real disadvantages for longevity, except for the reason that longevity has no purpose in itself but for what is done with the time he is assigned, wisdom always leads to peace.
It was the knowledge of Jesus Christ that was higher than that of the Pharisees, and their status or authority was undermined, as well as he awe of the people, but it was not the wisdom of Jesus Christ that led to their anger. Rather, it was wisdom that led Jesus to know how to deal with their rage and jealousy, sometimes by walking away, and sometimes indeed, confronting it, but never unknowingly.

*She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her; those who hold her fast will be blessed.*
*Proverbs 3:13-18 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.3.13-18.NIV*

Wisdom will give me life. I have experienced that in multiple ways. It has saved my life from being grabbed by sin, it has prevented me from mistakes that would turn my life around. Even though I do not see all things that wisdom has done for me, and inherently what God has done, I know I owe my life to it.

*By wisdom the Lord laid the earth’s foundations, by understanding he set the heavens in place; by his knowledge the watery depths were divided, and the clouds let drop the dew.*
*Proverbs 3:19-20 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.3.19-20.NIV*

Knowledge here is not the knowledge we normally speak of. Rather it means "to my knowing". God has knowledge of everything that happens, he knows about it.
The word for *understanding* here is the same word for *wisdom* as in the previous verses.
It is strange to see that wisdom has anything to do with laying the Earth's foundation, because wisdom is doing the right thing at the right time. But it is exactly that, which makes proof of a great Designer Who designed and created the Earth, specifically minding every detail and every nanosecond of creation, until the very degree and size of our planet and the distance to the sun, instead of a Big Bang occurring out of nothing and creating an Earth out of pure randomness.

*My son, do not let wisdom and understanding out of your sight, preserve sound judgment and discretion;*
*they will be life for you, an ornament to grace your neck.*

The best advice a father can give to his son is to never let go of wisdom and *thoughtfulness* (in the Dutch translation), the latter being (I think) a moment of waiting before saying something, to let the wisdom of God take over and not your own.
As mentioned before, they will save your life. Sometimes literally, if you are standing in front of people who want to kill you, but at other times they will prevent you from making a mistake for which you will suffer the rest of your life.

*Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble.*
*When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.*

The best thing any person can get is a good sleep. At the same time the worst thing is a bad sleep, because that will influence every part of your life, your physique, your mental capacity, your patience and character eventually and even your health.
When we are afraid or paranoid we have bad sleep. Fear of money troubles, school, relational issues. Fear affects everything and that is because it is the opposite of love.
Love does the opposite of all of the above. It soothes and fills our lives with satisfaction and let us sleep well. That is because we are made out of love.

*Have no fear of sudden disaster or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked, for the Lord will be at your side and will keep your foot from being snared.*
*Proverbs 3:21-26 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.3.21-26.NIV*

Whatever happens with others, I do not have to fear that, for I know the Lord is with me. And why is the latter so important? If the Lord is by my side, my foot will not be snared. Not only by my enemies, but also by my own foolish actions.

*27 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,*
*when it is in your power to act.*
*28 Do not say to your neighbor,*
*“Come back tomorrow and I’ll give it to you”—*
*when you already have it with you.*

Help me to know the balance of giving good to people to whom it is due. Many of them are due good indeed, but I cannot give all I have to them, for nothing would remain for myself. And of course I cannot give more than I have. But this reminds me of a story by Rees Howells who gave all he had and trusted You to provide if he obeyed You.
Lord, teach me to be obedient like him and even more like You were, Lord Jesus.

*29 Do not plot harm against your neighbor,*
*who lives trustfully near you.*

We are not to plot harm against anyone, but we might be tempted to do so, if it is easy. Our neighbor, who is unaware, can easily be fooled by us. Even if our neighbor deserves harm, we are not to do so, because he trusted us.
This is why I had so much resistance within myself to plot harm against my construction worker. He fooled us, so we fooled him back. But all the time he was trusting us to be truthful and being Christians.
While we were truthful all the time, we did plot to not pay him, of course because the net calculation was in our favor. But it still did not feel good, and now I know why.

*30 Do not accuse anyone for no reason—*
*when they have done you no harm.*

Also, even if people are wrong about me, I should not accuse them when they have done me no harm.

*31 Do not envy the violent*
*or choose any of their ways.*

The question is what violence is. Is that any form of martial arts? Or is it the usage thereof in wrongful situations?
Most important, however, is not to envy them. What do they get with violence? They get righteousness, they get what they want at their time, they get revenge; but what do they not get? They do not get patience, forgiveness, the ability to show mercy (to their enemy) or live out of grace (from You).

*For the Lord detests the perverse but takes the upright into his confidence.*

Why should I not envy the violent or the wicked? They have all but God's blessing, rather yet, God detests them. It is not the world that is important, it is to be on God's side.

*The Lord ’s curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous.*
*He mocks proud mockers but shows favor to the humble and oppressed.*
*The wise inherit honor, but fools get only shame.*
*Proverbs 3:32-35 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.3.32-35.NIV*

In everything we see that we praise and honor from God if we follow His rules, and the fools only get shame. He rewards the upright, the righteous, the humble and oppressed.
Now being oppressed is not really a characteristic trait, but it probably comes forth out of the circumstances. A person who is humble easily gets oppressed, and the wicked would rather oppress a righteous than their fellow wicked ones.
Lastly, being oppressed could also be a trait of gentleness, for the not gentle person would strike back.
