# Proverbs 15
*A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.*
 
 
How convenient that this verse should cross my eyes at the exact same time a memory and thought crossed my mind.
The memory concerned that of my last working day at Staples, where my manager was unhappy with finding out I was still home at 10 AM, because I still had some personal things to do and as an excuse said I was compensating with overwork time.
Afterwards I sent a mail to her saying I would compensate with my holidays and make sure all knowledge transfer would be finished, and even propose to help them after my contract had ended.
She immediately became a bit calmer, as far as I could tell from an e-mail, but I clearly sensed that she was still on the edge of
*.. Some more explanation about the situation*
Thinking afterwards, I might have been more tough, like my current employer, but as this verse says, that would probably only stir up anger.
 
 
*The tongue of the wise adorns knowledge, but the mouth of the fool gushes folly.*
 
 
Once again I am totally sure that I wrote something here, but it probably was removed because I did not have my Internet on. I will consider this an act of God, in order to rethink what I wrote and to see whether it was correct, or that I needed that verse not yesterday but today. 
What I wrote was that what people say fits their intelligence and wisdom. The other way around is not always true. Someone who says wise words is not a wise person per se, but a wise person always has wise words adorning him, like a rich man has jewels adorning him (although that is a bad analogy, because he can decide not to wear them).
The foolish people on the other hand causes sin and strife.
Thinking about this right now, I wrote a letter, not having sent it out, for it seemed wise to me to let someone else check it first. But it seems like, even though I tried to write it objectively and mild, it will still cause them to have a very negative image of me, but most of all, it would not change them or let them know they were wrong.

*The eyes of the Lord are everywhere, keeping watch on the wicked and the good.*
 
 
The Lord watches, but also watches over the wicked and the good. This means he takes care of the wicked as well.
 
 
*The soothing tongue is a tree of life, but a perverse tongue crushes the spirit.*
 
Lord, forgive me, for my tongue is definitely not soothing. It is crushing some spirits and not to the least of them, namely my spouse.
I cannot control my mood, Lord, no matter how hard I try to.
I am weak, but You are strong. I ask You for Your strength, not so that I can brag, but so that I can see Your strength in me and so that I may change.
 
 
*A fool spurns a parent’s discipline, but whoever heeds correction shows prudence.*
 
 
Of course I would always say to heed correction, but that is easier said than done. Especially when my ego is involved.
 
 
*The house of the righteous contains great treasure, but the income of the wicked brings ruin.*
 
 
What would be meant with the house? Would it mean that inside that house one would be blessed? Or that many treasures can be found there?
As for the latter, I suppose not material treasuries, but one could see how the husband treats his wife and how she submits to him. How children obey their parents and follow the lead of the Lord.
But the wicked have an income that bring ruin. This too must not be taken literally, I think. It probably means that every month the wicked receive more bad news.
I had a friend who almost never had a month where he did not get bad news. Of course that happens when you have been building up a long record of unrighteous things. Debts are one thing, but the reputation as well. Things like not being able to get a job, and sudden bills to pay for crimes committed in the past, those are the things a (former) criminal receives every day or week. No rest is left for him, no family or friends. He succeeds in nothing, not even in changing his life.
 
 
*The lips of the wise spread knowledge, but the hearts of fools are not upright.*
 
 
Once again I am intrigued by the use of the word *but* because I do not see a direct relation between spreading knowledge and being upright. 
I would say that one either spreads knowledge or one does not, but even in not spreading knowledge one's heart can be upright.
But rethinking this, if everything one says is the truth, there should be some knowledge in it – if only factual knowledge.
Another way of interpreting this, is by presuming that every heart that is upright, is giving some knowledge to another when speaking. A righteous person either wants to know another person, teach him or let himself be known. Only a person with a not upright heart, or for that matter a *fool,* will not have any wisdom coming from his lips. 

In that sense one can even make a relation between a fool and a righteous person. What makes someone a fool? A person who has the choice of doing something righteous, but chooses not to.
 
 
*The Lord detests the sacrifice of the wicked, but the prayer of the upright pleases him.*
 
 
What would the Lord think of my prayers. Would he accept it when I have sinned badly? Would it please him?
I cannot say I am upright, at least it does not feel that way, right after I have sinned.
 
 
*The Lord detests the way of the wicked, but he loves those who pursue righteousness.*
 
 
Can I even say I am *pursuing* righteousness? It is more like I am trying to avoid wickedness.
 
 
*Stern discipline awaits anyone who leaves the path; the one who hates correction will die.*
 
 
What happens with those who hate correction perhaps is even worse than death. They will regret what they have done, see their children en and grandchildren make the same mistakes they have done and not begin able to do anything about it.
They will physically suffer from it as well, all the abuse of alcohol, cigarettes and unhealthy food leads them to have high blood pressure and problems breathing.
Now if they are 50 and problems start arising, and knowing that they will probably live up to 70, they know they will have another twenty years of suffering. In that sense, death would be more like a reward than a punishment, although what comes after death would be worse than anything else.
But those who are willing to change, it will not be easy for them either, but it will have far better results than choosing not listen to God. Stern discipline awaits them, for those who leave the path *but* wants to go back on it. 
 
 
*Death and Destruction lie open before the Lord — how much more do human hearts!*
*Proverbs 15:1‭-‬11 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.15.1-11.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.15.1-11.NIV)*
 
 
I was hoping for a verse that is related to what happened this morning, but it is God Who decides what to give me and what is more important. As for this morning, I guess I already know the answer. Keep the peace, do not attack anyone or walk out in peace maintaining my gentleness, for which I have received the power of the Holy Spirit.
What this verse is saying, is that something as large and powerful as death and destruction, personified through be it mythical creatures or the devil himself, are fully known by God. So how can God not know us lowly life creatures fully and even more than that?
Of course there is nothing more than full, but we have to know that God knows *everything* about us. 
Everything that is ugly as well.
 
 
*Mockers resent correction, so they avoid the wise.*
 
 
This is a good thing to know when someone is avoiding you and you have a conflict with them, although it could also be that he wants to avoid this conflict and keep the peace.
 
 
*A happy heart makes the face cheerful, but heartache crushes the spirit.*
 
 
Do not let your mood be influenced by your surroundings, because heartache will go deeper than the face, it will crush your spirit. Stay happy therefore in order to save your spirit.
 
 
*The discerning heart seeks knowledge, but the mouth of a fool feeds on folly.*
 
 
A wise person tries to discern between what is wisdom and what is not. In case it is not wisdom, he keeps his mouth shut. But the fool takes everything he can say, perhaps just to be interesting or to attract attention, even folly.
 
 
*All the days of the oppressed are wretched, but the cheerful heart has a continual feast.*
 
 
It seems like I am the oppressed one, although "all the days" would be am exaggeration. On the other hand, I do not know anyone who has a continual feast. I can imagine someone having good a feast for a while, even when one is persecuted.

*Better a little with the fear of the Lord than great wealth with turmoil.*
 
 
Having anything with the fear of the Lord, is always better, even if there is no turmoil in life.

*Better a small serving of vegetables with love than a fattened calf with hatred.*
 
 
As for receiving, do not be deceived by looks and value, for it is the intent with which something is given, and the person who it gives.
 
 
*A hot-tempered person stirs up conflict, but the one who is patient calms a quarrel.*
 
 
This certainly has to do with my current situation, but I am not sure if I can say if my spouse was stirring up the conflict or if I was not patient enough, which resulted in the quarrel.
 
 
*The way of the sluggard is blocked with thorns, but the path of the upright is a highway.*
 
 
Once again a rather strange correlation is brought between being upright and something else, namely sloth. But it is true, for an upright person would not leave sometime if he can in fact do it.
What does this have to do with being upright, which is honesty, you might think.
Suppose a room is dirty and unordered, a person will get trouble as a cause of that, eventually. When he cannot find his things for an important meeting or he loses something borrowed from someone else, he will realize that what he does could be prevented and could have helped others. The upright person will want to help others.
For those who are lazy reaching the goal is very difficult, but those who are upright will reach their goal either very fast or fast and without much trouble.
 
 
*A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish man despises his mother.*
*Proverbs 15:12‭-‬20 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.15.12-20.NIV*
 
 
Would a father enjoy joy more than a mother would enjoy respect (as opposed to despise)?
Wisdom will however give the man a fine reputation, of which the father will be proud, will foolishness will cause pain to his mother mostly.

*Folly brings joy to one who has no sense, but whoever has understanding keeps a straight course.*
 
 
Those who have no sense enjoy foolishness, like I have done at times. But real pleasure is found in keeping a straight course.
 
 
*Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed.*
 
 
When someone has a plan, it may fail when he himself does not have enough knowledge and he does not ask anyone else for it either. But when there are many advisers, and this person has wisdom to obtain the right advice, then he will succeed, even if succeeding means not to go through with his plan.
 
 
*A person finds joy in giving an apt reply— and how good is a timely word!*
 
 
Whenever I cannot give an apt reply, it must be because I do not know the answer or do not want to give, because something is shameful about it.
But for the person who asks it is of delight when someone answers quickly as well.
 
 
*The path of life leads upward for the prudent to keep them from going down to the realm of the dead.*
 
 
God takes care of us even in providing our path. He makes sure the path leads in the right direction. All we need to be is prudent, be tempered and wise about our decisions, and then the way we go will automatically be the right way.
 
 
*The Lord tears down the house of the proud, but he sets the widow’s boundary stones in place.*
 
 
Lord, if You are talking about me, then please let me know. In what way am I proud? Am I thinking perhaps that I know everything and that I have done everything right, I while I have not?
Please take care of Sandra, Lord. Let her recover and let our marriage recover. Let everything I have done in hurting her be recovered by my You.
Set her stones in place, her boundary stones, so that she will know and let me know what her boundaries and limits are. When she can handle and when she can not handle by herself and needs my help.
She needs to realize that, but I cannot tell her.
 
 
*The Lord detests the thoughts of the wicked, but gracious words are pure in his sight.*
 
 
Wicked people only think of themselves, their own benefits, no matter how many other people are being disadvantaged as a cause of this.
Pure-hearted people think of the advantage for others, even if they themselves do not gain out of it.
The work of the gracious might be annulled by the work of the wicked. But by God’s grace the good always conquers the bad.

*The greedy bring ruin to their households, but the one who hates bribes will live.*
 
 
The greedy might think they will receive more money, and even though they think money will bring satisfaction and happiness to their life but it will bring ruin instead. It will bring ruin to the marriage, for the man is so obsessed with money that he spends all his time on it, and to the children for they do not learn how to work hard for money or get disgusted by it because their father was never willing to give them any, or because they see how it has wrecked their parents' lives.
 
 
 
 
*The heart of the righteous weighs its answers, but the mouth of the wicked gushes evil.*
 
 
A righteous person does not always know whether what he says is true or wise. Weighing it will prevent him from less mistakes.
 
 
*The Lord is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous.*
 
 
The wicked might feel that the Lord is not listening to them, but the the truth is, He hears them but is not willing to answer them for God has answered them enough in these verses. As long as their wicked behavior continues, God will be far from them, but as soon as they admit their faults, repent and call to God, God will hear them.
 
 
*Light in a messenger’s eyes brings joy to the heart, and good news gives health to the bones.*
 
 
Just like disease in one's bones was mentioned in a previous chapter, and as I had mentioned it as the worst of all pains, so health in one's bones exists as well when one receives good news.
It is a different feeling from staying healthy, good news is like thinking of having cancer and then waiting for the result and hearing that you do not have it. Or like waiting for your exam results to know whether you have passed or not.
And the messenger, how innocent he may be, will be the symbol of joy when he brings good news and of sadness when he brings bad news.
 
 
*Whoever heeds life-giving correction will be at home among the wise.*
 
 
This is not merely about corrections, it is about life-giving corrections. These type of corrections might give life, but they will change your life and ask you to change your life as well, in order for you to preserve your life.
 
 
*Those who disregard discipline despise themselves, but the one who heeds correction gains understanding.*
 
 
In fact, those who disregard discipline are only not doing themselves a favor. The person who disciplines them finds no delight in punishing them, and they are causing themselves to become a menace to society, so only hurting others in the long run.

*Wisdom’s instruction is to fear the Lord , and humility comes before honor.*
*Proverbs 15:21‭-‬33 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.15.21-33.NIV*
 
 
Fearing the Lord comes first in every situation. When a human being is so foolish as to neglect the Lord's wisdom, and think that he know better himself, I have no words for that. Not that I do not know what this is called in the dictionary, but more that I have nothing to say anymore.
A rhetorical question could be asked to this person not fearing God, *do you think you know better than God?* If a person answer *yes* then there is nothing to say to this person anymore. But even if he says *no* and acts with a *yes* then the same applies.
