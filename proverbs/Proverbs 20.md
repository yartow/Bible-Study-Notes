# Proverbs 20
*Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler; whoever is led astray by them is not wise.*
 
 
Do not believe a person who is led by alcohol, he does not even know it himself, but he is prone to lying. The urge for alcohol is so strong and that he will do anything to get it.
If he were to tell the truth, he would not be allowed to drink anymore. Therefore he will not tell anyone about his problem.
He may not have planned to lie, but when it comes to it and he needs to choose between his relationships and alcohol, he will choose the latter.
Even for non alcoholics, however, alcohol changes the mind of people. Never engage in a serious conversation or action, like sexual interaction with someone, when both of you are not sober.
 
 
*A king’s wrath strikes terror like the roar of a lion; those who anger him forfeit their lives.*
 
 
Antagonizing God is like teasing a lion. I cannot see how people know the danger of antagonizing a lion or a dictator, and see that they are going to die, and could be punished far more than they deserve, but not see the power of the One Who created this lion and put this dictator or king into this position.
The great King is God Himself Who not only has power of your life here, whether you live or die, but also about everything *during* your life, whoever you meet and what your decisions are. 
He even has power over the life you have *after* your life on Earth. 
If there is anyone you should fear it is the Lord of lords, God Almighty, Who thrones in heaven and uses the Earth as His footstool for His holy feet.
 
 
*It is to one’s honor to avoid strife, but every fool is quick to quarrel.*
*Proverbs 20:1‭-‬3 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.20.1-3.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.20.1-3.NIV)*
 
 
Yesterday I read this wrong. It is a good thing I did not have time to write about this, otherwise I would have understood this in a wrong way.
I thought it was good to strife, as long as you do not give in to quarrel with others. As long as you strife for the right causes it is ok. But I read it wrong. It is not good to strife and it is better to avoid strife.

*Sluggards do not plow in season; so at harvest time they look but find nothing.*
 
 
This time it is not the fools or he lazy ones who find themselves in trouble, but the slow ones, he sluggish ones. They are lazy, but on top of that they are slow to act as well. Sometimes so slow they are dying of starvation because they eat and digest too slow.
For these animals I really have not found any reason to live. Sloths do not eat leftover leaves and clean up nature. They do not look pretty nor have any amazing features. You cannot eat them or use their skin.
God must have had an intention in creating them, but I cannot think of one.
The same so with people who are like sluggards. I cannot see any reason why they should stay in society. At least sluggards do not harm nature or other animals. Human sluggards infect others however and can mess up society and order. They can be the reason why people die if they did not act fast enough.
 
 
*The purposes of a person’s heart are deep waters, but one who has insight draws them out.*
 
 
Whenever you deal with someone, always try to find out what his heart's purposes are. Then anything they ask of you will be into the light of that and you will deal with him more carefully.
 
 
*Many claim to have unfailing love, but a faithful person who can find?*
*Proverbs 20:4‭-‬6 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.20.4-6.NIV*

Many people say they love you, unconditionally, forever and will always be there for you, but which one of them really faithful? Who will stay with you even through the storms of your life? Or better said, who will be your friend if they have a storm in their own life?
 
 
*The righteous lead blameless lives; blessed are their children after them.*
 
 
As mentioned before blameless here does not mean someone is perfect, but someone whom you cannot blame for anything. He does not have an affair, he has not deliberately made decisions that hurt others. Anything error you can mention of him is merely a human error for which he has honestly and humbly asked forgiveness
 
 
*When a king sits on his throne to judge, he winnows out all evil with his eyes.*
 
 
*I* am not sure what this means. Does this mean that an honest and fair king who is judging winnows all evil and looks at the person as if he is neutral? 
I understand there must be some objectivity in judging people, but evil and good are not part of subjectivity. They must be in the equation when judging a person, not windowed out.
 
 
*Who can say, “I have kept my heart pure; I am clean and without sin”?*
*Proverbs 20:7‭-‬9 NIV*

*[http://bible.com/111/pro.20.7-9.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.20.7-9.NIV)*
 
 
No one can say that.

*Differing weights and differing measures— the Lord detests them both.*
 
 
Whether you are in business selling stuff using weights, or judging people as a school administrator allowing applicants to your school or not, God detests it when you do not use equal measures.
I assume God has an opinion about affirmative action as well. I cannot speak for God's opinion in such a difficult matter.
 
 
*Even small children are known by their actions, so is their conduct really pure and upright?*
 
 
God knows that children are influenced by others, but even when nothing bad has been taught them, they still have sinful actions and desires.
 
 
*Ears that hear and eyes that see— the Lord has made them both.*
 
 
Whatever you observe through your eyes and ears, it is all a gift from the Lord. The Lord has given you a wonderful which would need tens or hundreds of books to fully explain how it works.
The eye does not only see, it also sends information to the brain to know whether we need to sleep, by the color of the light for example.

Give example of Flux software.

The eye can make beautiful "pictures" in the dark, while a modern camera cannot even come close to that.

Show pictures of beach here.

And the ears hear and have a great dynamic range, just like the eye. You can hear whispers and loud rock music.
But your ears help you to stay balanced as well. They also help you fall asleep faster through the balancing mechanics.

*Do not love sleep or you will grow poor; stay awake and you will have food to spare.*
*Eccles. 20:10‭-‬13 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.20.10-13.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.20.10-13.NIV)*

It says, Do not *love* sleep. In other words, a reminder of what has been said before. Do not be lazy.

*“Itʼs no good, itʼs no good!” says the buyer— then goes off and boasts about the purchase.*
 
 
This verse shows that crookedness has existed for as long as humanity. Even now we see this strategy and misleading selling strategies. Selling worthless products, while not having the consumer in mind but only one's own pockets.

Example. ZPMC cranes with half a meter of space between machinist and walking bordes.
 
 
*Gold there is, and rubies in abundance, but lips that speak knowledge are a rare jewel.*
 
 
People with real knowledge are rare. Even if we think the number of intelligent people is low, and of highly intelligent people, such as doctors and professors, is even lower, even they do not have anything intelligible to say when it comes to knowledge.
They think they are reasoning rationally, but they are leaving aside facts just because they do not fit their models.
People who seem really friendly and intelligent say the most crazy stuff when it comes to religion, just because they do not believe it.
The problem with these professors and their lack of knowledge is their morals. Because of their own morals they think our God is rude and therefore do not want to believe in Him.
But it is because of their morals that they do not have any knowledge. They allow killing babies through abortion and elderly through euthanasia, because of the freedom of the individual. According to their morals their liberty has a higher place the lives of others. How can this be knowledge?
According to their morals people have the right to marry anyone they want and this cannot be prevented by discrimination laws. But what if someone wants to marry an underaged person and they both consent?
There is no higher moral than theirs alone.
 
 
*Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger; hold it in pledge if it is done for an outsider.*
*Proverbs 20:14‭-‬16 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.20.14-16.NIV*

If someone is willing to back up another person whom he does not even know well, then this person needs to have a ransom as well.
I cannot and should not trust the word of someone who is foolish enough to trust a stranger and even stand ransom for him.

Food gained by fraud tastes sweet, but one ends up with a mouth full of gravel.

In the beginning the things you want so badly seem satisfying, but after having it, you realize they are not as satisfying you thought they would be. There is still an urge for more, you see other things in your life that need to be fixed.
This is what happens when we fix our eyes on material things and even immaterial things, such as a girlfriend, if you think that will fix your life.
Now imagine that this thing you really wanted was obtained not by honest means, but by fraud. Now you are regretting two things. You did not get the satisfaction you wanted and you have committed a crime.
Do not be a fool and think you can *easily* get what you want, you can get away with crime or that there is anything on this world that can satisfy your deepest needs. 

*Plans are established by seeking advice; so if you wage war, obtain guidance.*

This verse is not saying that it is bad to go to war. It is not saying it is good either, but it is saying that we should obtain guidance when we make plans. Going to war requires a plan, getting children requires a plan.
There are so many things in life we do not see as requiring a plan, but they do. Seeing that is a part of wisdom.

*A gossip betrays a confidence; so avoid anyone who talks too much.*
*Proverbs 20:17‭-‬19 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.20.17-19.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.20.17-19.NIV)*

Do not think you have found your ideal talking partner, someone who is willing to listens to you and tells you a lot about what he has been through. You never know if this person will keep what you have told him to himself. Especially when he talks too much, he might do that about you as well.

*If someone curses their father or mother, their lamp will be snuffed out in pitch darkness.*
 
 
I understand that this is true for good parents and irresponsible children. Children often do not understand the hardships their parents have been through to raise them, and how much love they have given for them to be happy. If a child then cursus his parents this will break the hearts of the parents and it is only righteous that their lights gets snuffed out.
But what about those parents who have done nothing good for their children, except for giving them birth, which was not even by choice? What will the punishment be of a child who curses them for what they have done to him?
I do not know the answer.
 
 
*An inheritance claimed too soon will not be blessed at the end.*

 
 
God will give us things at the right time, because a good thing at the wrong time can be a bad thing.

We may have an inheritance in heaven, but it is not our time yet to go there and get it. We still need to be formed, our character needs to grow.
So if your character has not fully been formed yet, you will not fully receive or enjoy your inheritance. Why would you have the pleasure of your inheritance decreased while you can have the full pleasure a little later? There is only reason, because of impatience.
Take for example a car. You get this car as your inheritance, but only as soon as you have obtained your driver's license. If you do not have your license yet, or do not know how to drive – which are two different things by the way – you will not fully enjoy the car. You might not even enjoy the car at all anymore if you have wrecked it. But on a lesser scale, you might not enjoy the car when driving either, because everything seems a lot scarier and you are afraid of getting accidents.

TODO
Compare the above example with another one. I was anxious when driving when it was not my car, but as soon as it was my car (and as soon as I realized it was only material) I was much more relaxed when driving.
 
 

*Do not say, “Iʼll pay you back for this wrong!” Wait for the Lord , and he will avenge you.*
*Proverbs 20:20‭-‬22 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.20.20-22.NIV*

 
 
Once again, impatience plays an important role here. But more than just impatience it is trust in the Lord that is the key here. Trusting that (1) God will repay; (2) God will repay him what he *deserves*; (3) God will repay in His time. 
Also, though it does not say here, God will comfort you.

*The Lord detests differing weights, and dishonest scales do not please him.*
 
 
Either this is so important that this needs to be repeated at least three times in Proverbs or there are different authors in these last chapters. The latter seems less likely in this section, so I guess it other first.
Lord help me to be honest with everyone and not discriminate between people, especially not based on outer appearance
 
 
*A personʼs steps are directed by the Lord . How then can anyone understand their own way?*
 
 
Every step you take on the path of the Lord has been carefully thought through by Him Who knows the future. You do not even understand these steps while these steps are perfect. They contain no contingencies.
How can you then understand your own steps? You might understand why you have chosen to take your path, but you do not know where your way will lead to.

 
 
*It is a trap to dedicate something rashly and only later to consider oneʼs vows.*
*Eccles. 20:23‭-‬25 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.20.23-25.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.20.23-25.NIV)*

The explanation of the previous verse applies here as well. If only we know our own steps then we would not dedicate ourselves to something we later on regret in life.
But dedicating ourselves to something rashly is even worse than that. You do not need to know the future, you can never decide something rashly.

Lord, help me that when I get an offer I cannot resist to not decide rashly as I have learned here. Let me make all decisions together with You, to be led by You alone and to obtain all wisdom and power needed to make these decisions, no matter how small.

*A wise king winnows out the wicked; he drives the threshing wheel over them.*
 
 
Note that it says a *wise* king, which means that not every king does this this, but should do it. Presidents alike are obliged to do so, but do not, as we have seen in America, where Bill Clinton exonerated a criminal without a cause and then later in profited from him through generous donations. 
A wise king, not just a *ruler* because even though everyone should do so, not everyone has the right to execute, but only the king, will also drive the threshing wheel over them, which means to execute a punishment so severe that it should scare off the wicked. 
 
 
*The human spirit is the lamp of the Lord that sheds light on oneʼs inmost being.*
 
 
The *human spirit* is also translated as *what comes out of one's mouth*. It is the mouth that shows us our most inmost being if not our minds. 
Can we then say that God uses our spirit to let us know what we really are on the inside? I do not understand what is the difference between the spirit and the inmost being. I thought these were the same. But if they are not, I can only guess what functions each of them has.
The spirit most likely is that which is connected to the Lord. It is through the spirit that we can understand the concept of God. But I am mixing the words *soul* and *spirit* right now, because our *inmost being* probably refers to our soul. That what allows us to think, though not our morality, because that is in our spirit. 

*Love and faithfulness keep a king safe; through love his throne is made secure.*
*Eccles. 20:26‭-‬28 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.20.26-28.NIV*

Even a king has his weak points and that is that needs the support of people. Without it he may be overthrown, whatever the law may say.
Thus a king too must make sure that he is loved by his people and faithful to his people. In the same way his people will be faithful to him and love him.

*The glory of young men is their strength, gray hair the splendor of the old.*
 
 
Young Men should use what they are good and and acknowledge what they are not the best at. They should listen to the elders, while elders should not rely on their own strength but on that of the young.
 
 
*Blows and wounds scrub away evil, and beatings purge the inmost being.*
*Eccles. 20:29‭-‬30 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.20.29-30.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.20.29-30.NIV)*

I am sure this is not advising us to castigate ourselves. But perhaps the writer means this in a spiritual sense. We get many beatings as a Christian as a result of discrimination and misunderstanding.
People in India literally get beat up though because they believe in Jesus, but it only makes them stronger and believe more in Jesus Christ, because it only shows that the god of the Hindus and Muslims is not a peaceful god and that the God of the Christians is.
Sometimes we get emotional beatings as well, but these purge our inmost being for we realize we cannot depend on ourselves
