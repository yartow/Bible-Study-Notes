# Proverbs 23 – Sayings 17 - 19
***Saying 17***
*Listen to your father, who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old.*
*Buy the truth and do not sell it— wisdom, instruction and insight as well.*
*The father of a righteous child has great joy; a man who fathers a wise son rejoices in him.*
*May your father and mother rejoice; may she who gave you birth be joyful!*
Proverbs 23:17‭-‬25 NIV
[http://bible.com/111/pro.23.17-25.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.23.17-25.NIV)

This is one sin I am definitely guilty of, *do not despise your mother... When she is old.* I already did it before she was old, because of the lack of wisdom she had, while I failed to realize it was God Who gave me this wisdom. 
Listen to your father, perhaps is one thing I have neglected as well. I have not saved money in the way he advised. Perhaps I had no choice, but I did not follow his commands and did and do not respect them or him either.
Forgive me for this, Father, and and help me to ask forgiveness to my father as well.

*Buy the truth and do not sell it— wisdom, instruction and insight as well.*
 
 
Truth can be bought, in the form of education and books. But it can be sold as well. I do not mean by giving lectures, because that is multiplying and is actually good. But selling means you have lost it and someone has gained it.
I cannot really think of a way how one could lose the truth and let someone else gain it. Losing it perse is possible by drinking enough or using enough drugs amongst others. You will merely need to stray off of God's path long enough, and you will have forgotten the truth, as so many have.
Another way of forgetting the truth is by being indoctrinated or filled with the lie, that is, that God does not exist and that evolution is true, abortion and euthanasia (or palliative sedation for that matter) are freedom and gay marriages are fair and humane, etc.
As a side note, I would even add *hence* to the "does not exist and" part, because the rest of the sentence flows from the part where people have bought into the lie. One might argue that a lot of Catholics allow gay marriages and some protestant as well, but those churches have the wrong image of God and hence worship another God. I would say that they do not believe in God as He really is. 
That is about losing the truth. Gaining the truth is another thing. Good examples of those would probably be the Islam, who gained the truth from the Jews and Christians, and Jehova's Witnesses and the Latter Day Saints (Mormons), who clearly gained their message from Christians.
What these people are selling is not the truth, but for sure they have lost it. Some of the latter two sects heard the Truth, but lost it and now sell a different truth.
This is as close as I can get to interpreting this verse.

*The father of a righteous child has great joy; a man who fathers a wise son rejoices in him.*

 
 
The feeling is indescribable when your child grows up to be righteous. I know some parents would want their children to have become something else, but for normal parents to see the righteousness of children is a wonderful thing, because that means the parents have given at least one good thing to this world.
As said before, all I would need for my child to have, is wisdom, because I know he would then make the correct choices. I would rejoice in him if he uses and shows his wisdom, because then I know he has learned something.
 
 
*May your father and mother rejoice; may she who gave you birth be joyful!*

The wish is uttered for a father and mother to rejoice. I hope for every parent to be able to rejoice, or in other words, I hope every child will find wisdom.

***Saying 18***
*My son, give me your heart and let your eyes delight in my ways, for an adulterous woman is a deep pit, and a wayward wife is a narrow well.*
*Like a bandit she lies in wait and multiplies the unfaithful among men.*
*Proverbs 23:26‭-‬28 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.23.26-28.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.23.26-28.NIV)*
 
 
God the Father is talking to both me and my son here. It is another confirmation not to watch this TV series I saw yesterday, *Westworld.* The first confirmation came this morning right when I woke up: *do not watch what tempts you*. 
How foolish and weak I am to need another confirmation from God in order to be reminded. Most certainly one confirmation is not enough for someone as stubborn as me.
But it is necessary, because an adulterous woman is *like a deep pit*. If you fall into it, it is very hard to ever come out. *A wayward wife is like a narrow well,* sleeping with an adulterous woman is one thing, sleeping with someone else's wife is another. Of course, the word adulterous indicates the woman already has a boyfriend or husband, but in these days we could also define her as someone who sleeps around with people. In short, it not only takes a long time, but it is also very difficult to get out of this downward spiral of adultery. 
I have fallen into it once, because of my relationship with my first girlfriend Karina, who led me into a world of sex and adultery. Adulterous she was herself, and she contaged me with it, cause me to cheat on on my next girlfriend and sort of on every other girl coming after.
Even when I got married, the physical actions stopped, but mentally they continued. And now, after seven years of marriage, it slowly getting coming to rest. You can say I am at the top of the pit, seeing the light. A full 17 years it took me to recover from one adulterous woman. How long would it have taken me if there were more? How many have I not hurt and contaged myself?

*She lies in wait... multiplies the unfaithful.*. The multiplication and contagion I have already discussed. In this case the verse is speaking of linear growth while I was speaking of exponential growth. 
Fortunately, in every case I can think of, the ones I hurt have not become adulterous. Two of them might have become more sexual active (before their marriage, and they still have not married) because of me – both were virgins before they had met me – but none of them has become an adulterer like me.

I see now why certain women whom I really liked were not meant for me, even though I really liked them. God protected them... from me. At least in the case of some of them that is the case. Some of them might have really good relationships with their boyfriend or spouse, at least one has. I would have merely played with them and become bored eventually, for there has never been a girl I have not become bored with.

***Saying 19***
*Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?*
*Those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine.*
 
 
The people addicted to alcohol have all of the above. They have sorrow. They do not realize it, but it is the very reason they are drinking.
John Baker told us about his life story that there has always been something in the family people never talked about and which indirectly had impacted him, the death of an unborn brother.
He had to realize that this pain – perhaps ultimately – was the cause of his drinking, because it was this sorrow he could temporarily forget.
Al alcoholics are physically and mentally addicted. To find out what this sorrow is, exposes the reason for drinking. God can show this sorrow or you may have found out yourself, but God alone can take this sorrow away.
 
 
*Do not gaze at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly! In the end it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper.*
 
 
Just like wine looks better when it is old and fermented, that is red, most certainly all addictions look good and start with lots of benefits. Nicotine will you more concentration – or the thought of it, at least – so does caffeine, cocaine gives you energy on top of that as well and heroine gives you the highest amount of dopamine you have ever felt, higher than any orgasm.
But all of those work destructive for your body and brains, and the method of taking it destroys your skin when you are using needles, your lungs, mouth and teeth when using cigarettes and your nose when using cocaine.
I have forgotten to mention the addiction to sex. The above are all substance related, but porn or set addictions are the worst to your brains.
 
 
*Your eyes will see strange sights, and your mind will imagine confusing things. You will be like one sleeping on the high seas, lying on top of the rigging. “They hit me,” you will say, “but Iʼm not hurt! They beat me, but I donʼt feel it! When will I wake up so I can find another drink?”*
*Proverbs 23:29‭-‬35 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.23.29-35.NIV*

Confusion is one of the worst part of being an addict. Whereas with cocaine you know you have become stronger, and with alcohol you think you can handle the whole world, with a porn addiction you will think you can get any girl.
You can use substances without hurting anyone, but you cannot even watch porn without hurting someone.
The addiction will go on so heavily that you will never be satisfied, and in real life a sec addict would not be satisfied with his own wife and look for more elsewhere.
