# Proverbs 17
*Better a dry crust with peace and quiet than a house full of feasting, with strife.*
 
 
In life we can see at least two types of families, rich ones and poor ones. The rest is everything in between.
It is often portrayed in movies how poor families can work together and share a meal with peace and love. It is also possible of course to have poor families and have strife. But if we take the two extremes, poor and rich, and peace and strife, combined respectively, the conclusion of these movies always leads to the first one being the better. I guess the same goes for real life, when one had the choice.
Dickens portrayed this situation in his book *A Christmas carol* leading to the all-known resolution of Jesus’ words Himself: '*It is more blessed to give than to receive.*'
 
 
*A prudent servant will rule over a disgraceful son and will share the inheritance as one of the family.*
 
 
What you do is more important than you are. This is quite a controversial statement because in this time and age the world tells us that what is in the inside is important. This statement is based, however, on a different understanding, namely that heritage is less important than what one achieves in life.
Even though God tells us that our heritage is that we are His children and therefore we are saved, being a child of God already implies that we are hard working people.
For God this is what matters, independent of what your worldly heritage is, that we work hard through God's grace. Then we shall be rewarded as if we are of an important worldly heritage.
Grace is the key word here, and people like Joseph, Moses, but also farmer boys like Josh McDowell and immigrants like Dinesh D'Souza have reached a high status in the world
 
 
*The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but the Lord tests the heart.*
 
 
There are ways and persons fitted to test your gold and other variables, and perhaps they are strenuous and will destroy a part of it. Gold will lose about ten percent during smelting for example.
The Lord says in Jeremiah 17:10 that He Himself tests the heart and the mind and Who is fit more than He Who knows the inner beings of our heart (cf. Proverbs 15:11)?
The way He uses to test us is different for each but He promises never to let us tested beyond what we can bear (1 Corinthians 10:13).
 
 
*A wicked person listens to deceitful lips; a liar pays attention to a destructive tongue.*
 
 
Whether a lie has impact depends on the listener. Does he pay attention to it? If he is of good will, he will not, but if he is ill willing then, yes, he will pay attention and even spread it further.
 
 
*Whoever mocks the poor shows contempt for their Maker; whoever gloats over disaster will not go unpunished.*
 
 
Mocking or gloating over someone's downfall has everything to do with how you look at God, Who loves every person and is allowing a person to get hurt with pain in His heart. So when You are laughing, you are in fact laughing at God, as if you were laughing at the survivors of one who deceased.
 
*Children’s children are a crown to the aged, and parents are the pride of their children.*
 
 
Children by nature are indeed proud of their parents, or at least want to be. They see their parents as their heroes. Perhaps not because they believe they are the best, or perhaps they do think so, but mostly because they have a loving parent and they want this person they love to deserve the best, which is the title of being the best.
 
 
*Eloquent lips are unsuited to a godless fool— how much worse lying lips to a ruler!*
 
 
Just like eloquence does not belong to a godless fool, so much and even more do lying lips belong to a ruler.
The inverse relation is as follows. A fool speaking with eloquent words, is like a wise person speaking with uneloquent words like street language and slang. What would be worse than that? A ruler, who should be wise almost by definition, speaking in slang. And what is worse than that? A ruler who speaks with words worse than slang, namely lies.
A person like Bill and Hillary Clinton, rulers of more than a nation, almost a whole continent, not only lie, but lie about a lot of things, and are corrupt on top of that and support a party that makes the rich richer, keeps the criminals out of jail, sustain corruption in on a government level and suppress minorities.
To them all of the proverbs in this book apply.
 
 
*A bribe is seen as a charm by the one who gives it; they think success will come at every turn.*
 
 
And not by coincidence this next verse follows up on what I wrote above. Success has come at them so far, except for the extramarital affair of Bill Clinton, but it will end. I do not know when, but it will.
 
 
*Whoever would foster love covers over an offense, but whoever repeats the matter separates close friends.*
 
 
No matter how small something is which can be forgiven by friends, if one keeps repeating it, it will cause a separation between friends.
 
 
*A rebuke impresses a discerning person more than a hundred lashes a fool.*
 
 
When you rebuke someone and this person does not listen, it just means he is not a discerning person, assuming you are right. In this case, do not bother rebuking him, because he would probably need lashes before he understands.
 
 
*Evildoers foster rebellion against God; the messenger of death will be sent against them.*
 
 
In Old Testament times we actually see how a king executes those who rebel against God. This does not happen anymore, except in Islam and perhaps some other religions. However, in Islam they often use this rule for the wrong reason, that is to prosecute Christians.
As Christians we need to be aware that this rule still applies for us, especially because we know about this rule and because we know God and have seen Him.
Unfortunately a lot of people who call themselves Christian do not have this fear for the Lord (cf. Proverbs 9:10) that He so much desires.

*Better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool bent on folly.*
 
 
A bear might kill you, but a fool will first make your and other's lives miserable and then kill you.
 
 
*Evil will never leave the house of one who pays back evil for good.*
 
 
My parents in-law have been good to me, never done me any wrong. But I have not been a good son to them. I have not visited them regularly, paid them respect on celebrations or birthdays.
Rather yet, I have imposed restrictions on them on what to eat because it is healthy and looked down on them because they are, or seem, weak to me, which is what I hate.
But the Lord says here that evil will stay in my house this way. Even more so, I am ignoring one of the most important rules of God, which is not to oppress the poor and helpless (cf. Malachi 6:8 and Matthew 25).
 
 
*Starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam; so drop the matter before a dispute breaks out.*
*Proverbs 17:1‭-‬14 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.17.1-14.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.17.1-14.NIV)*

A good tip for me today. *Drop the matter.* I often have difficulties to drop things when I am too deep into things. 

*Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent— the Lord detests them both.*
 
 
On the other side of the spectrum of treating the elderly, parents and helpless, are the rich and the
 
 
*Why should fools have money in hand to buy wisdom, when they are not able to understand it?*
 
 
Rick Warren said about this verse that it is unwise to pay for your children's education if they are not willing to learn. This is kind of hard, because a lot of children in puberty do not like to study.
 
 
*A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity.*
 
 
A *real* friend, if I may add, then again, there is no such thing as a fake friend. So a real friend would always love you, independent of the circumstances. But what would the author mean by the brother part? Are brothers only helpful in times of adversity? 
TODO OPZOEKEN
 
 
*One who has no sense shakes hands in pledge and puts up security for a neighbor.*
 
 
Do not make deals, do not trust others when they say so. This is not to convict you, but to protect you. But in order to really prevent you from doing it, some pressure needs to be put on you. That is why in a similar verse, in a previous chapter of Proverbs, it is said that a ransom will be required from you.
 
 
*Whoever loves a quarrel loves sin; whoever builds a high gate invites destruction.*
 
 
I am not afraid of quarrels, but I have never thought I would be sinning when I loved it. Of course I knew, though, because keeping relationships peaceful is a command from God.
But let me put it like this, I am not afraid to get into a quarrel if that leads me to get a victory or win a discussion. But I do not *love* it, I had rather obtain my victory directly. 
As for the high gate, this proverb is probably pointing to people who think they are safe hiding behind their wall and cannot be punished or judged by God. I myself have a wall, not because I think I am safe for God's judgment behind it, but because I think I can protect my own self, not being hurt by others when I do not show my inner emotions and real thoughts.
 
 
*One whose heart is corrupt does not prosper; one whose tongue is perverse falls into trouble.*
 
 
It is both a matter of the heart and the mind. Even if I do not say corrupt things, my heart can still be corrupt and then still I will fall into trouble.
 
 
*To have a fool for a child brings grief; there is no joy for the parent of a godless fool.*
 
 
I understand a bit better now why You allow us to have children of our own. You are the great Father and Creator of all human and everything we live in. Your feelings are indescribable in words alone, You show us how You feel by giving us the same opportunity.
It takes such a long time for our children to grow up and become adults, just like it takes us humans such a long time before we spiritually mature. Even we, adults, are still reckless children in Your sight and even though we are disobedient, You still love us, like we still love our children when they are disobedient.
But still, having a fool for a child hurts us, even more than having one as a friend or brother.

*A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.*
 
 
It seems like the medicine to this grief would then be to have a cheerful heart. What could possibly give us that at these moments?
 
 
*The wicked accept bribes in secret to pervert the course of justice.*
 
 
Not money for sure, because that will pervert our hearts even more than it already is.
 
 
*A discerning person keeps wisdom in view, but a fool’s eyes wander to the ends of the earth.*
 
 
Hope for a new future is what keeps us at peace and able to give us joy as well. A fool however, would not be able to do so, because he can only look at what can be seen with the eyes.
As a response to the previous example of grieving parents for the foolishness of their child, staying wise will answer your questions and give you hope and joy for the future.
I have noticed that my joy is gone when I think that my father and brother will not be with you in Your Kingdom, but that is my flesh, looking only at human possibility. I know now that there is still hope. I am glad to know my brother still wants to have You present at His wedding. I wish it would be more than just His wedding and more than just receiving Your blessing. I wish He would want to have You in his life, instead of Your blessing only. But still, it is better than not wanting to have You or Your blessing.
He just does not realize that having Your presence and blessing means that cannot be combined with the presence of some other things, namely the things God does not like.
 
 
*A foolish son brings grief to his father and bitterness to the mother who bore him.*
 
 
This verse was repeated in a previous chapter, I think. The person who took care of him the most, his mother, will be bitter for it seems like all the love she has given him has ended up in a deep pit, never seeing anything back. It is not even that she wants this love returned so much as she wanted this love to feed him and protect him and now he is destroying himself. That is why she is bitter, as if someone has died.
Who can now convince her to love another child or person? If all you have given is gone, where do you get the hope and power to do it all again with the same risk? This is perhaps the same feeling some widows have
Not only to his father, but to his friends as well he will bring grief.
 
 
*If imposing a fine on the innocent is not good, surely to flog honest officials is not right.*
 
 
If we judge anyone, we are flogging them in a sense. Should we do that to those who are Christian, our brothers and sisters? Yes, but we should remember that the criminals outside of church are the ones who deserve it most.
Our brothers and sisters are in this sense even officials, ambassadors of God's kingdom.
So be mild when judging our fellow Christians.
 
 
*The one who has knowledge uses words with restraint, and whoever has understanding is even-tempered.*
 
 
Lord, please watch my mouth and let me use words with restraint. Let me not judge people with my mouth nor eyes, as well as in my thoughts. 

*Even fools are thought wise if they keep silent, and discerning if they hold their tongues.*
*Proverbs 17:15‭-‬28 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.17.15-28.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.17.15-28.NIV)*
 
 
Would this mean that even if I am a fool, I can be less foolish by acting not foolish? That would not solve any problem.
What would help, though, is that if fools do not say anything for in this way they would not be able to lead others astray.
