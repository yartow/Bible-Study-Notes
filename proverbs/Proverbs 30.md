# Proverbs 30
The sayings of Agur son of Jakeh—an inspired utterance. This manʼs utterance to Ithiel: “I am weary, God, but I can prevail.

Yes, I am weary as well, of this world and everything that is happening in it. Not only what is happening to me and my surroundings, but also to see what is going on in the rest of the world.
I am not sure what is meant by prevailing, I know the word, but I would not say that I prevail, for it is God Who prevails.

Surely I am only a brute, not a man; I do not have human understanding.

Yes compared to God's refinedness I am a brute. Compared to the standards that Jesus asks of me, I am a brute. And not only then, but even compared to some people I am like a brute.
Human understanding I lack a lot, but even the most considerate and empathetic person would be a brute compared to Jesus' understanding of humans.
None of us really know what it is that humans need. We do not even know what we need ourselves!

I have not learned wisdom, nor have I attained to the knowledge of the Holy One.

In this sense of extreme humility we can say we do not have learned any wisdom or knowledge at all. For with everything we do know from the Bible and have learned from sermons, we still do almost everything wrong.
Of course we know something, but do we do more good than bad? That is a question. In my opinion, if we had done much more good than bad, then a little bad would not corrupt the situation. But in practice, even if my marriage seems to be good, I only need a little discussion or fight and everything built up is broken to the ground. This means that what was built up, was not much or not steady to begin with.

Who has gone up to heaven and come down? Whose hands have gathered up the wind? Who has wrapped up the waters in a cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is the name of his son? Surely you know!
Proverbs 30:1‭-‬4 NIV
[http://bible.com/111/pro.30.1-4.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.30.1-4.NIV)

There is so much about God that we do not understand or are even able to imagine.
What is His name? Simply by knowing that it is God Who has done all of the above is giving Him honor. God he Father has ordered it, but God the Son, Jesus Christ, has done the work. So acknowledging the power of Jesus, that is giving Him honor and praise as well.

“Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. Do not add to his words, or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar.

Sometimes trying to make your point by adding to God's Word does more harm. In ways as such people have become disappointed by God's Word, thinking He has not kept His promises.

“Two things I ask of you, Lord ; do not refuse me before I die: Keep falsehood and lies far from me; give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread. Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you and say, ‘Who is the Lord ?’ Or I may become poor and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God.

I do not even know whether the latter is what we can ask of God. Of course we can ask Him for our daily bread, but it is not a right. Rather yet, I can imagine that sometimes God denies this from us, so that we can depend on Him even more and show our faith.
But it is a good thing what is being said here. No falsehood and no riches. These are two things we should avoid.

“Do not slander a servant to their master, or they will curse you, and you will pay for it.
Proverbs 30:5‭-‬10 NIV
[http://bible.com/111/pro.30.5-10NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.30.5-10NIV)

Though masters in this world are far from the biblical ideal of masters, they are intended to take care of their servants. So if you slander one, you are slandering his possession and potentially his pride as well, not his personal pride but in the sense that the master invested his time in training his servant and now you are slandering the result.

“There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers;

It has not gone as far as cursing my parents, but I do blame them for a lot of things. I am not sure whether I have forgiven them for this. My relationship with them is ok, but bad feelings rise up whenever I think about the past.
I have heard from others that forgiving is a lifelong process, so it could be that I have forgiven them already. However, I have never actually done it explicitly nor said it to them.

those who are pure in their own eyes and yet are not cleansed of their filth;

In my own eyes I am both pure and filthy, and I mean that in two ways. The first is, I know I have done many things wrong, but Jesus Christ has died for me and cleansed me from all my sin.
However, the second one is that I still sin but I do see myself as a Christian and one who can go to heaven.

those whose eyes are ever so haughty, whose glances are so disdainful;

Reading this line immediately reminds me of someone I knew. She had her opinion about everything and everyone, especially about the things she did not like.
I noticed I had to stay away far from her, for I would otherwise be infected by it.
This is still true. When I am around good people I tend to behave better and when I am around bad ones I will become like them.

those whose teeth are swords and whose jaws are set with knives to devour the poor from the earth and the needy from among mankind.

If am understanding correctly this verse is saying there are people who want to get rid of the poor and needy, probably by killing.
I find that appalling first of all, but peculiar as well because most would want to take advantage of the poor, such as drug dealers.
But I should know there are bad people who will stop at nothing. People like Hitler are a bunch, I just have not met them yet.
Perhaps the lesson for today is that I should be careful not to become like them either, for I think it is possible that one become bad because of bad influence.

“The leech has two daughters. ‘Give! Give!’ they cry.

It was funny when I got to understand the mockery of this text. For another translation says that the names of the two daughters are "Give" and "Give".

“There are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say, ‘Enough!’: the grave, the barren womb, land, which is never satisfied with water, and fire, which never says, ‘Enough!’

Even outside of these four things I can think of things that seem to never be enough, such as lust, materialism and pride, and these are only from the top of my mind.
So often, and even now, I myself am guilty of the above things. What way is there to stop a thirst, like that of the land above?
The only way a different kind of land. Not land from this planet, but land in Heaven will suffice. So for materialism, not Earthly materials, but Heavenly materials should be what I must long for, because these will fulfill forever.

“The eye that mocks a father, that scorns an aged mother, will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley, will be eaten by the vultures.

God has always written in His Word that we should respect our parents, independently of their behavior. So we may never mock or scorn our parents, because the least they have done to us is give us life and keep us alive.
We must also remember that whatever bad we do will be done upon us as well.

“There are three things that are too amazing for me, four that I do not understand: the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a young woman.
“This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth and says, ‘Iʼve done nothing wrong.’
Proverbs 30:11‭-‬20 NIV
[http://bible.com/111/pro.30.11-20.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.30.11-20.NIV)

These four things are amazing to me as well, but apparently for another reason than stated in the study Bibles. I find these four amazing, because I am still not sure how the first three move. Of course, by flying, moving and sailing, but knowing it in my mind, is something other than understanding it.
However, the study Bible states here that these verses are about the adulterous woman. How come there are so many men who sleep around, but there is no trail of women? This is because these women are saying they have done nothing.
Of course, men are just as bad, and yes, I am one of them, just as bad as all the other adulterers. For it is men like I who lust after other women, no matter whether they are virgin or adulterous.
Let this be a warning for me.

Proverbs 30:21-33 (NIV) 21 “Under three things the earth trembles,
under four it cannot bear up:
22 a servant who becomes king,
a godless fool who gets plenty to eat,
23 a contemptible woman who gets married,
and a servant who displaces her mistress.

Some things in this world should not happen, they are simply not logical, regardless of who invented logic. Yet they still happen here on Earth and in this time and age.
Servants who become king, and godless fools: was Hitler not a servant of the government and were many billionaires, or take Pablo Escobar, previously not mere poor people? Yet they have risen to a throne like position through vengeance paired with aggression.
Contemptible women get married all the time right now, easily into a third or fourth marriage, where no one looks up as if it is the most normal thing in the world.
Servants who displace their mistresses, I am not aware of those, except for times of war, such as in Rwanda where the Hutus ruled over the Tutsis and took away everything from them, even when they used to be their master or mistress.
I forgot one other possibility for the latter, maidservants becoming wives, because the man chooses to marry her.

24 “Four things on earth are small,
yet they are extremely wise:
25 Ants are creatures of little strength,
yet they store up their food in the summer;
26 hyraxes are creatures of little power,
yet they make their home in the crags;
27 locusts have no king,
yet they advance together in ranks;
28 a lizard can be caught with the hand,
yet it is found in kings’ palaces.

The Lord has given each its own type of power. For some it is strength, for others it is wisdom or other talents. These little creatures, who obviously cannot go up against the strength of men, still outpass mankind in many places. They have food in winter, reach places man cannot reach and have an organization structure we can never obtain.
It actually seems like the Lord prefers things other than strength and beauty. Sure, there are a few examples in the Bible of those, such as Samson and Esther, who were known for their strength and beauty, but in most cases men were renown and praised for their wisdom, persistance and obedience, such as the prophets or Hezekiah.
I should learn to know my place. I cannot be best in everything, but in what I am good at, God has given me a task.

29 “There are three things that are stately in their stride,
four that move with stately bearing:
30 a lion, mighty among beasts,
who retreats before nothing;
31 a strutting rooster, a he-goat,
and a king secure against revolt.

A few things on Earth resemble the might and dignity with which God has created them, the last one being a king secure against revolt.
Sometimes there is a certain boldness or fierce of persistance in person, who is willing to not let go because of a cause, a good one, so to speak, which gives it more power and all the more dignity. A father, determined to save his child, who does not listen to any advise from those trying to stop him, is one such.
Am I one such? Going against all human and wordly advice to reach the target of God's Kingdom? Not always. There are still times when I give in to myself and to this world, because of the pleasures it has to offer.
But this reminds me that this dignity still exists, if not in humans, then in animals.

32 “If you play the fool and exalt yourself,
or if you plan evil,
clap your hand over your mouth!
33 For as churning cream produces butter,
and as twisting the nose produces blood,
so stirring up anger produces strife.”

Some things in life are certain, and one of those is that if I stir up anger, it will produce strife, as long as I do it long enough.
If I ever do stir up anger, may God forgive me. If ever strife does not come, it is a blessing from God.
