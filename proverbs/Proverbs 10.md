# Proverbs 10
*The proverbs of Solomon: A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.*

Perhaps this has a deeper meaning. Men should love their wives as Jesus does, women should submit (in Dutch *give honor* ) to their husband because that pleases the Lord.
*And it happens to be that what women need is love and what men need is honor. This is not a coincidence.*
That is why I am thinking that obedient children bring more joy to the father while disobedient children bring more grief to the mother. In other words, the father wants obedient children in order to be more joyful, while the mother wants it to grieve less.

*Ill-gotten treasures have no lasting value, but righteousness delivers from death.*

Whatever is obtained without effort has no lasting value. I have seen people getting “lucky” with the talents they have received, smooth-talking and letting others do things they needed to do themselves. But this has its limits. Eventually they cannot stand on their own feet anymore, because they have used it too little.
Being righteous, however, will deliver you from death. If not human death it is from spiritual death. It lets you see what God sees. And it lets you avoid doing the wrong things.

*The Lord does not let the righteous go hungry, but he thwarts the craving of the wicked.*

Figuratively God does not let the righteous go hungry. The righteous might not even see righteousness happen in their lifetime, but they can be rest assured that God will revenge them. Unfortunately literally the righteous do go hungry quite often. But whoever's fault that is, God will take revenge for it.
 
*Lazy hands make for poverty, but diligent hands bring wealth.*

Lord, let me be diligent, let me be wealthy yet not for my cause but for you. To be that third man of the anabaptists, the businessman who makes brings in money for Your church.
Let my hands do Your great works. Perform miracles through me. If it is Your will, oh Lord, let your purpose be done.

*He who gathers crops in summer is a prudent son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son.*
*Proverbs 10:1-5 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.10.1-5.NIV*

Let me work hard for You, Lord, but at the right time as well. Let me not sleep or waste my time at the wrong moments.

*Blessings crown the head of the righteous, but violence overwhelms the mouth of the wicked.*

Another translation is that violence is concealed.

*The name of the righteous is used in blessings, but the name of the wicked will rot.*

Do you want your name to be used in blessings, or as examples of things gone wrong?

*The wise in heart accept commands, but a chattering fool comes to ruin.*
*Proverbs 10:6-8 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.10.6-8.NIV*

Let me accept commands from You, Lord. You are my Master and Master of everything. To You I listen, You I obey. But there are authorities I have to listen to as well.

*Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out.*

Lord, let me walk in integrity, for I long to be secure in Your hands. Though it might not seem like it, I long for peace and security, but not in the way the world sees it, but in the way You want it. For if I am persecuted, I can still be safe even if I am captured, as long as I trust in You.
Not my body, but my soul is safe and saved.

*Whoever winks maliciously causes grief, and a chattering fool comes to ruin.*

Do You mean by this that I should not give hints to accuse anyone? At the moment I am not even sure of myself whether I am maliciously doing so or not.

*The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.*

Let my mouth be a fountain of life, Lord. Let it give life to new conversations, new relationships and new or renewed faith in and obedience to You.
If it conceals violence, like it does right now I am missing out on all the blessings You have for me and others.

*Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers over all wrongs.*

Love conquers all and covers all conflicts. The conflict may be there, but with love all wrongs that are done will land softer.

*Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning, but a rod is for the back of one who has no sense.*

I am not sure if I was the type of kid who needed the rod in order to obey. Unfortunately I have never had the luck to experience the other disciplinary method of standing in a corner or being grounded.
But right now I get another chance from God. Do I want to be punished by the rod, do I want to disobey Him so much because of my own will and plans?
Lord, please teach me to be obedient. Whatever punishment I need in order to not wander from the path You have chosen for me, choose it, Lord.

*The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool invites ruin.*
I have stored up a low of knowledge, but I am not wise in this context. The wise store things up, during a conflict for example, while the fool lets things out of his mouth and in this way invite ruin. Ruin means to destroy something. If I am not building the other person up but ruining him instead, I am being a fool.

*The wealth of the rich is their fortified city, but poverty is the ruin of the poor.*
*Proverbs 10:9-15 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.10.9-15.NIV*

The poor possess nothing except their poverty and their chance of being ruined, while the rich have a fortified city to keep them rich. In other words perhaps, the wise have methods to protect them and keep themselves wise, such as a daily Silent Time and lots of reading. While the poor only lose more of the little they have.

*16 The wages of the righteous is life,*
*but the earnings of the wicked are sin and death.*

This verse seems a little bit like
*The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence*.
In the same way righteousness can give life, and wickedness causes sin, which always leads to death, death of a relationship, of a talent or of life itself.

*17 Whoever heeds discipline shows the way to life,*
*but whoever ignores correction leads others astray.*

Surely the latter applies to me. I need to be careful not to ignore correction. Currently I only listen to correction by the Holy Spirit directly, but corrections from my fellowmen I should listen to as well. *Show them the way of life* should be my motto. 

*18 Whoever conceals hatred with lying lips*
*and spreads slander is a fool.*

It does not say *Do not conceal hatred*, but it says not to do that by lying. Admit it and resolve it. Do not spread slander in this way. You are a fool if you do so, because you do not know what the consequence is. 

*19 Sin is not ended by multiplying words,*
*but the prudent hold their tongues.*

As for sin, to stop sinning, stop talking and take action. Rather yet, it may be that you are sinning because of your talking, because out of your mouth come lies and slander. You may have hurt others with your talking, or give others a bad feeling or reputation of you.

*20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver,*
*but the heart of the wicked is of little value.*

But if you are righteous, what you say is worth very much. It does not have to be much, because the words you said, you have carefully selected.
The wicked spews all kinds of words, with no value in it for you.

*21 The lips of the righteous nourish many,*
*but fools die for lack of sense.*

But the words of righteous people will nourish you, they will give you not only wisdom, but also what you need to grow.

*22 The blessing of the Lord brings wealth,*
*without painful toil for it.*

The Lord's blessings are worth more than wealth, so if it says that it brings wealth, that is surely true, although wealth does not always come in the form of money or possessions. And the Lord blesses anyone He wants to bless, but very often it is as a reward for our obedience. However, do not mistake that with our toil. We do not get blessed because we work hard for a blessing. Any blessing is a gift of grace.
We may have had painful experiences because of our obedience to God, but that is different from working hard with pain.

*23 A fool finds pleasure in wicked schemes,*
*but a person of understanding delights in wisdom.*

If this is true I am a fool indeed. I thought I could create a whole scheme, while I do not even know what will happen today. I did not even account for the fact that God could stop me.
But the worst part is, a fool is one who finds *pleasure* in it, and I did not mind the wickedness to accomplish my goal. 

*24 What the wicked dread will overtake them;*
*what the righteous desire will be granted.*

It is strange to see that the same principle does not apply to good and bad. If there is something bad you really want, it will overtake you. But if there is something good you want, it will not overtake you, but be given to you.
For example, if you really want to be rich, or want misfortune to happen to a certain person, you can be so obsessed about it that it consumes you, like hatred consumes the heart. But when you want something good for another person, though you will be changed, it will not consume you. You will not be obsessed by it or want this good thing for that person no matter what. You instead, though you wish the best for that person, will leave the final decision up to God.

In this case, however, it is not about what the wicked want, but about what the wicked fear. That what they fear, will overtake them. They will make decisions based on fear. Not out of fear for You, Lord, but for their own protection, their reputation and position.

*25 When the storm has swept by, the wicked are gone,*
*but the righteous stand firm forever.*

In this case I am not really certain who is the wicked person, am I him or is that my enemy, with whom I had a heavy discussion yesterday about who was right? Can I say that the one who keeps standing after this issue, is the one who is righteous?

*26 As vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes,*
*so are sluggards to those who send them.*

Indeed, I see people as sluggards, and their lack of actions are irritating me. It makes me not see things clear, because the irritation is blinding me.

*27 The fear of the Lord adds length to life,*
*but the years of the wicked are cut short.*

I do not have much faith in my own fate as for my remaining years as a deacon, but if it is God's will, I will stay. I suppose I have to see how many years the Lord will give me, both in my life as well as in my service to Him.

*28 The prospect of the righteous is joy,*
*but the hopes of the wicked come to nothing.*

That is good news for me, because I had much joy in seeing my future. Wherever it is that the Lord is leading me.

*29 The way of the Lord is a refuge for the blameless,*
*but it is the ruin of those who do evil.*

If I follow the way of the Lord and I get ruined, does that mean I was doing evil? Not perse, many martyrs are being persecuted for following God.
Or am I reading this verse the wrong way? Perhaps it should be: the way of the Lord is: for the blameless God provides a refuge, for those who do evil he lets them be ruined.

*30 The righteous will never be uprooted,*
*but the wicked will not remain in the land.*

It is difficult to read the words *never* and see that so many Christians are persecuted. But if God is talking about eternity then I understand. Or if God is talking about our roots in Jesus Christ, then I understand as well. Because our roots in Him will never be dug up. 

*31 From the mouth of the righteous comes the fruit of wisdom,*
*but a perverse tongue will be silenced.*

Lord, let me say wise things and know that I am righteous. *Your righteous right hand upholds me*. Let me shut my mouth if there is no wisdom in my words. 

*32 The lips of the righteous know what finds favor,*
*but the mouth of the wicked only what is perverse.*

*Finds favor* does not mean that people will owe or do you a favor, but it means that they will find favor in you and your words. 
The wicked people say what is perverse, either sexually, or otherwise morally. In any case, it is not according to God's standard.
