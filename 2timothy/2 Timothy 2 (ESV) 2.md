# 2 Timothy 2 (ESV) 
***A Good Soldier of Christ Jesus*** 
*1 You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus,* 

Paul mentioned a few of his "friends" who left him when he was imprisoned. He does not say whether they left the faith or disagreed with him like Barnabas previously did. It is likely that those people were afraid of the persecution awaiting them if they were to get caught. He hopes, however, that Timothy will not have this fear, like he does as well as Onesiphorus, and that he be strengthened by the grace that is in Jesus Christ. 
The grace of Jesus Christ is not the same as the power, faith or hope in Him, both which could be manifested in strength. With power (of healing, for example) one would not be afraid of illness, and with faith one would be able to make huge leaps such as going abroad without money, trying to face and change governments all alone, and with hope one knows that whatever happens, happens for the glory of God and according to His plan. But with grace this is not so. The grace of Jesus Christ strengthens one with the knowledge that He is good to us. The grace comes in the form of forgiveness, which we have already received, even for the sins and flaws we are going to commit, such as those people who have abandoned Paul, but it also comes in the form of all forms of power mentioned above which are given *by grace* because none of those things were deserved by us. 
Paul wanted Timothy to know that whatever the direness of the situation, Jesus would always be gracious to us and provide us with more than we deserve. See also 1 Corinthians 10:13 where it not only says that we will receive strength, but also *sufficient* strength, which is a very important element. 

::*2 and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.::* #biblestudy/memorization/nathan/todo

*3 Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 4 No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him. 5 An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. 6 It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops.*

The items mentioned above seem like a list of rules that are stated verbatim without any relation to each other or to the part before it in verse 1 and the previous chapter. They are, however, a list of characteristics that Paul asks Timothy to have, perhaps first of all referring to Jesus, as He had those as well, and second of all referring to those who had left Paul and they would not have left him if they had these characteristics. 
This list also provides motivation for maintaining character and to persevere in it. Below follows an overview of what Paul is saying.
* Encouragement: v.1. be strengthened
* Actions: v.2. teach others
* Show good character: v.3,5
* Motivation: v.4,6
About the last two items: the emphasis is on the "good soldier" part. A good soldier would not run away, as the aforementioned people have. This is motivated by verse 4: a soldier will endure war-like things. He will not get a comfortable bed, because these are things for civilians. Soldiers get into the warzone and their motivation in turn is their country for whom they are fighting. Yes, it would indeed by more comfortable to be a civilian, but the question is not what we would want, but what God wants. He is the One Who has enlisted us and asked us to fight. Now we, that is *all Christians*, have to answer God that we want to please Him and become soldiers and leave the civilian life. 
Now with becoming a soldier, even though it was for pleasing God and not for any reward, there will be rewards, because it is hard work. The soldier, just like the farmer, will get paid, but only if he has been playing by the rules. That is why desertion not only gives one no rewards, but it could even be punishable by death, especially because one would leave his brothers alone in the warzone. But when this soldier has played by the rules, he will be the first one to share in the crops. In the analogy of Christians I would not say that those Christians who have made themselves comfortable and not joined the fight will get their rewards later than the Christians who have joined the war. No, in my opinion there are no Christians who do not join the war. Every Christian is called to become a soldier. Some of those are called for more labor than others, such as the missionaries and persecuted Christians, and it is only logical that they receive the fruit of their work first. 
Those who are not compelled by the sermons they hear, by what they read in their Bibles (assuming they even read it) or what they see and hear around them in movies about or testimonies from Christians—simply are not Christians (yet). Surely it could be possible that Christians will join the war later, and they could be in preparation for it—I am not speaking of young Christians, I am speaking of the ones who supposedly have converted and have been baptized years before—but for most church-goers this is not the case. It would be like an activist who is not active. Someone who is very passionate about climate change, but does not engage in it, is not an activist—he either donates money, time or effort to his cause, regardless of what he thinks or says. A Christian by definition is an activist for God's cause. A Christian is a *follower* of Jesus Christ and following means to *walk* where Christ is and to *do* as Christ does. 
Is it not enough then to live a good moral life as Christ has done for those who cannot be active anymore? No. A good person, though poor, weak and old, unable to help himself, let alone his neighbors, would still pray for the cause of God. A less poor, weak and old person, but morally righteous who *does* good things would automatically be engaged in the warzone. He will be asked the question, sooner or later, about his views on gay marriage, transgenderism, abortion and on Trump. He will be asked for his perspective on specific movies, political situations and views of family life. As Ravi Zacharias #tags/famouspeople/christian has mentioned before: people think all religions are the same in their core and are about being or doing good, but they are only at best *superficially* the same and in their core they are completely different. 
In this case of the Christian in a non-Christian company who does good, he is only superficially the same as others. Everyone does *some* good things, such as being friendly to one's neighbor. But their core, which is that with which they *form* their perspective on life, is completely different and far-out in most cases the Christian would disagree with non-Christians on a variety of subjects. 
It is the same with the #tags/politics Left and the Right—I am not even speaking about today's *Far Left*, but about the Left of more than ten years ago. It is only on *a few* things they agree, because their *core beliefs* are completely different. The Left believes that the government should take more control of the people and that the people should turn in their freedom in return for more physical, mental and spiritual protection and facilities, such as education, from the government, while the right believes the people should have maximum freedom to facilitate and educate themselves and that the government should be minimized to merely protecting its people physically. 
In either case, whether a Christian or Republican, and very often this is the same—theoretically speaking this cannot be otherwise—one will get confronted with the other side and be engaged in this spiritual war, whether one wants to or not. There is no choice to stay neutral, withhold one's opinion and merely stick with doing "good" things. The only good thing in those cases is to speak out.

*7 Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.* 
*8 Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel, 9 for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound!*

Of course there is only Gospel and one truth, but in Acts we notice that Paul includes some elements not everyone uses when they proclaim the Gospel. Before Herod and the Sanhedrin for example he includes and emphasizes the background of Jesus, namely that He was a Jew, aside from his emphasis on himself being a Jew. Paul has much love for the Jews and though he seems to be fed up at times and wants to leave—for example in Athens #todo/opzoeken in Acts ...?? when God had to tell him to stay—his love for the Jewish brothers, who are not believers in Christ, is so great that is willing across the sea and risk being shipwrecked and persecuted, both of which happened multiple times. 
This is probably why Paul mentioned that Jesus is the offspring of David and—if my interpretation is correct—this last suffix "as preached in my gospel" refers to the suffix #todo/opzoeken/engels het stukje tussen komma's before it, not to the "risen from the dead" part. 
A question that then arises is whether the "which" refers to "my gospel" or to "Jesus Christ". In effect he is suffering for both, so the answer is not really relevant here. 

*10 Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.*

Would the "therefore" refer to the part "but the word of God is not bound"? The Word of God can never be bound by whatever chain. In this world people try to cover up the truth by overloading #todo/opzoeken/engels children with "facts", distraction, seduction, lies—and some of those lead people away from the Truth indeed, but the Word of God still remains and there are still believers. 
In every field of academics one always gets back to the Word of God when one is looking for the truth. #todo/nogaftemaken example psychology, history and archeology, political, #todo/opzoeken/engels politicologie etc. 

#todo Lucas, Johannes en daarna Handelingen lezen, aan Amy vertellen. 

*11 The saying is trustworthy, for:* 
*If we have died with him, we will also live with him;* 
*12 if we endure, we will also reign with him;* 
*if we deny him, he also will deny us;* 
*13 if we are faithless, he remains faithful—* 
*for he cannot deny himself.* 

This part speaks for itself. In the eyes of the world some parts of this saying might seem contradictory, but this is not a saying about opposites, such as: *the first shall be the last*, and *those who give their life, shall live*. On the *contrary*, it is about how God rewards one *righteously*. 
Dying with Jesus, is the ultimate sacrifice a Christian can give, and will be rewarded with life. Endurance, which is terribly difficult here in this world with all of its seductions, will be rewarded with reign. Denial, however, means that there is no reward and Jesus will also deny us. 
But being faithless—which is not a crime in itself—which means that we do not have enough faith in God, does not change what God *is*. These statements are only about God's *rewards*. 

***A Worker Approved by God*** 
*14 Remind them of these things, and ::charge:: them ::before God:: not to quarrel about words, which does no good, but only ruins the ::hearers::.*

Quarreling is a serious offense. Jesus has warned us about the power of the tongue, how it can not only destroy your own life, but those of others, simultaneously, as well. Jesus' words transformed the lives of hundreds to thousands of people in his lifetime, and that was without a megaphone like the written word. After His lifetime here on Earth He changed millions of lives. Even for those who could not read but only heard the Word and the Gospel through the mouths of His disciples or their disciples, the Words of Jesus have power no matter how often it is transferred and regardless of the time, location and situation. The Word of God is eternal and will never change. Even changed, it still has power, which we can see in the religions of the #tags/religion/jehovaswitnesses Jehova's Witnesses and the #tags/religion/lds Church of the Latter Day Saints (LDS), which use the Bible to draw their power and authority over people. They mix the truth with their own lies. What makes their religion weak are their lies. The Jehova's Witnesses do not have miracles (as far as I know) or do not boast about it, neither do the LDS. I do not know about their hope and peace in their heart, but generally speaking they have a bad name. They are moralistically speaking good people, but people see the Jehova's Witnesses as too strict, not being allowed to even have blood transfusions (sometimes not even of their own stores blood) or specific kinds of medication, because they want to allow God's will to happen. Members of the LDS, also called *mormons*, are also frequently critiqued. They are not allowed to drink alcohol, yet the rate of alcoholism in the state of Utah is higher than in any other state as well as the frequency of sexual abuse, perhaps due to the nature of the founder, Joseph Smith, who was in favor of polygamy and had multiple wives himself. 
What needs to be emphasized here is the "*charge before God*. This offense is serious enough that God needs to involved. It is a not a small relational thing or some difference between men and women, it is an actual offense against God over which God needs to judge. Now every sin against another person is a sin against God, but not every sin is emphasized in this way. 
The power of the word is so important that it is the first constitution in the Constitution of the United States and The Netherlands. At the same time, the Left #tags/politics/amendments/first is trying to limit this right by #todo/opzoeken/engels .... things they do not agree with as *hate speech*, through censorship, or defining it as debatable or unverified facts which would then give them a reason to censor speech. The latter happened during the presidential elections where obvious cases of fraud were detected in certain states. Whenever someone mentioned this on Twitter this was labeled as "questionable". Even worse, whenever someone mentioned or referred to *The New York Post*'s #todo/opzoeken/engels article on Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, who lost his laptop with many incriminating facts on his father, this message was not only censored but even banned from Twitter #todo/opzoeken/engels or was only the message blocked? 
Wrong words will ruin the hearers, even if they are not part of the discussion or debate. But censoring words will have the same impact. 

*15 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.*

Paul mentions something similar in Philippians 1:27 #todo/opzoeken 
> *Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. (NIV)*  
The reason he says this is because Christians were and will always be under continuous attack and there will be moments when we feel as if we are righteous to return these attacks. Jesus asks us to be meek. Meekness comes from the strength given by God where we do not have to prove our worth and hence do not need to be ashamed, for God has approved of us already. 
The attacks on President Trump #tags/famouspeople that happened after the riots on Capitol Hill #tags/historic events# were a stab in the heart for him, for he was attacked by members of his own party instigating and inciting or at the least waking the flames. Clearly President Trump has not called for a riot or a break into Capitol Hill and when he mentioned that the people had to "fight" it was clear to everyone that he did not mean that literally. Many #todo/opzoeken  of own cabinet resigned and left him, many Republican senators did not rise to object the election results, even his own Vice-President did not halt the election. 
Senator #todo/opzoeken ? or congresswoman Kelly Loefler #todo/opzoeken spelling? said she was willing to object the election results, but decided not to after the riots. Even though she probably means it well and does not want to give the wrong image to the people of her decision-making being biased towards the Republican Party but wants it to be based on righteousness and truth—and I truly believe that as she invoked the name of God in her Twitter messages—still, objecting an election has nothing to do with Trump supporters behaving badly. Suppose there were a bill that allowed Christians to be persecuted and *some* Christians followed the undemocratic way of protesting violently against this bill, would that mean then that as a Christian one cannot oppose this bill because that would in some way mean one condones this violence? These are two separate matters. 
Many Republicans showed a lack of courage towards their Party and its leader these days. Vice-President Mike Pence #tags/famouspeople/christian explained very well, with all of his good intentions, how the power to choose to not count some votes should not be unilateral, that is in his hands. He said it was not how the Constitution intended it. Granted, a Vice-President is chosen by Congress by a mere majority and could abuse his power for this majority by using this tactic of rejecting some votes during the next election. Pence probably did not want to be the first one to do it or set any precedents. His principle is well articulated, and even has a large core of truth, but the fact is that the Constitution—and moreover, God—has given him this power in his hands to overturn one of the greatest injustices and steals of American history, and he is not using it. He would *not* be handling outside of his legal jurisdiction. The whole reason this power has been granted for the Vice-President is *so that* he can can use it in these exceptional cases. Just like it would unconstitutional to continually and regularly use vetos or Presidential Executive Orders #todo/opzoeken/engels juiste woord but likewise it would be wrong never to use them, for else why would these exist? 
Let alone the impact on the people, trust in the voting system, the impact of the Democrats getting the power, not only in the Executive Branch but also in the Legislative, that is in *both* houses! New laws can and will be created and passed by both houses of Parliament in the very near future with—*now*— #tags/famouspeople president-elect Joseph Biden in power, which will heavily devastate what is left of the Christian foundation, which is not much. 
All we can do now, is pray to our heavenly Father. May God help America, and the rest of the world. 

*16 But ::avoid irreverent:: babble, for it will ::lead people:: into more and more ungodliness, 17 and their talk will spread like ::gangrene::. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 18 who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are ::upsetting the faith:: of some. 19 But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: “::The Lord knows those who are his::,” and, “Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.”* 

Quotes from? #todo/opzoeken  

Verse 16 is not merely about gossips, it is about irreverent talk, without respect for God. In this case specifically about the truth of the resurrection. This directly has an influence on the faith of some Christians and hence it is disrespectful towards God. 
If the resurrection had already happened, why would we still be here on Earth in this form? The people in those days had not yet received the revelation of Jesus Christ as written by John in the book of Revelations, but this knowledge might have been present, for it would only be logical that after the Resurrection something great would happen, such as being able to meet the Lord. The people who believed this version of the end-times would then upset in their faith and wonder why they had not been resurrected (with a new body) and wonder whether their faith was the right one. 
The last two quotes are given to confirm those who doubt about this. The first one, *The Lord knows those who are his*, will comfort us and let us know that whatever happens, God will never forget us. No matter how big the chaos in the end-time, God will take us out of there: in the *Great Tribulation* #tags/theology/endtimes/tribulation many Christians will die, but they will be saved for the New Earth. 
The second quote or "seal" tells us to depart from iniquity. This will comfort those who abide by it, for departing from iniquity is not something easy to be done, but when one does it, he will feel the power of  God and feel that it makes him different from the world—*exceptional* so to speak—knowing that one bears the seal of God. 
At my previous job there were many true Christians and nominal Christians and a few agnosts or even atheists. One of those unbelievers was my direct colleague whom I wanted to bring nearer to the faith and I was afraid he would see the bad examples of those nominal Christians. He, however, told me that he could see the difference between real and nominal Christians. This gave me a lot of comfort. God is righteous and merciful. All of the works of the true Christians will not have been for nothing because of the nominal Christians. 

There are three important theological doctrines in this part alone. The first one is that of the *rapture* #tags/theology/endtimes/rapture which takes place *after* the Great Tribulation, the second one is that of *once saved, always saved* #biblestudy/theology/calvinism/osas and the third one is that of *Lordship salvation* #biblestudy/theology/calvinism/osas/lordship#, which means that when one is saved once, he is always saved, but it will also mean that a person will change after he has been saved, into a better person, which will be shown in his obedience to Jesus as Lord and Master of his life, not merely as a friend against Whom he can continually sin without guilt. 
Any deviation from these doctrines, especially the latter two, will lead to deviations on the Christian faith and the path that is walked. 
A wrong view of the former doctrine, that is some people incorrectly believe that the rapture takes place before the Great Tribulation, will lead to upsetting the faith—as Paul says here. In the past predictions have been made about the end-times and those who stayed here on Earth might have felt left out and wondered why they have not been taken up to heaven. Another consequence is that they are not (mentally) prepared for the tribulations that will happen to them in the end-time, because they think they will be taken up and be saved from this anyway. 
A wrong interpretation on God's sovereignty of the second doctrine, namely that He will provide *Perseverance of the saints* will lead to doubts of whether one is saved, disregarding the many promises that Jesus gave us to ensure us in order to motivate us to hold on to the end. See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism#Five_points_of_Calvinism.
Wrongly interpreting the third doctrine leads to misleading people into *believing* they are Christians while they are not and providing bad examples for the world of the real Christian life in practice. This is often the case in churches that hold on to the *prosperity gospel* #biblestudy/theology/prosperity and is also called [hypergrace](https://www.gotquestions.org/hyper-grace.html) theology #tags/theology/grace/hyper #biblestudy/theology/grace#, and is seen in churches such as that of Joseph Prince, Joyce Meyer and Joel Osteen #tags/famouspeople Although some members of these churches actually are believers, in the end this only hampers converting new Christians because of the many examples given by those churches. 

*20 Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable. 21 Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.* 

God knows who are His, but even if we are His we can defile ourselves belong to the rest. A dishonorable vessel perhaps may never be able to be used honorably, but the other way around would surely be possible. 
When one is chosen by God, but he is defiled, he is (usually) not used for the honorable, despite his status. He still needs to be cleansed from what is dishonorable. Only then will he be used. 
Notice that one is then *set apart*. This means that he will not be used for normal things anymore, just like it is written in verse 4 that a soldier will not be entangled in civilian pursuits. A person who lives for God will notice that his life will be more and more revolving around God. More time of his hobbies will be spent on work for the kingdom, as will his time on exercise go down and his time for ministry go up. Most ministers will continue this way until their bodies fail because of the lack of care for it—which God did not intend—but generally speaking this is a good trend. 
Will those ministers then lose all contact with the secular world? No, not perse, but everything they do will be for the Lord. Some have been chosen to work in and for the kingdom of God, while others #todo/nogaftemaken  

*22 So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. 23 Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they breed quarrels.*

So many people, among whom Christians as well, are still chasing youthful passions. When people are young they chase after love, wealth, fame; some will also chase danger and a career, or to mean something to this world. But when people are older God expects of them (even more) to be more mature as well and do what actually matters for Gods kingdom. All of the above must be let go and one must behave according to the knowledge or wisdom given to him. 
Foolish, ignorant controversies is probably a term that cannot be translated from Greek but only be described in this way. #todo/opzoeken There are many subjects that will arouse people in a particular way, hitting the sweet spot or in other words, pushing one's buttons in a negative way. To each there are different buttons, but with some this is recognizable or it should be known to anyone who is mature. 
Black people for example are usually sensitive for ethnic remarks, liberal people think with their feelings and care less about facts, young people are usually unaware of the facts and believe everything they are taught. Paul says here "you know" and in doing so he confirms that mature people, and in this case especially, as his audience, mature Christians, *should* know this. Foolish means that it unnecessarily taunts people, ignorant means that one does not know how much the other person will be hurt by it. This excludes remarks from David Wood #tags/famouspeople/christian#. He knows some people will be hurt by it, but it is not unnecessary, because it is a matter of spiritual life and death whether one follows Islam #tags/religion/islam. Hence the Christian should speak of important matters and of matters he knows about and where he can expect a certain response. When there are quarrels, this (usually or always? #biblestudy/questions ) means that the questioner did not expect that kind of response. 

*24 And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome ::but:: ::kind:: to everyone, ::able to teach::, patiently enduring evil, 25 ::correcting:: his opponents with ::gentleness::.*

It is especially this feature that the Lord's servant must not have. Quarrelsome, again, seems to be a word that can not be literally translated but should be described. It is not the characteristic where people like to go into discussion with others, nor is the same as gossipping, but to me it seems the kind of behavior of a person who likes to incite discussions of less relevance that yet annoys others. Or it describes the behavior where people actually *like* to start quarrels, whereas normal people would avoid it when they can. 
Given these descriptions the opposite of being quarrelsome would then mean these features in verse 24. Being kind, for one, is easy to understand, but being able to teach is an important and invaluable feature as well. When people are not able to explain what they mean or to convince the other, they will use other methods such as brute words, other shows of strength which could result in (verbal) violence. But when one is able to teach the other, that is knowing *how to approach* the other's style, wording and understand of the matter, he can bring across his message. 
Then, after understanding the message, it is up to the listener whether he wants to *accept* this message. More often than not it is the case that unbelievers do so, and the same with Christians among each other—otherwise we would have had many more believers in this world and much less arguments between Christians. Patience is needed for this step and self-control. Self-control to control one's urges to correct the other person and to force him to accept our argument and position, and patience to hope that God is working in this person or will work in His time. 
Surrounding all of this, before, during and after a talk or discussion, gentleness is needed. The person who attacks our faith should be approached with gentleness, so that we do not take offense right at the beginning, knowing that the other person might not be so gentle and will either run away from our attacks or counterattack. But with a gentle approach the person will stay where he is. Upon an attack from the counterpart, on the other hand, we will stay where we are so that after the person has vented himself, he is hopefully and potentially more willing to listen to our arguments and accept the truth. 

*God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, 26 and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.* 

The consequences for these quarrelsome persons are immense. Paul speaks here of repentance, which is needed for every sin, regardless of its size, but this sin leads to a snare of the devil being captured by him to do his will. In other words, quarrelsomeness is in fact doing the devil's will! This is no small sin and may lead to great disturbances. This has in fact been the case and the cause for many factions within Christianity. Now I am not necessarily speaking divisions into denominations or sects such as the Plymouth Brethren and the Jehova's Witnesses, for the founders of these groups were not necessarily quarrelsome, but I am saying that quarrelsomeness may lead to divisions as big as those *eventually*. Take the examples of the many fractures of denominations within The Netherlands. This is only the *Calvinist* section within *Protestantism* (see for the full list https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lijst_van_richtingen_in_het_christendom en https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christelijke_denominaties_in_Nederland)
![]((null)/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-14%20at%2011.25.45.png)

What is even more surprising is the *reason* which caused some of these factions to come to exist, which could be as simple as the wearing of hats and the size thereof.
