# John 8 (LSB)
### An Adulteress Forgiven
**John 8:1**   But Jesus went to athe Mount of Olives. **2** Early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people were coming to Him; and aHe sat down and *began to* teach them. **3** The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and having set her in the center*of the court*, **4** they said to Him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in adultery, in the very act. **5** “Now in the Law aMoses commanded us to stone such women; what then do You say?” **6** They were saying this, atesting Him, bso that they might have*evidence* to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground. **7** But when they persisted in asking Him, aHe straightened up and said to them, “bLet him who is without sin among you *be the*cfirst to throw a stone at her.” **8** Again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. **9** When they heard it, they began*to* go out one by one, beginning with the older ones, and He was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the center*of the court*. **10** aStraightening up, Jesus said to her, “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?” **11** She said, “No one, 1Lord.” And Jesus said, “aI do not condemn you, either. Go, and from now on bsin no more.”]

Even though I personally do no think this part is in the Bible, it has ended up here anyway, and as far as I see, Biblically seen nothing is wrong with it. So we might as well learn a few lessons from it. 
The scene does not seem very realistic, first of all because of the unknown location where this took place. In which court in the temple did this take place? A woman would not be brought into the men's court, so this could have taken place in the women's court, assuming that men were allowed to enter that place. Most likely men *had* to walk through the women's court as it was (as far as I know) the only way to enter the men's court. There were gates on the left (i.e. south) side of the temple wall to enter the men's court, but I am not certain whether these could be used by people other than Levites and priests. 
A third option is the court of the Gentiles, which makes most sense as Solomon's Portico was there and Jesus (and later His disciples as well) often taught there. However, the woman was placed in the **center of the court**, which is where the temple is located. The Court of the Men and Gentiles' center was occupied by *the Holy* and the temple, respectively, and only the women's court had a center.

However, we then get to the point of *time*. Though it was early in the morning and less busy than it would be during the day, there were still a lot of people since John writes that **all the people were coming to Him**. Such an event caused by the scribes and the Pharisees would have caused even more people to come. But at the end of the story it says that all went **out [...] and He was left alone**. Some might say that Jesus was left alone in the center of the court with the woman, but it does say that the woman's accusers went *out*, and it would not mean out of the center, but out of that court. Furthermore, if only the scribes and Pharisees went out, why would all others, Jewish men and women and Gentiles, all walk away as well? 
Another counterargument of this scene being unreal is that no immoral woman would be brought into the temple, most certainly not to be punished there. By the way, this is what many movies #tags/movies such as *The Passion of the Christ* by Mel Gibson #tags/famouspeople/actors depict, but this is not what these verses say. 
A counterargument used at least in one source is that Jesus **wrote on the ground [with His finger]**. The argument is that the court's floor was paved with tiles and that Jesus would not have been able to write in the tiles. There might have been some dust and sand, but not enough to write in, given that it was morning and the floor had just been cleaned. However, this argument is not very sold as it could also mean that Jesus wrote invisible on the tiles instead of *in* the tiles.

All of this being said, v.7 seems to be a very wise answer. Jesus did not say "yes" or "no", just like when the Jews asked Him about whether taxes should be paid (Matthew 17:24-27), but came with an answer that is above man's wisdom. However, if there had been a man without sin, that is without the sin of adultery, that man would have been allowed to throw the stone. 
It is peculiar then that all had committed this sin. And even if they had, would the hypocritical scribes and Pharisees be humble enough to admit this? In this case they admitted this by walking out. 
Perhaps this scene had really happened in a different way and Jesus did say something like that, but personally I believe that Jesus would have wiser words than this, where one would not be able to escape. For there are in fact people who have not committed adultery and the fact that Jesus said that all have committed adultery when having had a sinful 

### I Am the Light of the World
**John 8:12**   Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, “aI am the Light of the world; bhe who follows Me will never walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.” **13** So the Pharisees said to Him, “aYou are bearing witness about Yourself; Your witness is not 1true.” **14** Jesus answered and said to them, “aEven if I bear witness about Myself, My witness is 1true, for I know bwhere I came from and where I am going; but cyou do not know where I come from or where I am going. **15** “aYou judge 1according to the flesh; bI am not judging anyone. **16** “But even aif I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone*in it*, but I and the Father who sent Me. **17** “Even in ayour law it has been written that the witness of btwo men is 1true. **18** “I am He who bears witness about Myself, and athe Father who sent Me bears witness about Me.” **19** So they were saying to Him, “Where is Your Father?” Jesus answered, “You know neither Me nor My Father; aif you knew Me, you would know My Father also.” **20** These words He spoke in athe treasury, as bHe was teaching in the temple; and no one seized Him, because cHis hour had not yet come.

Unfortunately I lost my notes on this part, but what it comes to is that Jesus' answer to the Pharisees' statement did not concern the physical place of where he came from. It was more like a prince telling someone: "Do you know who I am? Do you know who my father is?" For if the Pharisees had known where Jesus came from and Who He was, they would not have doubted His testimony. 
Then in v.18 Jesus also says that His Father bears witness, but the Jews are surprised to hear this, because this because they had not seen His Father. They even ask **where** His Father is (which in other versions is translated with *who*). Jesus then gives a subtle statement in His answer in v.19, indicating that they apparently were not able to see the Father. Jesus adds to that that that was because they did not know Him, for if they had known Him, they would have known the Father.

**John 8:21**   Then He said again to them, “I am going away, and ayou will seek Me, and bwill die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.” **22** So athe Jews were saying, “Surely He will not kill Himself, since He says, ‘bWhere I am going, you cannot come’?” **23** And He was saying to them, “aYou are from below, I am from above. bYou are of this world, cI am not of this world. **24** “Therefore I said to you that you awill die in your sins. For unless you believe that 1bI am*He*, cyou will die in your sins.” 

Using the analogy of a king or president again speaking to commoners, the latter will never actually comprehend the former's position just like a child can never understand adulthood and mother- or fatherhood until has come of age or is in that position. 
Recently, the movie #tags/movies *Brooklyn* #todo/opzoeken came out starring #tags/famouspeople/actors Edward Norton and Bruce Willis detectives, where the former investigates the murder on the latter by the powerful Alec Baldwin. In one scene Baldwin explained why he did what he had done, and then says: "You have never known power. Once you get it, it will make you do things, because you can get away with it." or something like that. In any case, he is trying to explain something that the simple Norton is not able to understand. 
In the same way Jesus is so much higher above them that it is impossible for them to understand, so much that not only it can be *said* that we are of **this world** but that it *actually* is so. In this case, however, it is good to be **above** and it is the only way not to die. So unless the Pharisees realize they live in sin, they will never be saved. 

> **25** So they were saying to Him, “Who are You?” Jesus said to them, “1What have I been saying to you *from* the beginning? **26** “I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but aHe who sent Me is true; and bthe things which I heard from Him, these I am saying to the world.” **27** They did not know that He had been speaking to them about the Father. **28** So Jesus said, “When you alift up the Son of Man, then you will know that 1bI am*He*, and cI do nothing from Myself, but I speak these things as the Father taught Me.   

I am assuming that Jesus is speaking here to the Pharisees, the Scribes and the Priests, but I could be wrong, because they did not know that Jesus was God and that Jesus **[spoke] these things as the Father taught [Him]**, which Jesus claimed that when He was lifted up, they would know. It would seem strange, however, if the audience suddenly changed between v.24 and v.25, that is if Jesus spoke to the Pharisees in v.24 and then to His followers in v.25. On the other hand, in v.30 we see that **many believed in Him** so either the change of audience is true or there were actually quite a few Pharisees *et al.* who did "believe in Him" (see Nicodemus (John 3,7) and the Pharisees who warned Jesus of Herod (Luke 13:31, although according to *MacSBNnkjv* it is possible that they did this to silence Him or drive Him back to Judea where the Sanhedrin had jurisdiction) or merely "believed him" as in believing that what He said was true). An additional remark to this possibility  is that the Pharisees merely *believed Him* (Gr: πιστεύω) as opposed to believing *in* Him. There is a clear difference in English in the meaning between the two verbs #todo/opzoeken/engels naam voor werkwoord i.c.m. voorzetsel. with and without this preposition. In Greek, however, this "in" is rarely used. It is used only twice in the New Testament, both in the same event by the way (see Matthew 18:16; Mark 9:42). 
The English Bible versions translate *πιστεύω* with either "to believe" or "to believe in" depending on the context, but in the Greek there is only one verb for both meanings and the reader has to interpret himself which one is meant. Cf. James 2:19 where even the demons believe there is one God.

In English a synonym to "to trust" someone would be "to believe in" someone. 
Later on, in v.37, His audience wants to kill Him again. So either Jesus is switching audiences while speaking, or the Pharisees who *did* believe Him, wanted to kill Him. The latter possibility is confirmed in vv.31-37.

**29** “And He who sent Me is with Me; aHe 1has not left Me alone, for bI always do the things that are pleasing to Him.” **30** As He was speaking these things, amany believed in Him.

See the notes above and below about the different meanings of "believing" in Jesus. See also notes on v.37 where Jesus asks why they, the same people whom He is speaking to, do *not believe*. 

### The Son Will Make You Free
**John 8:31**   So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, “aIf you abide in My word, *then* you are truly My bdisciples; 

Those **who had believed Him** were not Jesus' disciples. It is only when they **abide in [His] word** that they will be. Again, v.37 shows that these people who believed still wanted to kill Him and were of the devil. In v.45 He then proceeds to say that they do not believe in Him. 

**32** and ayou will know the truth, and bthe truth will make you free.” **33** They answered Him, “aWe are Abraham’s seed and have never yet been enslaved to anyone. How is it that You say, ‘You will become free’?”

To a Christian who understands the Gospel the answer to this question is simple. As a matter of fact it is the first statement of the Gospel in four points, which is 
1. We are sinful and need a savior.
2. Jesus Christ is this Savior and has died for our sins.
3. Jesus Christ has Resurrected and proves to be God.
4. We need to believe this and accept Him as a Lord and Savior. 

Apparently the Jews, the Pharisees here, never realized they were **enslaved**. Jesus was not talking about a human master, but about a spiritual master, in this case sin. 

**John 8:34**   Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, aeveryone who commits sin is the slave of sin. **35** “aAnd the slave does not remain in the house forever; bthe son does remain forever. **36** “So if the Son amakes you free, you will be free indeed.

The slave of sin who lives in the house of sin, will not stay in this house forever. But when the slave is ransomed he can leave the house and be free. This is what Jesus says. All of man has sinned (Romans 5:12ff) and have become slaves. 
Who, however, is **the son [who remains] forever**? If the master is sin, then what is the son of sin? And is this "son" the same son as that of v.36? Jesus Christ is the Son of God, or the Son of Heaven if you will. But how can the son of one house set the slave of another house free, who belongs to another master? This is only possible if the Son of God is willing to pay to other master, sin, but also the other master needs to agree with it. 
In this case the other master has no say, for God is Almighty and Creator of everything and needs no permission from anyone. He has purchased man from the other master, sin—not from the devil—and sin is not like the Satan, it has no thought of his own, but it is merely a concept. 
It is wrong to say that God needs to pay the Satan as the master of his slaves, because man was initially a slave of God. They might have run towards the Satan to accept him as their new master, but according to the Law the Satan has no right to keep them, because slaves have no say in anything, only their master has. 
Now man has run away and turned to sin and become addicted to sin. The devil does not need to do anything to keep the slave away from his master, God, the addiction will do the work. If a slave is addicted to heroin, he will choose heroin over his master and the slave cannot function anymore nor can he make the right choices. 
The only way to get the slave back is if he realizes he has an addiction. He has no way to stop his addiction, but he can have just enough clarity for a moment to want and decide to go back his former life with his master, God. 
In reality, it is Jesus Christ then Who took upon Himself, not the addiction, but the consequences of it, the damage and shame and everything that goes with this addiction, so that the slave is set free from the addiction, but not free from his bondage to God as His master. And so in this analogy we can replace the word "addiction" with "sin" in order to get the true story. 
#church/material/sermon

**37** “I know that you are aAbraham’s seed; yet byou are seeking to kill Me, because My word 1has no place in you. **38** “I speak the things which I have seen 1with *My* Father; therefore you also do the things which you heard from a*your* father.”

In this part it becomes clear that Jesus was still speaking to the Pharisees. They had believed, but they were still trying to kill him Him and they were still the children of the devil.
This would mean that the part above should be translated as *believe* instead of *believe in*. For they merely believed what Jesus said, but had not put their trust in Him, nor had they changed their heart.

This means then that the Pharisees understood that Jesus had spoken and everything as the Father had told Him, when they had crucified Him (v.28). This must have been an eye opening #todo/opzoeken/engels and a horrendous discovery. It is like people who discover the horrendous act of killing someone only after they have committed the murder. Judas, perhaps, is the best example of that, who only discovered, and showed remorse, after he saw Jesus being led away. Perhaps he saw Him being beaten as well. His remorse was not true though, for he did not tell anyone and did not make amends. But he realized this.
In the same way nothing is said of remorse, but only that the Pharisees would realize that Jesus spoke the truth.
This makes the realization for us about those Pharisees who kept persecuting the Christians while knowing this truth, even worse. I am not speaking of Paul, who was not aware of this. Caiaphas, even though he was not in the audience in this part, he too might have been one who had realized the truth of Jesus and he most certainly was not innocent, for he had witnessed the unfair trial against Jesus and still proceeded not only to crucify Christ but also persecute Paul. 

**John 8:39**   They answered and said to Him, “Abraham is aour father.” Jesus said to them, “bIf you are Abraham’s children, you would do the deeds of Abraham. **40** “But now ayou are seeking to kill Me, a man who has btold you the truth, which I heard from God. This Abraham did not do. 

This is a statement that cannot be proven, for not much is known about Abraham and whom he has met in his lifetime. However, we know that Jesus tells the truth and that Abraham was hospitable to stranger he did not even know (e.g. when he saw three strangers #todo/opzoeken/reference who turned out to be angels and one of them God) but also that he treated the king of Salem (perhaps this was Jerusalem), Melchizedek, with respect, even though he did not know him, but only knew that he worshipped God Almighty. From those words alone Abraham knew, perhaps through the Holy Spirit, that Melchizedek was speaking the truth. Perhaps we can base on this event that Abraham would have recognized Jesus speaking the truth as well, contrary to the Pharisees who did not recognize the truth when it was shown to them through miracles, explained to them in words and shown again with God in human form. 

**41** “You are doing the deeds of ayour father.” They said to Him, “We were not born of sexual immorality; bwe have one Father: God.” 

According to *MacSBNnkjv* the Jews were referring to Jesus' birth, Whose mother, Mary, became pregnant before she was married. They probably did not think that Mary had had sex with another man, but were referring to the act of sex before marriage. However, in my view the Jews were not referring to Jesus' birth at all, but at their own sonship of God. They interpreted Jesus statement as them having two fathers, one being God and another being the devil (or perhaps not the devil, but something worse in any case). Hence their response that they refused to believe that and said they only had **one Father: God**. With "two fathers" I of course do not mean that the Jews have two fathers, for no one can have two fathers biologically. But when the Jews said that they **were not born of sexual immorality** they meant that one did not have a father other than their mother's husband. In other words, their nominal heritage of Abraham (that is, the fact that they are carrying the name of "Jews") is the same as that of their bloodline and that spiritually they believed in and followed God as well.  
Jesus claimed otherwise, however, for their characteristics do no resemble that of Abraham at all, who was gentle and generous, humble and courageous. #todo/opzoeken/reference  references of Abraham's character. 

**42** Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, ayou would love Me, bfor I proceeded forth and have come from God, for I have cnot even come of Myself, but 1dHe sent Me. 

If God were their Father *and* if they loved Him, they would love their brother as well and anyone who came from God. So either God is not their Father or they do not love their Father, or both. In this case the answer is that God is not their Father anymore, because they have abandoned Him. They do not acknowledge Him as their Father and hence they do not love him either. 
If they had been God's children, they would have recognized their own brother, because he would bear resemblance, just like Christians recognize each other, regardless of their culture and color. Even if it was someone *sent* by the Father, such as an angel, he would be recognized by anyone who is of God. Now it is not only a brother who *resembles* God, but God Himself, not disguised per se—for His character is exactly that of God and He even says He is—but only in human form.

Furthermore, Jesus did not only **come from God [...] but He sent [Him]**. So not only was Jesus Himself from heaven, but His *mission* was also heavenly. *Everything* about Jesus was heavenly, and still the Pharisees did not see that. This is what led Jesus to speak out the words of v.43, which is not Him wondering why—for Jesus has all the answers—nor an expression of frustration—for Jesus had already expected this. 

**43** “Why do you not understand 1awhat I am saying? *It is* because you cannot bhear My word. 

Jesus is probably referring to all of the above he mentioned before, not just v.42. The statement that Jesus makes is really simple, namely that He is from God and that God is His Father. If anyone is from God he would recognize it, and if he had the same Father, he would recognize his brother. Just like a person in a specific country would recognize the accents and people of his own country. For Western people, for example, it might be difficult to recognize the different kinds of black people in Africa, although there clearly are differences between black peoples in the west, east, north and south of the continent, but African people see the differences within a country as well. Furthermore, as an example, Nigeria formally uses English as a language, but with a heavy accent. But even within Nigeria there are differences between these accent and the locals know where one is from when they hear it. 
Perhaps this is as clear to them as for Americans—whose English is actually also merely an accent—distinguishing between the different accents between states. 

The LSB writes that the Jews **do not understand what [Jesus is] saying**, which is because they **cannot hear [His] word**. The ESV translates this as "cannot bear to hear my word", but the verb "bear" has been added. This would imply that the Jews have difficulty hearing Jesus' words, as if it would hurt their ears, but in truth do not have difficulty with *bearing*, but difficulty with *understanding*. 
Why can they not understand His words? Because they have a different father. In worldly terms, they have a different culture. Some things cannot be understood by a person from a different culture. One must live in that culture for an amount of time and only then will he grasp the meaning of something and have sympathy for it.
**Example**. No respect for parents, honor and shame. Being direct. #todo/nogaftemaken

**44** “aYou are of b*your* father the devil, and cyou want to do the desires of your father. dHe was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because ethere is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks 1a lie, he fspeaks from his own*nature*, for he is a liar and the father of 2lies. 

The devil cannot stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. This might sound paradoxical, because how can one obtain the truth if those without the truth cannot stand in the truth? It is like sick people who are poor and cannot work, because they do not have money to pay for a doctor, and hence they stay poor. God is righteous, however, and does not let people start off empty handed. Everyone has the truth in him (cf. Romans 1:18-20 where the KJV even writes in v.20 that the *Godhead* is known (*divine nature* in most other translations), which is true, for everyone knows the difference between body, mind and soul. E.g. people know the difference betweens people and dogs, and between dogs and insects, that is why in general people kill insects with more ease) as it has been implanted in Him, and they also know what unrighteousness is without being taught. 
So a person has truth in him when he is born and can use this to search for more. One might argue that some have been indoctrinated to such an extent that everything they believe is a lie, which happens in most western schools these days concerning a wide range of topics, from gender biology and evolution, to religion (especially), politics and history. However, the fact they have been fed with lies, does not mean their ability to search for the truth has been taken away. This is why so many people from the Hindu #tags/religion/hinduism and Islam #tags/religion/islam religion still come to faith, because they search for the truth, which always shows itself, and it shows the kind of atrocities present in Hinduism and Islam. 
Now there are some places where children are taught not to be critical and merely follow orders, such as Nazi Germany and North-Korea. Here too, however, their talents to search for the truth are not thrown away, but are merely not used and refined. It is still possible for those people to look for the truth. 
The people who cannot stand in the truth are those who have the truth, who know and have seen the truth, and still choose to follow the lie and promulgate and propagate #todo/opzoeken/engels it. It is scientists who come to mind here, for they see the truth through science and logic—and these cannot lie. It concerns people whom I mentioned before, such as Lawrence Krauss and Bart Ehrman, who had the evidence in their hands of the truth concerning God and His creation and could interpret this either as supporting or destructive claims of the truth. 
Suppose there is an evolutionist who sees a piece of possible evidence that could claim that the theory of evolution is not true, but purposely ignores or even destroys it, because he does not believe it or want to believe it. I think it is Lawrence Krauss #tags/famouspeople/critics who said that science is not biased, and does not choose sides for either evolution or Creation but simply shows the results of the laws of physics. Though that might be true, the scientist is in fact able to manipulate the results and his publications—as has been done for at least fifty years and I do not rule out that it is as old as the lie (and thus humanity) itself—it is the scientist who chooses what is researched, and a scientist who puts clues to evidence aside, and the scientist in fact puts the truth in him aside as well. And those who have done that, cannot stand in the truth anymore. His nature, which was originally a mix of truth and lies, has now become that of lies only, and he can never go back (aside from God's intervention). 

**45** “But because aI speak the truth, you do not believe Me. **46** “Which one of you convicts Me of sin? If aI speak truth, why do you not ::believe:: Me? **47** “aHe who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear*them*, because you are not of God.”

Every now and then there is a prophet, online or in person, who claims to know what God is telling him. Not all Christians believe them though, and this prophet might be right. There is, for example, a prophetess who often prophecies about politics, but does not do so quite adamantly. The few times I have heard it, it was not specific enough to prove that her prophecies were true. There was no date given, for example, or exactly *how* God would act. Steve Cioccolanti #church/sermons/@stevecioccolanti #tags/famouspeople/christian is more specific, but not specific enough. He had a prophecy about a series of blood moons, for example, and that something would happen then. Perhaps he was right about that one, because something did happen. Some kind of agreement between Israel and the United States was signed, I think #todo/opzoeken but whether that had any significance, I do not know. 
If I read the Bible it seems much clearer concerning prophecies. The ones who believe in God believe the prophet and vice versa. Right now there is a prophecy concerning a man who does not seem to be who he says he is, and that he actually is a "predator", in the words of this prophet, someone who uses women and mistreats them sexually. So far, almost none seem to believe them, or other prophecies they have uttered, and these have not come true either. Are all not believers then? This was the case with lonesome prophets such as Isaiah and Ezekiel.
In this real-world example it seems more logical to assume the opposite, however, because we have not seen anything so far. Ezekiel's prophecies, however, took a while before they came true, just as with other prophets' prophecies. These prophecies were sometimes speaking of things occurring decades later, and I have not even waited ten years for these prophecies that I heard about personally. 
Time will tell, and we know what the rule is for those who claim to be prophets but are not. 

**John 8:48**   aThe Jews answered and said to Him, “Do we not say rightly that You are a bSamaritan and chave a demon?”

Why would the Jews call him **a Samaritan**, perhaps because of His teachings which were mixed with false ones? Jesus' teaching was different than that of the Pharisees for sure, but what was "different" from the Jews' teaching was not the same as that of the Samaritans. The Samaritans worshipped on a different mountain and that the Messiah would arrive there, but Jesus preached no such thing. The Jews would have known that Jesus' teaching was exactly that of the Old Testament and only differing in the teachings from the (Babylonian) Talmud (en nog een boek)
Misdrach #todo/opzoeken 

**49** Jesus answered, “I do not ahave a demon, but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me. 

The Jews were clearly dishonoring Him. In our present culture one would definitely dishonor another by calling him "crazy" or "possessed", especially in a formal setting and even more so when it concerns those who are in high regard, such as teachers or professors. We know that Jesus was academically on par with the Pharisees (or actually even greater than them) who were probably the ones discussing with Him here. So imagine a formal debate on a platform between two intellectuals, such as Dinesh D'Souza #tags/famouspeople/christian has had several times with Christopher Hitchens #tags/famouspeople/critics. However the latter insulted Christianity, he never insulted D'Souza or attacked him personally in this case. Perhaps this is because Hitchens is more confident of his case, is an academic and truly believes in his own philosophy. In somewhat less format debates we see weaker opponents, and perhaps much less confident ones, going for lowly tactics. Cenk Uygur, #tags/famouspeople founder of *The Young Turks*, a leftwing media channel, debated D'Souza and used his personal situation of having been arrested and gone to jail for violating laws concerning straw donations #todo/opzoeken and in other videos even discrediting him concerning his relationship with his ex-wife, all of which had nothing to do with political argumentation and the subject of the debate. Another example of this is when Muhammed Hijab #todo/opzoeken/engels  #tags/famouspeople/critics debated David Wood and could not bring forward any strong (counter)arguments (in my opinion) and bashed Wood with personal slander about him not being able to read Arabic. Later, in comments on social media, he even bashed him or another person #todo/opzoeken telling them to get a golden shower. These examples merely show the true character of those who utter these insults and dishonor their opponent. 
In the same way the Pharisees dishonored Jesus. They could have come with arguments, but there were none that proved what Jesus said was wrong. They could have asked intellectual questions, but instead only asked logical questions such as how Jesus could have seen Abraham. And then when Jesus replied, they did not even give Him the chance to explain Himself. Perhaps they would have known the answer and could have become convinced, but now they would never know because Jesus retracted Himself from them. 

**50** “But aI do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks and judges. 

Jesus merely mentions He is dishonored, not because He feels insulted, because they are doing so. This might sound hypocritical, because Jesus could have been quiet about it as well. It would be like someone telling me that I am the second best chess player of the Netherlands, upon which I then answer: "Actually, it's the number one best, but I do not seek my glory." However, Jesus says this for a reason, for He uses this as a stepping stone to explain Who God is and that even though Jesus **[does] not seek [His] glory**—although Jesus did ask God to glorify Him (see John 17) yet not through man—it is God **who seeks**, and Jesus adds to that that God **judges** as well. The judging part comes in here because Jesus has been dishonored, and when someone is dishonored it follows that there is a retributive way to regain his honor. Just like honor killings in Islam #tags/religion/islam and in Judaism #tags/religion/judaism when for example a *blood avenger*, for example the brother of a killed person, has "the right" to kill  the one who killed his brother (Footnote: Honor killings are allowed in the Bible. Numbers 35:19 #biblestudy/devotionals/numbers mentions cities of refuge where the accidental manslayer—I shall call it, that is a person who accidentally killed another—may flee to and where they can await their process—or they will be guided to this city after due process—and where the blood avenger may not kill the manslayer. If the manslayer leaves the city of refuge, he may be legally killed by the avenger. 
Does this mean that God allows vengeance? God has said, even in the Old Testament, that vengeance is His #todo/opzoeken in de text waar dit in staat ook refereren naar dit stuk. It could be interpreted in several ways. 
First of all, the accidental manslayer is not innocent. Even though he killed a person by accident he still took a life. Now there are different degrees here concerning guilt. Alec Baldwin #tags/famouspeople/actors killed a person in 2022 by using a gun that should have been loaded with blanks, but accidentally contained a bullet. #todo/opzoeken This is completely not his fault (even though he could have checked the bullets before the recordings to place) and is as near as innocent as one could get. Rather yet, the guilt should be with the one who loaded or checked the gun instead, who would obtain a higher degree of guilt, although still having done this by accident. In the same way there are people who should have looked better at where they were throwing their stones etc. So for these type of people who bear an amount of innocence, but not a complete one, their freedom is restricted to a city and to the lifespan of the currently anointed High Priest, not merely to his term of servitude, which could be as much as 30 years or more. 
The manslayer knows the rules concerning the safe city and he is free to leave, but he knows he will be at the mercy of the avenger. If he knowingly does so, there will be no retribution for him because he left the city on purpose. 

The second interpretation is that God does allow vengeance, but in an objective way. The avenger avenges his family member, but does so, not merely out of duty, but with a feeling of wrok #todo/opzoeken/engels resentment? and that is sin. It is better not to take vengeance at all when resentment is in one's heart, because one will avenge with the wrong motive. 
Hence, the best way is to let the government deal with this vengeance and let God take His role instead of taking this into our own hands. Even though it is more efficient to simply kill the manslayer, it is not simple to do this without murdering him. 

**51** “Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone akeeps My word he will never bsee death—ever.” **52** aThe Jews said to Him, “Now we know that You bhave a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets*also*; and You say, ‘If anyone ckeeps My word, he will never dtaste of death—ever.’ 

Of course Jesus was not speaking about physical death, anyone could see that Jesus did not make that claim, but why did the Jews not see that, even though they knew the concept of eternal life? Their reply to Jesus was very cynical and mocking as well. 

**53** “Surely You aare not greater than our father Abraham who died? The prophets died too; whom do You make Yourself out*to be*?” **54** Jesus answered, “aIf I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; bit is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God’; **55** and ayou have not known Him, bbut I know Him; and if I say that I do not know Him, I will be ca liar like you, dbut I do know Him and ekeep His word. 

Jesus has to remind the Jews of Who their "god" is, the one whom they supposedly worship. This is a strange situation. It could be compared to where one, a non-Muslim, has a discussion with Muslims about their religion and where the non-Muslim says: "It is your god, Allah, who agrees with me (because it is written in the Qur'an that...)". The Muslims would be inclined to deny this, naturally, for how could any non-Muslim know more about their religion than they? But there are a few differences here. In the case of Islam it is clear that people who study the Qur'an and its commentaries, the Hadith #todo/opzoeken/engels/spelling ,  will know more about Allah and his person. But with God this is not necessarily needed, because one can also hear from Him directly—which we never hear about in Islam, except the prophet Muhammad. Secondly, Jesus is not only claiming to know more about God, but that God glorifies Him.
So on the one hand it is understandable that the Jews do not believe Jesus, for He has never studied under a human tutor and He is glorifying Himself via the Father, but on the one hand He can answer every question of any difficulty from the top of His head, He shows signs and miracles and knows what people are thinking, He is beloved by everyone and loves everyone, and can show everyone His claims from the Word. His last claim that God the Father glorifies Him and that anyone Who keeps His word will not taste death, is argumented by the fact that Scripture itself says that whoever abides in God's Word will live forever (e.g. 1 John 2:17, even though this is a New Testament reference #todo/opzoeken/reference from the Old Testament). Now Jesus claimed that those who kept *His* word would not die, but this is valid when it can be proven that Jesus is God Himself or that Jesus' words are the same as the Father's. 

**56** “aYour father Abraham brejoiced 1to see My day, and he saw*it* and was glad.” **57** aSo the Jews said to Him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?” **58** Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, aI am.” **59** Therefore they apicked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus 1bhid Himself and went out of the temple.

This is not only one of the most explicit expressions by Jesus concerning His deity and equality with the Father, by saying "**I am**" but also a claim that He knows all the people (in the Old Testament) who hoped in God, personally and not only that, but that these know Him as well. What Jesus means by **My day** I am not certain of, it could mean that Abraham was looking forward to the day that he would meet God (and thus Jesus as well) or that while in heaven, Abraham knew that one day Jesus would come to Earth and was looking forward to that moment. Another possibility is that Abraham was looking forward to meeting God and the Son of God arrived, not in the form of Jesus, but in that of another man, along with two angels (#todo/opzoeken/reference ).
