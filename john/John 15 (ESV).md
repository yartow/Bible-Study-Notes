# John 15 (ESV) 
***I Am the True Vine*** 
*“I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. 2 Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.* 

Whether one bears fruit or not, each must suffer for the kingdom of God. The one who will be taken out of the Body of Christ will suffer, because he is now thrown into the world, but the branch that is pruned, will suffer in order to bear more fruit. Pruning of course, hurts less than being burned. However, pruning happens in the branch itself and requires some effort. Breaking or pulling off a dead branch or a branch that will not attach itself to the vine, is easy and fairly painless to the branch, because it was either dead already and could not feel anything or because it did not have much attachment.
In the same way, when Christians are being pruned this hurts, but know that the pain indicates you are alive and connected to Christ. So we have knowledge and confidence as to why this happens and hope for the future, because we will bear much fruit after being pruned (cf. Jer 29:11). 

*3 Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.* 

When Jesus told Peter in John 18 that he was already clean, when Peter wanted to be completely washed by Jesus, He had already told him earlier, here in verse 3, that Peter was clean. Apparently Peter forgot about this or he did not relate this cleanliness with the washing of his feet. 
This is, of course, understandable for this was only one of the many verses of wisdom Jesus has uttered. Peter could not have memorized everything the Lord had said to him nor know the (deeper) meaning of it all. 
In the same way, when we read the Word of God we do not understand everything, but sometimes we only do when we get to another part of the Bible or allow ourselves into a specific situation. 
Psalm 23 is a good example of that. It speaks of dark valleys of death which one cannot understand unless one has been there figuratively. In the daily devotional #tags/books *Streams in the Desert* the author was writing about pastor who had lost three of his children due to illness, one after another. On each of these graves, however, he wrote a verse of Psalm 23. On the first grave he wrote (from the top op my mind)
> The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.  
But after a few months when his second child passed away, he made a grave with the second verse on it
> He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters.  
And the same happened with the third child. 

He had *actually* gone through this dark valley and he knew now what David meant when he wrote this. 

*4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. 5 I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. 6 If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.* 

Dead branches burn much better than live ones. 
It seems like things that burn better are worse in the kingdom of God. Paul too used the example of flammable materials with which one builds his house. All of these materials, which symbolize the works one has done on Earth, will not be counted in the kingdom of God. 

*7 If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.* 

This destroys the argument of the Word of Faith #tags/theology/falsegospel/wordoffaith movement and that anything can be done by anyone with enough faith. Supporters of this movement often cite Matthew 17:20 about the faith like a grain of mustard seed in order to let everyone believe that physical healing and riches are for everyone with sufficient faith (Footnote: To be more precise, the Word of Faith-movement claims that when one has enough faith that Jesus wants to make you healthy or rich, you will become so.). First of all, however, the faith mentioned in this verse is about faith in *Jesus*, not in the miracle itself. Now why does this faith need to be put in *Jesus*? It is because the miracle ultimately is done *by* Jesus through the Holy Spirit. ::One must believe that the Holy Spirit *can* do it, that the Father *wants* to do it and that Jesus actually *will do* it.:: #quotes/church/composed Let us categorize the three persons of the Trinity into three objects of belief.  
Physical healing falls within the first category, because it is done by the Holy Spirit, but the third category—that is, whether Jesus will do it—depends on the second category—that is, whether the Father wants one to heal—and has nothing to do with one's faith in whether God is able to do this miracle or whether He wants to. 
Now as for the third category, v.7 provides more clarity on *what* Jesus is willing to do. The precondition for asking whatever one wishes, is that he abides in Jesus. In the next verses Jesus explains what it takes to abide in Him, or better said, in His love, which is the keeping of His commandments. So within the frame of God's commandments one can know that he is within Jesus' love and that he can ask anything of Jesus and He will provide it. In other words, Jesus will do God's will, and what God's will is, is written in His commandments. 
Physical healing and riches, however, do not (necessarily) fall within the second category of God's will, because physical healing and riches are not part of the law. To provide an example to make things more clear, it is in the Law that we must take care of the poor and weak when God commands that the outer edges of one's land may not be harvested and must be left for the poor and foreigners (Leviticus 23:22). George Mueller #tags/famouspeople/christian/missionaries asked Jesus for help to feed the poor, in this case the orphans, and Jesus was willing to help and provides because this is what the Father wanted and because the person who asked this, did this out of love for Him. 
In the Law, however, there is no commandment to heal people and make some healthy. 

*8 By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.*

This same principle is seen in humans, who inherited this of course from God, when an older generation is honored not for the many children he has, but those who bear fruit. In this case the glory goes to the grandfather who has supposedly taught his children well. In this case too, Jesus' disciples must prove themselves worthy of being His disciples by bearing much fruit. There are two main differences here with the human situation. The first one is that Jesus is the Son of the Father and His disciples are spiritually speaking the second generation of listeners of God's Word. Jesus hears and does everything the Father says and when anyone is a disciple of Jesus he will also do so, at least in as far as humans are capable. 
This is not a minor issue, because it is of the utmost importance that a disciple bears fruit and *continues* to do so through his own respective disciples. Paul notes this in the famous verse #biblestudy/memorization/nathan/todo 2 Timothy 2:2—as He has probably learned this from Jesus Himself or deducted this from His Word, but either way, he was inspired by the Holy Spirit—where he instructs Timothy not only to find disciples, but good instructors of the Word. These instructors will then get the same instructions as Timothy had received from Paul, which are to find disciples who are good instructors of the Word themselves as well, so that the process may continue indefinitely. 

The second main difference is that Jesus is the perfect disciple of the Father and the Jesus Himself has not perfect, but very well behaved disciples because of the restriction that the disciples must bear fruit in order to prove they are a disciple. This is different from the human situation where a grandfather can have many children, but only a few children who bear good fruit whereas in Jesus' case He has no disciples who do not bear fruit. In that sense one can say that there are no "bad Christians", for any Christian who acts bad is not a follower of Jesus.

**Example.** Billy Graham #tags/famouspeople/christian was noted for his sermons to large groups of people where sometimes as many as a million listeners showed up in stadiums to hear him. He regrets, however, in one of his last books *Coming home* #tags/books —I have heard, for I have not read it myself—that he had not spent enough time in his life to disciple people and if he were to do it all over again, he would have focused all of his time to disciple a small group of disciples just like Jesus has. Graham probably realized that his legacy was only that, a legacy, and the fruit would not multiply as in the case of Jesus' disciples (Footnote: It is important to note that Graham's partner with which he started his ministry ( #todo/opzoeken ) even left Christianity and became an atheist. He was the first one Graham needed to disciple. Also, theologically Graham was not completely correct, instigating the Evangelical movement, allowing false teaching to inhibit Christian teaching and pushing out fundamental Christianity at the same time.).
Graham left behind a multitude of "Christians", but how many of those stayed on the right path and gained spiritual maturity? Even own children have chosen peculiar paths, among which his oldest son, Franklin, who fortunately, has gotten back to God, but other children and grandchildren have very outspoken left and liberal views on politics and Christianity. One of those, Tullian Tchividjian, seemed to be on the path of becoming a famous pastor, but instead ended up having multiple extramarital affairs.

*9 As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. 10 If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.* 

Jesus had already said this in John 14:21. 

*11 These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.* 

In John 14:21 Jesus had already said something similar to v.10 and it seems from v.11 that He knows this and even mentions so. However, in John 14 Jesus mentions this to assure His disciples that He will manifest Himself to them and that they will be with Him and the Father, but in this chapter He emphasizes that they will *abide in His love* if they keep the Father's commandments. 
Now note that there is a difference between *to abide by* and *to abide (in)* something and that Jesus is not saying that if we keep His Father's commands that only then He will love us. Google does not clearly show this difference, but Merriam Webster does and so does the Bible. To *abide by e.g. a rule* indicates the following of rules, whereas *to abide e.g. at a location* means that one stays at a location, just like the disciples had to *stay* in a town in Matthew 10:11. In these verses, then, this means that we will stay in Jesus' love as long as we keep His commandments. 
There is, however, yet another interpretation that causes a big shift in theological doctrine, namely that of Grace or Hyper Grace Theology #tags/theology/grace/hyper. Verse 10 could also mean that if one keeps God's commandment, that is one has done that at least once, in the past, then he will *stay* in Jesus' love in the future. This would be something like *if you have married your wife, you will stay in the relationship*. However, we cannot just take grammar out of its context and apply the same rules to any sentence. The example about marriage is a formal and contractual and covenantal agreement, meaning that once you have married, you are in the relationship, regardless of how you treat your spouse. The statement says nothing about the value, i.e. the moral value of marriage and how one *should* treat one's spouse. Verse 10 on the other hand is a statement indicating a conditional truth. #todo/nogaftemaken 

Also, the specific choice of the word "keep" indicates a continuous action. In other words, it does not mean one can do something once in the past and then obtain the reward later, such as "if you work, you will get your payment." This is because of the word "keep" used in v.10. In English the word "keep" is used in constructions such as "keep doing" and "keeping something to yourself", both of which are not one-off actions but things that are done for a continuous, indefinite and longer period, unlike "working", which is done once and is not necessarily indefinite, because there is always an end to working. The same word is used elsewhere in the New Testament with the same meaning. If Jesus had meant "to do" such as in "doing God's commandment" He, or the authors of the New Testament, would have used that word and in that case that would indeed have meant a one-off action. 

*12 “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.*

People do not realize this, but the laying down of one's life is the greatest act of love. Almost any argument that arises between friends is when one is not willing to sacrifice something for the other. One friend might accuse another friend of something, perhaps unrighteously, and all the accused needs to give, i.e. to sacrifice, is his forgiveness and possibly even his reputation. Is one's life not worth more than a reputation? Is reputation not merely but a *part* of life? But if friends are not even willing to give up their reputation for one another, then they do not have the greatest love among them. 

*13 Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. 14 You are my friends if you do what I command you.*

On the other hand, when there is real love between friends and one commands the other to do something, the other would obey. When this does not happen, this usually is because one feels patronized by the other. Why would he feel patronized? Because there is a fear that his friend might want to have power over him. But that would indicate that this love is not perfect, for perfect love drives away all fear (of punishment). 
In the eyes of the world we can say that we will not do what a friend commands us, but we are still friends. The line between friendship, companionship and being an acquaintance is not clearly defined. In Jesus' eyes, however, it is very clear. 
> If you do what I command you, you are My friend.   
So in Jesus eyes only perfect love indicates friendship. 

*15 No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.*

At this point in time Jesus' knowledge was limited and everything He knew and—I assume—what the Father wanted them to know, He had already told His disciples. It could actually be that Jesus had really told them everything. Three years is a long time to be with students, six days a week and 16 hours a day of teaching. There is a lot that has not been written down, as is written in the last verse of the Gospel of John, and I expect that the whole doctrine of the end-times, eschatology, and the explanation of all the Bible books must have been explained by Jesus. 

*16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.*

Jesus speaks of ::bearing fruit:: and has used this phrase in verses 2,4 and 8. In short He answers the following questions with this metaphor. 

* What are we? We are a branch that either does not bear or it does bear fruit and then will bear more fruit. (v.2) 
* How or when do we bear fruit? If we abide in the vine, i.e. stay in Jesus. (verse 4) 
* How do we abide in the vine? If we keep His commandments. 
* Why did Jesus choose us? So that we should bear fruit. 
* Why should we bear fruit and why should our fruit abide? So that whatever we ask the Father in Jesus' Name, He will give to us. (vv.7,16) 
* To what purpose do we bear fruit? So that we can prove we are Jesus' disciples and to glorify the Father (v.8) 
	* or: why do we have to ask the Father and what do we have to ask Him? Anything we ask Him can help us to bear more fruit and glorify Him even more. 
* How do we prove we bear fruit and therefore are His disciples? By keeping His commandments (v.9) 
* What is this commandment that we have to follow? Love one another as Jesus has loved us (v.12) 

*17 These things I command you, so that you will love one another.* 

Jesus' command is to **love one another** (v.12) but in v.17 He says the goal is "*so that* you will love one another." Of course a command and a goal can be the same, but it just sounds a bit weird when someone says: "I want you to do *X* because my goal is that you do *X*", for usually the goal is higher than the command, such as when a parent tells his child: "I want you to do your homework, because I want you to get good grades." 
If we take a closer look at v.12 we see that Jesus' command is not to love one another *per se*. Personally, I think that is not possible either. Of course Jesus *can* command one—and He has already done so, in the two greatest commandments (love the Lord your God) for example—to love another, but a person is not be able if the love is not voluntary. For one cannot forcibly love another from the depths of his heart. Still, as mentioned above, Jesus has commanded this and requires nothing less, whether one is able to or not. In the same way He requires us to never commit adultery, to steal, to lie (Footnote: Actually this is *slander*, which is the real meaning of providing a false testimony against one's neighbor) or to covet, which no man or woman is capable of doing. 
In this verse Jesus commands a *requirement* of loving one another which is to do this in the same way as Jesus has done to us. So provided you already love someone, now do it in the way that Jesus loved you. This too is an impossible feat, because it requires not only the way of loving, but also the amount of love we need to give another. 

***The Hatred of the World*** 
*18 “If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.*

To Christians this is a well-known verse. We are hated and persecuted because the world hates Christ. Just like President Trump #tags/famouspeople said to the people who supported him, about the Left: #quotes/church
> *They hate me, because they hate you.*   
Christ adds to this that they hated Him *first*. Now the world loved Donald J. Trump as a billionaire, entrepreneur and as a TV-personality #todo/opzoeken/engels because he brought entertainment; the media loved him because he increased the viewers #todo/opzoeken/engels kijkcijfers. But as soon as he decided to run for president *for the Republican Party* there was not a single Left-wing news outlet that reported neutrally on him. 
Christ, however, was hated *before* there was any party. There were left-wingers or progressives, if you will, such as the Sadducees and right-wingers such as the Pharisees (Footnote: I have not researched the progressiveness and conservatism of both sects, but this is mentioned in David Pawson's sermon in the *Unlocking the Bible*-series on the book of Ezra and Nehemiah (or Lamentations??) #todo/opzoeken and perhaps also written in his book that bears the same title as the series.), but both parties were furious with Jesus for starting a new party, a fifth (or even more) one, besides those of the Zealots and the Essenes. The Pharisees and Sadducees would have hated Jesus for joining either party as there was much internal strife between at least those two parties, but when Jesus started His own party, so to speak, He received pressure from both parties and support from none. 

*19 If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you ::out:: of the world, therefore the world hates you.*

We were (past tense) *of* this world and we still are *in* this world, but now we are not *of* this world anymore, because Jesus has taken us *out* of this world. This is not very clearly written in verse 19, but John specifically wrote, c.q. Jesus said: "chose you *out* [Greek: ἐκ] of the world" and not "chose you *from* this world" which would make more sense in English. In the Dutch Herziene Statenvertaling this is also made clear where the word "chosen" is translated "uitverkoren", but another "uit" is added as "uit de wereld heb [ik u] uitverkoren." 
This means that Jesus chose us from this world to get out and be *out* of this world and thus we are not of this world anymore. #church/material/sermon 

*20 Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.*

What does it mean when Jesus says that a servant is not greater than his master? There are or could be many implications here, but the clearest one is written here: the world will persecute us. (Footnote: See also notes on Matthew 10:24.) There is also an upside to this statement: if the world keeps the words of Jesus, they will also keep ours. 

There are at least three things that this entails: 
1. Jesus was persecuted, so you will be persecuted as well. 
2. Some kept Jesus' Word, so they will keep yours as well. 
3. Jesus was exceptionally humble and self-sacrificing, our goal is to be even more.

Let us start with the first point. Jesus was persecuted and His disciples were persecuted as well. They hated Jesus and therefore His disciples as well. Did they hate His disciples more? I would suppose not for they were not the founders of the idea. Also, the world hates perfection in the eyes of God. Being less perfect would therefore arouse less hate (according to this logic at least, if it is correct). In the same way right-wing media such as the *Daily Wire* and other vloggers such as Charlie Kirk #tags/famouspeople/christian and Allie Beth-Stuckey not only attack the people involved the Left movement, but especially those leading it.

The second point gives us hope, for there are are some that have kept Jesus' Word, both in His time as well as now. No matter how bad the age was for Christianity, such as when some refer to the Dark Ages, which is true at least in part due to the increasing power of the the Pope, the Vatican and Roman-Catholicism with all of it idolatrous and blasphemous claims such as being able to enter heaven through the purchase of [indulgences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence). But even in that age there were Christians such as Martin Luther #tags/famouspeople/christian who stood up for the truth, and in the hundreds of years thereafter, even when Christian was still not widely *practised*, such as in the time of the founder of the *Army of Salvation*, William Booth, there was an ever growing multitude of missionaries bound on spreading the Gospel throughout the world. 

The two points combined let us know that we will be persecuted, but that some will receive and keep the Word. 
The third point reminds us of the Christ-like attitude we need to have in life and on mission. It is to keep us on track of moral righteousness. Anyone who forgets about this will end up like one of those infamous Prosperity Gospel (Footnote: This is also called the Health-and-Wealth Gospel (such as Joyce Meyers, Joel Osteen and Creflo Dollar #tags/famouspeople ) and part of the Word of Faith movement.) or [Hyper-grace](https://www.gotquestions.org/hyper-grace.html) or perhaps better called *Free Grace* theology preachers (Footnote: Such as Joseph Prince.). #tags/theology/falsegospel/prosperity #tags/theology/grace/hyper Even if their message is correct, which it is not, their attitude does not contain any of the humility and servitude with which Jesus lived on Earth and most certainly does not inspire their followers to have this. They themselves have become rich due to the large donations of the many members of their congregation.

*21 But all these things they will do to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me. 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.*

This is not contradictory to Romans 1:19-23, which claims that everyone would have been guilty of sin anyway, because the Law has been written on everyone's heart and the existence of God is visible in creation itself. Verse 21 clearly says that all of humanity already *knew* God and in the next two verses the proof is shown by humanity's own actions, namely the creation of images resembling gods and images of God resembling man. If they had not known or felt there was a god, they would not have created these. 
This part is difficult to interpret because "all of humanity" also conveys the people of the time He was speaking in, and around that time, throughout the world, people believed in gods, so the same guilt would apply to them as well. I would understand these verses more clearly if this was speaking of the atheist people in this world, who actually have been brought up with an image that God does not exist. 
So there are two difficulties to address here: (1) were the people of Jesus' time really without sin if Jesus had not spoken to them and done these works?—and (2) are the people of our time who have been raised up and indoctrinated with atheism, such as in socialist countries, actually innocent because they do not clearly perceive God's invisible attributes, as described in Romans 1:20, and therefore not know God? #biblestudy/questions
The answer lies in the context and cause of this sin. The sin is about persecuting the innocent. The Jews would not have been wrong to persecute Jesus and His disciples for proclaiming the Gospel and the newly risen Messiah, if Jesus had not clearly come, shown His way of life, spoken about the Word and done the miracles that the Jews had seen and heard with their own eyes. The Pharisees had seen Jesus healing a crippled man on the Sabbath (Mark 3:1-6) and instead of standing in awe and following Him, even if for the wrong reasons like the crowd did—they judged and misjudged His actions on the Sabbath. They were blinded by their rage due to their envy of Jesus, and so they were kept from seeing the miracle right before their eyes and the God-like character and person of Jesus Christ. 
So that answers the first question. How about the second question? The answer to this question is found in Romans 1:19 in the part "what *can* be known about God." No man has seen all invisible attributes of God, except for Jesus, but what can be seen about God has been shown in every country in every age (Footnote: Except for when one has been born in a cage, locked from the outside world, yet even then the awe with which one will wonder about the attributes of God will only increase such as in the movie #tags/movies *Room*, where Brie Larson #tags/famouspeople stars as a mother who has been locked up in a dark room for seven years with her son, Jack, who was born in captivity. After escaping from the room the boy can only but wonder about the size of Earth and among others the miracle of the sky itself.), even in Communist countries in the 60s or in present-day North Korea, and that should not only be enough, it is sufficient. 

*23 Whoever hates me hates my Father also. 24 If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin, but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.*

The Pharisees would consider it a great insult if anyone were to tell them they hated the Father, or in other words, God, because they did not dare call Yahweh their Father. The logic of Jesus, however, is that anyone who hates the son of the father—here meaning one who resembles him in character, personality and all other invisible attributes (see Romans 1:20f)—hates the father as well. For how can anyone love one person and all its principles and hate another person who has the same character and principles? This is only possible if one did not know the father or if he actually hated the father as well. Jesus knew the truth here. He knew that they knew God and His attributes or mercy, grace, love and righteousness, more than anyone else, for they studied the Scriptures every day. So the only option left is that they hated God and all who are like Him. 
(Footnote: In my sermon on 20210425 I mentioned that they hated God because they did not know Him. That is a mistake. What I should have said, was that it was *as if* the Pharisees did not know Him and only knew about His legal attributes and therefore hated Him, which is not true of course because of the aforementioned. The world, however, does not know God and therefore hates Him although she (or most of it) would probably still hate Him even if she did know Him.)

*25 But the word that is written in their Law must be fulfilled: ‘They hated me without a cause.’* 

See also v.18ff. The source of their hatred is unknown. Of course we know there is jealousy, or better said envy, at play here, because Jesus had more followers than they did, and there was the reprimand and harsh words of Jesus against the actions of the Pharisees and Scribes. Not much was said about the Sadducees, but we know that the Sanhedrin and most of the priests were Sadducees. Just like most of the Senate has become Democrat (Footnote: To be exact, 48 seats belong to the Democrats, 2 to Independents but the Vice-President is also a Democrat and Independents often vote for Democrats. Also, the picture below shows the Democrats are part of the majority.


![]((null)/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-28%20at%2010.30.08.png)
*Source: Wikipedia, screenshot taken on 28 Jul 2021.*) since the elections in November 6th, 2020 #tags/politics, this formation can be traced back because there was a comprehensive administration of all positions in the Sanhedrin for each term, if there were one. #todo/opzoeken is er werkelijk zoiets gevonden? Wel voor de hogepriester, maar niet voor de Sanhedrin toch? Hoe weten ze anders dat het voornamelijk Sadduceeërs waren?

*26 “But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me. 27 And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.* 

The Helper is the Spirit of truth. We know that the Father and the Son never lie, but that is not the attribute they are known for. In the greeting that Paul wrote to the Corinthians (see 2 Corinthians 13:14) we see that grace is the attribute of Jesus Christ, love is that of God and fellowship is that of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, however, has more names (such as the Comforter and here, the Helper) than just this one, just like God has many names—which is not surprising—but also multiple references or claims such as the Spirit of truth (both here and in John 14:17 and again in John 16:13) and the Spirit of life (in Romans 8:2).  
Beside the facts that all creation comes from the Son (John 1:3), and the will comes from the Father (John 5:30) we now know that all truth comes from the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is more than just power or energy, for truth could not come from an immaterial source of energy, it needs to come from a person.
