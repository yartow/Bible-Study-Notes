# Devotional 
We want to devote the children first today, during this devotional service, so I want to call forward Daniel, Laura, Levi, Benaya and the rest of the family. 

This is a nice family. Thank you all for being here with  us today to dedicate Benaya to the Lord. We have the conviction that we do not baptize children but that we dedicate them. We see this in the story of Hannah when she dedicated Samuel. 
Today, Benaya Chaim, see 2 Samuel 23, we see a mighty hero of David, whose name is Haim, which means "life". 
I will ask a few questions to the family members. I want to ask you, as well as  the parents, to love God (as we've just sung) and that your lives will become beautiful role models, so that Benaya will see the goodness of God in you, and what it means to love God. 
I am asking the parents and family members, what is your answer? Yes! Amen.. 

There is an African proverbs that says that a whole village is needed to raise a child. So we as a congregation have the responsibility to take care of them as well, and that we have to help them when they need it. Give them support, practical help etc. 
So as congregation I want to ask you. Do you understand what it means as a member of this congregation to support Benaya and his family? Amen. 

Let us pray for Benaya. 
Father God, Lord thank You  that we can bring Benaya before the thonre of grace and understand that it is a mighty task to raise children. As your  Word  says that children are a blessing of the Lord ,a nd one day we have to give Benaya back to you. Give full blessings to Benaya but the parent as well, that they may be fruitful. Give the family  the blessing and mercy to become good examples. WE expect it from you only. 
See him, look at him and do no turn away your eyes from him, until you return, so that he may see who you are, and we thank you that we can do this in Your Name. 

Amen. . 

When Laura was almost delivering the baby — Daniël is our middle son, and his oldest brother's wife Johanna was pregnant as well—I read the Psalm 102 several times which encouraged me verily, because  the times are getting much more difficult , for the children but for us as well to be raised in the promise of God. 
In psalm 102:?? The people  that is created (and Benaya was created by God) shall praise the Lord. 
This encouraged me so much, for Daniel  and Laura as well, that the people  that will be born, even the children of this generation, God will work through them, but it also gives us a ground for prayer that the Lord  Himself has said this promise, and we can say to the Lord: You never lie and you uphold Yourpromise. 
So pregnant women here as well can go to the Lord and pray for them and pray: Let my child praise Your Name. It has encouraged me so much that the Lord speaks for all kinds of situations as well as for the people  who have not been born yet. 
So hold on to this promise and to the knowledge of the Lord Jesus. 

We want to sing one song for you. 
Peace of God, Peace of God be with you. 
In Jesus ' Name I give you. 

God's Blessings, it's good to be with you. 
Let me check the time. 

I was scared a bit when I heard the brother say that we would speak about John 12 today, but we're going to do John 11 today. I am a pastor of the church above here, the Rumanian church. Perhaps you can hear us sing, but that's a good thing. 

The core text of this part is that Jesus says: I am the Resurrection and the life. 
I do not want to start reading the text, because  it's too long, and so I want to walk through the Chapter bit by bit and show you a few observations I've discovered, that might be useful for you. Let's see how far we get. 

In the name of your Son Jesus' Christ we realize that we cannot do anything  without  the power of the Holy Spirit. We are weak people  and we need you. Teach us from Your Word , that we may know you Better and if there are people  here who do not know you or your Gospel yet, let them know you. You are the one who gives life. Let your word enter our hearts. 

We pray in Jesus ' Name. 

# Message 
John 11 describes the last chapter of Jesus public life before he starts on the road to dying. It consists of four parts
* The Prologue, the hymne of the word of God (in the beginning was the word ... etc. )
* The book of signs (until chapter 12). In this second part there are seven signs of the Lord Jesus, and the resurrection of Lazarus is the 7th. 
* The book of glory or glorification, because from this moment on John starts describing Jesus' path to the cross. 
* Epilogue the ending of the book. 

What are those 7 signs? 
1. Water into wine
2. Healing of the ..
3. Healing of the lame in Bethesda
4. Jesus feeds the 5000 men
5. Jesus walks on water
6. Jesus heals the blind 
7. The resurrection of Lazarus from the dead. 

His last and biggest sign with which  he shows again and even more powerful that He is the son of God. Why does Jesus does these signs? The Bible says that He does not do this to flex his muscles, to show how great he is, but in John 20:30-31 it says that Jesus has done many other miracles, but these have been written so that you will believe that He is the son of God and that you will believe in His name. 
The signs are not miracles itself, just like traffic signs, but the sign show Jesus. If you see a traffic sign
When I drive this way to Rotterdam I see a sign saying: Rotterdam 10 km. When I see this sign, it does not mean I am at Rott  , but rather it shows me where my destination is. 
But if you're only looking at the signs, your missing the core, and the essence. 
And there were people who missed the core. People who followed Jesus when hy multiplied the bread, Jesuss aid to them:l you're following me because  you want bread. 
And so Chapter 20 

John 20:31 (ESV) 31 but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

This is also written here
Hebrews 2:2-3 (ESV) 2 For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, 3 how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard,
Hebrews 2:4 (ESV) 4 while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.

But why do we have all these miracles? To testify of Jesus. 
In Acts we see this as well, Jesus the nazarene, a man who has been appointed to do miracles and signs. 
So these signs are like traffic signs, pointing where Jesus is. 

Jesus also said: what is easier? To forgive  sins or to let someone walk. But he also said: "So that you may know that your sins have forgiven." 
The walking is not important, the forgiveness of sin is most important. It is all to show who he is. 

I won't be able to treat this chapter in the way I want to, but i Hope it will help you. 
In John 11:1 we read. 

John 11:1-4 (ESV) 1 Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 2 It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill. 3 So the sisters sent to him, saying, “Lord, he whom you love is ill.” 4 But when Jesus heard it he said, “This illness does not lead to death. It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”

There's something very important here. The sisters sent a message  to Jesus, saying 
“Lord, he whom you love is ill.”
Is it about Jesus who loves Lazarus or the other way around? It is Jesus who loves Lazarus, likewise in v.5. It starts with the love for lazaraus, not the other way around. 
Does this touch your heart, your identity? If I think about brother Jürgen? Do I think: this is a brother who loves Jesus or that he is a brother whom Jesus loves? 
In my core identity I need to know that Jesus loves me, even in my worst days, whatever  the circumstances. 

We love Him, because He loved us first. 
But we should not be so impressed by how much we love him, but about how much he loves us. 

John 11:4-8 (ESV) “This illness does not lead to death. It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”
5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 6 So, when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was. 

The theme through this chapter is that Jesus is in control.And you can see that Jesus confides in that. All things work for the good. I don't have to worry about my circumstance, because  my father leads me in my ways. And contrasting that you see the disciples, mary and Martha etc. when things happen to them, they wonder about what to do, and "why" these things happen, it's a coincidence, it's bad luck. 
But Jesus responds : “This illness does not lead to death. It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”
He is not surprised by any circumstance. immediately he know it happens for this reason.

How are things in your life, Can you trust God in that all things work for the good in your life? 

  apparently an illness can lead to the glory of God. Some find it hard to believe, God shows that Lazarus is ill, but Jesus even allows an extra two day on top of it, because   God  needs to be glorified even more. Can you imagine how frustrating this is for Mary and Martha. their idea was that Jesus would come immediately. And perhaps his disciple didn't understand either. But perhaps at the same time the disciple were glad He didn't go. 
So two days later Jesus says: 
John 11:7-9 (ESV) 7 Then after this he said to the disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.” 8 The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?” 

They thought Jesus didn't go because they were afraid of their lives, because two times before the jews tried to stone Him. 

John 8:58-59 (ESV) 58 Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.” 59 So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.

and in John 10 this happened again. And so the disciple were afraid or throught that it was better not to go there. But now Jesus still says that they should go. 
Note this answer—I didn't understand this before: 

John 11:9-10 (ESV) “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. 10 But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”

Why does Jesus all of a sudden speak about time? 
Just like there are 12 hours, and that God's intention will never change his purpose to any shorter or longer period in one's life. My life will not take a moment shorter or longer than God's perfect plan for my life. 
If you do not walk in the light, your life is unpredictable.You could die at any time. I walk with  God and no one will take my life, before my life is over. 

The Jews wanted to arrest him, but they couldn't, because ..."His hour had not yet come". We would've said: they couldn't arrest him and so his hour had not yet come. But it's exactly the other way around! 
How do you experience your life? 
Are you walking in the night? That every  action you do might be the end of your life? Or do you walk in the light, without fear of doing anything, because you know your life is in control of God's hand. 
I hope you can experience your life in this way, like Jesus did. 

"I have everything  under control, My Father has everything under control." do you trust in God's plan for your life?

John 11:11-13 (ESV) 11 After saying these things, he said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.” 12 The disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.” 

The disciples still wanted not to go to Judea. 

13 Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep.
John 11:14-16 (ESV) 14 Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus has died, 15 and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that **you may believe**. But let us go to him.” 16 So Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.”

Just to be clear. lazarus is DEAD. 
What's interesting to see is that no one has told Jesus that He is dead. In the letter it was only written that Lazarus was ill, but Jesus is omniscient. 
Jesus doesn't say, we should've gone quickly, but I'm a bit late, but maybe I can still resurrect him. It's a bit late, but I'm going to  do my best. 
No, Jesus says he's glad he was not there in time. 
Mary said: if you had arrived earlier, then he would not have died. 
This is contingency-thinking. But God's leads the way in a sovereign way, but people always think about coincidence. If something happens, then something else will happen. 

And Jesus is happy that this happened, because he has a purpose with this. 

John 11:16 (ESV) So Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.”

Thomas was being a bit of a drama queen here, which shows some courage, but still human courage. 

John 11:17-22 (ESV) I Am the Resurrection and the Life
17 Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. 18 Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off, 19 and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother. 20 So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary remained seated in the house. 

Four days in the grave. There have been more events where people had died, Jesus raised these but these had been dead for less than 4 people. 

I don't know what experience you have with dead people. In the Netherlands we're quite good at hiding death. We put people to a different department in the hospital so that people will not see how people die. And then in the morgue all things will happen. 
But in Rumania people stay in contact with the deceased one for a much longer time. 

In the first few hours of death there will be death marks, because  the blood doesn't circulate anymore, the muscles contract, and the body become stiff. The body becomes dry and cold. And the then comes the phase of deterioration, because microbes and insects will start eating the body. And then all kinds of gases come to rise, and the body will start stinking. 
Jews used cloths with herbs so that the stench would not be too stinking. That a body decomposed becomes hard. 
If you've ever seen a person with a brain or heart infarct, even if this is only for a few minutes, a part of their body dies off and this person will have to deal with this the rest of their lives. But in the case of Lazarus, this was completely hopeless, he was really REALLY dead. 
Do you understand that this is the situation of the sin in Adam. Just like the body of Lazarus was hard, so the heart of the sinner is heart as well, until someone speaks to it. 

John 11:21-27 (ESV) 21 Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 22 But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.” 23 Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” 24 Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.” 25 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, 26 and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?” 27 She said to him, “Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.”

This is the core message  that Jesus wants to show through everything. Life is not *something* but it is *someone*. As soon as  you put your life in the hands of someone, you have a connection with this Person. 
I mentioned this comparison with Adam, man and the sinner, and Lazarus in the grave. But people tell me: this is not what the story is about. But John always wants to show a deeper meaning through his stories. 
In the story of the multiplication of the bread, Jesus' story is not only about "I can do this", but about Jesus saying: I am the bread of life. 
And when Jesus heals a blind person, his message  is not that he can let people see light, but that He *is* the light. 
And when He walks on water, he shows: I don't need a way, I AM the way. And the same thing with the wine. He Is the wine rank. 
And through all of His signs, He shows that HE IS. 
He wants to show a deeper message through everything, and that's why I am bold about speaking about this deeper message. 

The resurrection of Lazarus shows a deeper message , that man is spritiually dead (Eph 1) 
Rom 3:11
Rom 1:18
Eph 4:18
Rom 5:8
1 Cor 2:14

Man's heart is hard and will not accept God. 
Man's situation is hopeless, but still something can change, by means of God's intervention. 

John 11:28-32 (ESV) 28 When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in private, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.” 29 And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him. 30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him. 31 When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. 32 Now when Mary came to where

John 11:32-37 (ESV) 32 Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” 33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled. 34 And he said, “Where have you laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.” 35 Jesus wept.

John 11:35-37 (ESV) 35 Jesus wept. 36 So the Jews said, “See how he loved him!” 37 But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this man from dying?”

John 11:38 (ESV) 38 Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.


Even if you believe that Jesus knows about all of your situations, Jesus and God still weap along with you. Even though Jesus knows what these circumstances are for and what purpose they have, He still understands your feelings. 
We ask god:L you can take away this circumstance right? 
We think God is hard for not doing this, but He is sovereign and in His sovereignty He weeps with us. Even when He makes all things work for the good, He still weeps along with us. 
Do you know this? He Knows my situation, he has a plan for me. He knows what I'm goign through. We have a God with emotions, Who weeps. 

John 11:39-42 (ESV) 39 Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, “Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.” 40 Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?” 41 So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me. 

Jesus asks nothing. He doesn't ask: Father will you please ...

John 11:42-44 (ESV) 42 I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.” 

This whole prayer has one purpose and that is show the crowd that the Father and the Son do this together. 

43 When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out.” 

Lazarus' ears were in what condition? They were dried, hard, dead, necrotic. Could he have heard this? No, of course not. Even if his ears were alive, the rest inside his head would not be alive. 
The words of Jesus has the power to bring about that which He commands. 
What did Lazarus say? Could he have said that he wanted to stay resting there? No. 
How does he stand us? He's wrapped up with cloths. How could he stand up from a lying position with  all these cloths wrapped around him like a mummy. It was like he was launched from the deathbed. 

The purpose is to show that Jesus can give life like he did to lazarus, but the deeper meaning is that Jesus can even give life to the spiritually dead people. 
He has written before that God can give those with  a heart of stone a heart of flesh. 

44 The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Unbind him, and let him go.”


There are two assignments he gives to these persons, and doesn't do himself. Jesus tells the people: 
1. Take away the stone
2. “Unbind him, and 
3. let him go.

Ad 1. This is what we're doing when we're spreading the gospel. When we take away the stone, the light will shine in the grave. When we're on the streets we talk about the gospel, like brother arthur, and then he confronts those people  with the light and the darkness of the heart. But this is not enough. Everyone  knows that you need more than just your story. 
You need the voice of the Lord that says: "Lazarus, get up." 
This is called: "effectual calling of God". 
All He called, he made righteous, and all made righteous, he has chosen. 
So there's a general calling where God has called everyone, and some can deny that, but there's also a calling which people cannot deny. Lazarus couldn't not deny Jesus' calling, he could not say: "NO, I want to stay lied down." 

Ad 2. “Unbind him, and 
The second assignment is to untie him and let him go. This is an assignment for the elders and the congregation. 
Inside he is alive, but on top of him there are still death clothes. Don't think that Lazarus was dancing because he was alive again. He was alive, but he was not finished yet. He stunk. 
It wasn't that Jesus didn't want to touch him because he stunk, but there's a spritual message here. 
A person who's converted on the streets, who's coming into the church, is coming in the church like Lazarus, still reeking after death. He's reeking after his old life. 

And just like we're called to unclothe the old life (see Ephesians 4) we need to take off the clothes of this formerly dead person. 
So if a person comes in a church and you ask him about his life, he might speak about strange things. You might wonder about whether  he

You might wonder about whether  he truly is a Christian, even though he claims to be one, but these are all parts of his old life which he needs to take off and learn about. 

I'm not going to  read the rest of John. 
But it says in v.53
John 11:53 (ESV) 53 So from that day on they made plans to put him to death.

So do you see this contrast? From the day Jesus has shown He has the capacity to give life, the jews want to kill him. 
We die, not because of the devil, but because we deserve it. 
Jesus has the capacity to give us life is only because He died for us on Golgotha. Of course he could've given this even without dying on the cross for us, but his "right judicial position" is accomplished after dying on the cross. 

## Prayer

Father, we thank You  that you let all things work for the good, that you are stronger than Death, and have put down everything  in your life to give us spiritual life. 
Thank you that when we were enemies of you, when our heart was so hard, when we were in the deeper darkness. 
You called us by name, and said: Chris, stand up, and come outside. WE can all fill in our own names. It is a calling to us personally. 
Your powerful voice we've heard. I ask that you will work through the ministry of Family Bible Church, and that you will work through people like Arthur on the streets. 
And when there are people who come from the streets, reeking after death, that they will put off their clothes and that we will be patient with them. 
Let us realize that all these things are only possible because  you died for us. 
Let your Holy Spirit raise your children in all righteousness, in your holy Name. 

Amen. 

# Holy Supper

Thank for the patience, because we ran out of time. I will make haste with the Holy Supper, but not too hastily. 
The deeper meaning of the resurrection and all the other miracles we can see here, that is that Jesus is THE Resurrection. 
Imagine that if we celebrate the Holy Supper, we remember His death, but we often forget that He has risen from the dead as well. The cross makes no sense if He didn't rise as well. 
Paul was blinded and saw the living risen Lord. What would he have thought of at the moment? One of those things in the Bible was that there is a Messiah. The Messiah pleases God, but would the Messiah die on the cross? (according to Don Carson's book)
This is totally against the image of the Messias, for Jews at least. For is it not written: Cursed is he who is nailed to a tree? 
And didn't Jesus say: My God, why have you left me? 
So how could he be the Messiah? 
But Paul had met the Lord Jesus on His way to Damascus, and with that He proves that He was pleased, for death had no grip on Him. 
You need Me (Jesus said). The Messias showed signs, had power to forgive sins and makes people alive, but cannot save himself. This doesn't make any sense. 

So the only that would let it make sense, is if he had died for something or someone else. And then it makes sense, if this is an vindicative death. He had to die and showed God's love with this. 
And just like Lazarus was raised from the dead, Jesus did as well and therefore  had to die on the cross. 
I hope that this love of God will be shown through our lives in the congregation. 

Last week I asked the non-members not to participate in the Holy Supper because there was sin present among one of the non-members. And we want to show that this Holy Supper is a holy thing, we need to do something about it. We can hide it, or we can withhold people from participating from the Holy Supper. 
We will not make known this sin to everyone here (only if the sinner persists in his sin) but we want you to pray—pray for a heart check: do I live according to the Resurrection and the will of God? 
Take one minute to think about this. 

This week, non-members are allowed to participate in the Holy Supper as well as long as they have accepted Jesus as their Lord and savior. 

Brothers and sisters, please take the bread and the wine.

Brothers and sisters, please take the bread and the wine. 

See 1 Corinthians 11:22ff. 
When we eat and drink of the wine, let us remember that the New Testament  is God's work. In the Old Testament they closed the covenant with blood, and the killed animals for it is, it was bloody. But all these covenants have been broken and it is Christ was killed instead... for us. 
Brothers and sisters, with that God proves that He has to do a work in us, and because we have life in Him, our will needs to shaped in this way that we will do what is expected of us. This is the new covenant, for in the past it was like a contract. You could choose to hold to it or not, but now God is working in us. 

## Prayer 
Heavenly Father, thank You that You aer faithful, even thoughwe have broken Your Law, You have still given us mercy. We deserve the wrath of God, and your salvation is purely grace. Thank You that we now have hope and a purpose to live for, and I pray that You, o Lord, can give us this realization of eternity, that we will not live for ourselves, but for you, for You have created us, and that we will enjoy the days of our lives, because you have given us these. 
Give us as a congregation, patience with each other, with those newly converted, and that we can disciple each other and build up each other, and that those who have falled, will be picked up. Let us do all of this while we look up to the New Jerusalem. 

In Jesus' Name. Amen.  

# Chris QA
Brother Chris has a lot of experience with the charismatic teaching and medicine, and of course with the Bible as well. 

Question 1. Are the charismatic people deliberately misleading people or are they misled themselves? 

Answer. We do not know the answer because  we cannot see their hearts. There are people who teach a false teaching which undermines the Bible. 
There are people who do this for a specific reason, such as their own reputation. 
There are also people who are serving God, but make mistakes, and should repent of those mistakes. 
I always think: these people should be very thankful to me because I show them what is wrong about their teaching. If someone comes to me and says to me that I'm wrong about one of my YouTube videos, I'm glad that this person tells me the truth, than that I found out later before the throne of Jesus. 
But my job, as apologist, is not to judge people, but judge theologies and wrong doctrines. So I'm talking about a teaching, and it could be several people who teach this wrong teaching. 
But what is 90% is Biblical? In a restaurant you also wouldn't accept 90% good food and 10% rotten. 
In the same way it is with rat poison. There's always real food added to rat poison, otherwise rats wouldn't eat it. 
I am here to judge messages and not people. 
There are people who have perhaps 5% wrong in their message, and there have to be people who tell this teacher that it is wrong. If this person is led by the Holy Spirit he will publicly acknowledge his mistake, but if he does not and continues with teachings, the odds are great that he is a false teacher and a bad person, but we have to be careful, because we cannot look in his heart. 
And so every  person I speak about in my videos, I love them, but I hope they will change and change their teaching, and people  do not always understand this. 
I've been doing this about two years already, but people tell me: Chris, you're judging the people. No I'm not judging the people  but the teaching. So I hope that these people will be confronted with the problems in their teachings. I don't care what people think about me, I only care about what Jesus thinks of me. 
Jesus has given me the power and gift to counter these teachings. 

In 2 Timothy 3:13 Paul speaks of leaders who mislead others but are misled themselves as well. It's not so easy to distinguish between the two. Usually it's a bit of both. 


## Question 2
The second question is about anointing. There seems to be a preacher who received a triple anointing. If someone goes to a congregation where there is a triple anointing, will you be contaminated and touched by it? 

Answer. In the New Testament there is no such thing as a triple anointing. There is no base in the Christian faith where we have to distinguish between people with less or more anointings. These are things that cause division in the Bible. 
If you want to take the risk to take on concepts that are not in the Bible, then you're taking the risk that you stand before the throne of God and God asks you what you've been doing in your life. 

There's this thing called grave soaking, such as going to the grave of Elisha and soaking yourself with his power. 
However, There's a difference between the Old and the New Testament. In the New Testament everyone has this anointing. 
In the Old Testament not everyone had this anointing, but in the New Testament (1 Corinthians 1:12) all Christians have been joined and we have one Body and one Spirit and we all have the Holy Spirit. And now, people starting thinking that there are higher than the other, assuming they have more anointings than the other. 
We should not waste our time with these things but rather we should preach the Gospel. The most clear sign that one is filled with the Holy Spirit is when he is preaching the Gospel. The most clear sign that one does NOT have the Holy Spirit is when they're busy with all of these charismatic anointings things. 
We should be concerned with God's workings and sanctification of our lives. 

## Question 3. 
Does Christian mindfulness or yoga have a binding effect on Christians? 

In psychiatry there are people who are sensitive to emotional changes, who easily feel rejected, who are led by their emotions and become angry (because  they feel rejected), for example at people 
 with  borderline. For These people it is useful to think before they act, think about what and why they are feeling. 

"Mindfulness" is a term from Eastern religion where people think about what they are feeling, but these Eastern gurus do not have any patent on that. Just like music, the devil has created a death metal band, and now some say that music is of the devil. No! 
So you can think about why you feel what you feel. If you are on the automatic pilot and are being led by your emotions, you sin. You might respond in a way because  of your past, your sadness etc. 
So mindfulness can go along with Christian philosophy, but when you're talking about yoga or other things, then you'll end up in a difficult danger zone. 
So explicit areas with these spiritual healings, can be dangerous. 

At De Hoop (where I work) we use emotional regulation, but this is not the same as Buddhist or Hindu idolatry. So it could be dangerous, but there are things there are useful. 

Sam: I am from the East, that's where the wise men are from...
Chris: they left the East and went to the West. 
Sam: I am a former Buddhist, and I agree with Chris that it is not sin to think about what you're doing and feeling. But there are elements in mindfulness where you have to turn off your thoughts, which is what you explicitly see in the East, where these people have experiences. And this is a sin against God because  God has created us according to his image and wants us to think like He does (imago dei) where in the East they block these, and allow for demonic experiences, which is a kick against the carrying of God's image. 
So regulation is according to the Christian world vision. 

Now we will give you the chance to ask questions, about all topics, but perhaps especially about Christian psychiatry (which is Chris' specialty). 

Han: 
My first question is about the triple anointing. 
I have a blockage when I speak with my sister about spiritual things. She was an employee working along with these Charismatic people (who talked about these anointings). 
Could she have been influenced. 

Chris: Is your sister a reborn Christian?
Han: Yes, but sometimes she leaves the Bible aside and goes her own way. 
Chris: the problem is that if you've been in a certain movement you will become influenced by these people, this happens to people in a sect as well. So in a very natural way this is almost always the outcome. If you're answer is whether  your spirit can be touched by the groups unclean spirit, then my answer is "no", because as soon as  you have God's spirit in you, you cannot have another spirit in you at the same time. You cannot have two spirits in you, Jesus and the demons. 
Because  we see in the Bible that demons become afraid of Jesus as soon as they are near Jesus. So if someone is really a reborn Christian, his spirit is clean and not touched by any group around him. But from his past he can still have some patterns. 

Han: I have left this Pentecostal church, but my sister is still in that church. 
So it's hard for me when I see them saying: "I acknowledge Jesus as the Son of God" and yet think about whether they have actually been reborn. 

Chris: the pentecostal movement, a lot of it still believes in the same core as Christianity, but I'm less convicted about the Word of Faith, but these two movement are different. 
In the Pentecostal they still believe there is a full fulfillment of the Holy Spirit, which will not come at once when you've been reborn, but which will come later, such as speaking in tongues etc. But this can be harmonized with the Gospel. 

But the Word of Faith says that Jesus has died so that you will be healthy and prosperous, and that touches and changes the core of the Gospel. This teaching is dangerous, because it says that Jesus did not only die because of your sins, but because of your healthy as well. 
But what if you are sick? Then this means that Jesus has not died for your sins, for your health nor for you at all. And then these people will start doubting whether  God is for them. And these people have no convincing answers anymore. 
So pentecostal theory is not the same as Word of Faith. 

Han: The pentecostal movement I come from is going *towards* this way of false teaching. So it is going to towards the Word of Faith. 
So in the beginning of the 20th century, the Pentecostal movement and the pentecostal movement have become intertwined more and more, and many Pentecostal churches have not resisted this movement. 
That's why it's important to distinguish between the two. And as for your family, it's important to show the right example to them, and pray for them. 

## Question 4. Elbert
I'm curious about how you approach people with a traumatic history. 
Last we were spreading the gospel to someone from iran who experienced something and was indoctrinated to not want to have anything to do with God anymore. 

Chris: when people  have ptsd (post traumatic stress) this is a big probleem. If people live in Ukraine and see people exploding on the streets this will give you an enormous level of adrenaline, not everything will experience this stress level, most people will live on with these memories, but they will not have the same stress level everytime they hear an explosion. But there are people who will think like this, that everytime when they hear an airplane crossing the sound barrier (and hearing this explosion) they think they are in the middle of the war again, and will have problems with their daily work. 
There are treatments for this, just like for diabetes. 
But the example you have right now is when the PTSD has been intertwined with the spiritual aspect of God, so that when they hear about God they think about the Iranic regime again. Now it is up to God. Do not be led by human wisdom. He needs two things: 
1. The gospel of Christ
2. Trauma treatment 

such as 
...
EMDR
Behavior therapy

these are not unChristian methods, you can seek them.

As a Christian psychiatrist, we're helping people and showing them who Christ is. Being a Christian also means being there for someone. 
I heard someone saying: we're going to visit someone who has a depression now, what do we have to tell them? 
I don't think your words are important, but the fact you're there for them, is most important. Jesus didn't say your words are important, but your presence is enough. 
You're there to be an example, a model of who Jesus is, and with that you're a testimony of the Gospel. 

## Question 5. Gino 
What is Christian psychology, who do you mix these two things together? 
How can we harmonize this? 

Chris: Psychology is a very wide concept. But where it starts is that people have all kinds of problems, could be an eating disorder, addiction, PTSD, personality disorder etc. There are so many different techniques and treatments, so it's very difficult to talk about this topic. 
But what helps, is that people talk about it. There's this thing called psycho-therapy. They talk about their past and 
Behavioral therapy, underneath this there's a world vision, with which you analyze whether your behavior is correct.
Psychodynamic therapy, 
Psycho-analysis
I cannot see with therapy is harmonizable with Christianity or not, but most therapies help people, because  God created us and these therapies do not judge us but help us to think about why I am who I am, and this is what Jesus did. He often didn't condemn people, but still talked with people, just like he spoke with the woman who had had five different men, and then he spoke with her and told her not to sin. 

It is very difficult to listen to someone for 45 minutes and not judge a person. Usually we start speaking to this person after 5 minutes already and tell him: But brother, you should.... 
But often we also see that a person is speaking for 15 minutes, and then he himself says: "You know, I'm saying all of this, but perhaps I am all wrong." 
And that is exactly what I want, that this person will discover this himself. And sometimes you can ask them, after this 45 minutes: brother, can I give you some advice? 
And then maybe  he will say "yes", but that's because you've already listened to him for 45 minutes and he feels comfortable with you, because  you didn't condemn him. 

So psychology applies this practice, but Christians often do not know about this. 

Sam: I'm not an expert but in the church of John MacArthur there is this thing called "neuthetic counseling" which is an alternative to secular psychology, which is too secular. 

## Question 5. Giselle

I have Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) before where I had to replace my negative thoughts with my postitive thoughts, but is this Christian? So for example, I said that I am not worth much. 

Chris: The Bible does say that we have to be renewed in your thoughts. You are worth very much in God's eyes. If you replace your thoughts (see Ephesians 4) when you think what the Bible says about you. 
But it will become unbiblical when you replace your bad thoughts with unbiblical thoughts, such as "I am worth a lot, because I do a lot of good things". This is just as bad as your first thought. 

However, under the hood there is a change needed in your relationship with God. 
But CBT is also used when a person cannot stand up and lies in bed all day. So the psychologist will say: you need to get up and walk a few times every day.
So the answer is really easy, and the advise usually is really easy. Eat healthy, move a lot. 
There are a lot of good psychologist, even if they are not Christian. But there are a few scenarios where I would say that you really need a Christian psychologist. 

Jürgen: We should not forget the psychology is from God Himself. People have taken wisdom of God and named it "psychology". 

2 Corinthians 2:10. Everything  is under the dominion of God, and so are our thoughts. And so we should dispose our bad thoughts and ask God to give us good thoughts. 
If we do this often enough, just like Corrie Ten Boom says, we will get used to to sound of a gong, where we hear less and less of the resounding gong. 
And in this way, you're in fact giving yourself pastoral care. 

Chris: in the deepest sense it is about rebirth. CBT will not help you to be reborn. But there are people who are not reborn who need a good treatment, and there are people who are reborn who still need help. 
So people could come to me and tell me they need a psychologist, but sometimes I tell them, no you don't need a psychologist, but Jesus! Or you need a brother who is pastorally educated and can give you care. 

## Question 7. 
Can you explain how you came to be "famous" as you are now as an apologist? 

## question 6. Roshan
We've seen things in these times such as the sexual revolution, the disappearing church, etc. but what is the best way of the church to resist these challenges. In which place is the church lacking and should they improve itself to resist better. 

Jürgen: the unity of the local congregation is what needs to change. We need to go back to the fact that we should not despise our forefathers. 
A lof of people think they can operate with the church history. I think this is not from God. But if we can work together as a unity, where some get to be marshall or general, then we can succeed. But what we see right now, is that there are a lot of separate warriors. But in church history we saw one unity fighting against the world. 
We need to be a church who has one arrow and foundation of truth, and this can only happen in unity and the acknowledgement of authority. 

Sam: all the developments we see currently
One of the things I want to mention is the love for truth. If there really is a love for truth, the people would say: see if there is a damaging way in me. This is foundational. 
Another thing is that we should God's Word as the highest authority, *sola scriptura*, this is the lens through which we should see everything. Some say the Bible is the highest authority, but when it comes to it, they are still being led by their emotion. 
This will bring us closer to the truth. It is Augustine who should: "the essence of sin is love in disorder." 
And so we should walk in unity and take steps there and put aside our own desires and longings for Christ, for the mission and for the unity. 

Chris: the Netherlands has a very post-modern culture and the vision is that everything can have their own truth, but don't tell others what your truth is. it is all relativistic, but this is not what Jesus says, for he said: I am the truth. 

Jesus  does not accept this. We have a message, and this is the gospel. The people in the the Netherlands need this message  and that is that there is but one truth. And people think that this is loving enough, so that we become a stumbling block we are not loving anymore. 
This is apologetics as well, which is why I practice presuppositional apologetics, which starts with the Bible as the truth. 
The Bible is true, and this is the apologetic method I use. 
Why do people subscribe to my channel, and that is because I think that people need the answers. I tell what I think and other people want to hear that. 
There is not a clear calling in the Bible for apologists, there are shepherds, but not apologetics, but the Bible does call us to love the truth in such a way that your love for the truth and for Jesus must be tasted by others. 
I'm merely a donkey, just like the donkey that carried Jesus. When the people are clapping, they're not clapping for the donkey but for Jesus. 
It's easy to start a YouTube channel with a lot of likes and subscribers, but all of this is not important. But whatever happened, I am the donkey that Jesus has chosen to sometimes ride on. 

## Question 7. Indy
Where exactly is the border of getting help. 

The border is when people advise you or tell you to do things that are against the Christian conscience. Suppose there is a certain sin in your life, but the psychologist tell you to keep this sin, otherwise you will change too much. 
Or you live in sin, and the psychologist tells you to just accept the sin you have, because otherwise things will get too difficult for you. Generally speaking psychologists will not do this, only bad psychologist will do that. And so sometimes these psychologists will refer you to a Christian psychologist because they understand that they do not understand you. 
So if a psychologist tells you to do this, what you do not want to do, then walk out of the room. 

## Question 8. Ilse
If you're a psychiatrist, people come to you with a problem, and then I am the authority because I am the doctor. The patient can say that I have abused my position of authority. 
So I should listen to the other person, and sometimes the other person asks me: what do you believe? And then i tell them: do you really want to know? yes? Then I will start talking about the gospel. 

So as an authority, even as an employer, you should not use your authority to impose the gospel to others. 

So sometimes people talk about that they don't want to live anymore. She will do something dangerous to herself. The only thing I can do then, is to talk to God about this. I pray that this person will hear of God. 
In De Hoop (which is Christian) there is also a Christian Christmas service, and then I know that the people who are there want to hear of the gospel, and then I can spread the gospel. 

But usually they will look you up on Google. So when people start looking me up, they will find out on YouTube and know that that I'm a Christian. And so I will also not speak about my patients on YouTube. 
For the other apologists, do not combine apologetics with psychiatry. 

## Question 9. Arthur
How do you treat people who claim they have the power of God to do certain things, such as speaking in tongues. 

Jürgen: it does not necessarily mean a person is not reborn, but I would take person by the hand and ask him why he thinks these things, and based on which Biblical grounds? As Christians we're often inclined to push off against anything against our own world vision. 
So we should give this other person the opportunity to talk about these things. Do don't reject these persons, we have a lot of friends who speak in tongues, we do not believe in speaking in tongues, but if I look at their lives, they really lead better Christian lives than mine. Despite the fact that they do not have exactly the same beliefs as we, .... we still accept them. 

You can talk about falling or being drunk in the spirit. You can think about that, but in the end, it's only one aspect of their life. as Christians we need to look at the big picture, which is that we love them. 
So we should not put Christian principles aside. It's easy to judge people, but when we do that, we might become Pharisees, because before you know that, you will think you're better. 
Fortunately, I'm not like that and this YouTube channel is only a small part of my life. So yes, sometimes people speak in tongues there, but I can help them. 
And so the danger of a ministry of apologetics on YouTube is—it is only a small part of my life, many people don't know—and I'm more concerned with my wife and children. It's very dangerous if you spend so much time on YouTube. 

Jürgen could make a video on speaking in tongues, but one week later he would have to confront those people in the church he might have hurt. 

Arthur: at the time that someone starts rolling on the floor (because of the Holy Spirit) what would you do then? 
As a doctor you first need to think about what is wrong with this person.
Airway breathing circulation

If you see someone falling, you have to wonder about why this happens? Maybe you're in the wrong place. 
If you're in a conference, then leave it. Leave your judgments aside. 

I've published a new video about phenomons, but don't base your faith and belief on these events, because this happens in each religion. So don't base your faith one whether your belief is true or not. 

Sam: there are theologic boundaries within which you can claim certain things. And there are some people who go outside of these boundaries, because they claim certain things from God, and when they go to you, they will say: who are you to speak against God's claims? 
So the clear boundaries are important that we should watch out with  all haughtiness and arrogence. Always be prepared to be the least, but do explain these theological boundaries clearly. So in this congregation we have a classical reformed teaching, this is our boundary but we are gracious to others persons and we will explain. 
So be open and transparent. Is it fair you're in a congregation which things differently about these issues

## Question 10. Petra
Petra. Is there a video about Seventh Day Adventists?

I have not made this, but I do have a video about the Sabbath, which is the core of this group. 
But the SDA have a lot of strange aspects, see e.g. SDA: Allen G. White, dietary rules etc. 

I don't know what to say to my friend who is in the SDA. 

Walter Martin: The kingdom of the cults
Has written a book about it, but it was very difficult, because they kept balancing between orthodox Christian doctrines and "just not", right on the boundary, because they think they are in a church service together with people who go to church on Sunday, and think that these people carry the mark of the beast. this is going too far to think of other Christians in this way. 
But there are other SDA's who are not that strict. 

## Question 11: Jan
Jan: Can it be that you have a very good answer from God, and then two weeks later you suddenly have another answer? 

Sam: we will not discuss personal questions here in the public, but if you have a problem, you can always go to us. 
Jürgen: if you have a question, you can come to us, but you should really come to us to ask this question, and not because you think you already know the answer. 

## Question 12. Jürgen
What do we have to do about medicine for ADHD. 

The question is whether  you actually have problem. A lung problem is easily detectable by a CT-scan. But a mental problem is much more difficult to establish. 
The problem is also that the society is implemented in a wrong way. Boys in elementary school for example are forced to sit at tables for a long time, and they cannot sit still. But there are other boys who cannot adapt to their situation, and those boys take drugs, alcohol and then function beneath their actual intelligence. 
If these boys had taken medicine, they could have finished school. But in the Netherlands people use medicine too quickly. 

Medication does not have to be bad, for example when he really cannot function well. He might be smart, but he cannot function well in school. 
In our treatment, we do not use medicine directly. We will give a child more sports, exercises first, and more breaks during school. But if it really does not help, we will use medicine. And then we will use a little bit in the beginning. 
Nothing is wrong with medication (God has given us these things), just like God has given us food. But it is possible that people can abuse these medication. 

## Question 13. Jürgen
There are five ministries:

Ephesians 4:11-12 (ESV) And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, 12 to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ,

Do apostles still exist? It's a long explanation, but it's also about semantics. So you can say there are missionaries, but on the other hand I do not believe there are apostles. 
I think there are evangelists. 
We have the elders (which is in the church), and we have evangelist (which goes outside of the church). So I do think that there are two different ministries. 

Sam: we will hold a new series called "Theology of the church". 
John Carson has written an article about: 
do the work of an evangelist, which is speaking about the ministry of evangelism, not about evangelistic work. 

So there's a difference between  ordinary and extra-ordinary ministries, and the apostles' ministry has ceased (according to dht doctrine of cessation) but God is able of course to revive certain ministries. 
So the focus of the New Testament is ... 
so the historic reformed theory of the five fold ministry is that the first three are extra-ordinary ministries, and only the latter two. 

## Question 14: Jürgen
How do I know God's will for my life? 

Chris: It depends on your question, what wife to marry, what job to choose. 
Jürgen: about your wife. 
Chris: It sounds as if you have three women in front of you. 
I believe that with God's will it starts with knowing Him better. Be focused on the congregation, so that while studying the Bible you will find out what is best for you in the kingdom of God. 
Not that you have to fast for seven days and then get a vision. God's will is that you simply live with Him and that you rejoice with Him. 

What does God want you to do? Nothing. God does not need you. God needs nothing from you, God is a giver. But Christians always think about what to do for God. 
You can rejoice in God and enjoy Him and how much He loves you. And while going, you will understand Him more and better, and you can meet Him every day. 
Perhaps God wants you to talk to a certain person in a certain store, just like it happened to me the other day when I wanted to buy a car. There happened to be a boy who recognized me and asked me about hypercalvinism. He said that if he were to die today, he would go to hell. 
This is not a coincidence, it is God's provision, and perhaps this is because God wanted me to tell this boy about God. 

Martin Luther said: suffering is imbearable if you're not certain about your salvation. 
So we spread the gospel so people  have hope and a purpose. 

Heavenly Father, I thank  You for this meeting, and for the questions, that they have been answered. I ask that your Holy Spirit will do more work so that our old lives will be brought to light (and so we can change these). 
Let our lives be formed according to your Image. Thank you fatherfor brotherChris, and spending time with us. 
Bless his ministry and eldership, and his apologetics ministry, so that other people will see his videos so that your light will be spread. 

Amen.
