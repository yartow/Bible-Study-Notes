# John 4 (ESV) 
***Jesus and the Woman of Samaria***
*1 Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John 2 (although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples), 3 he left Judea and departed again for Galilee. 4 And he had to pass through Samaria. 5 So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. 6 Jacob's well was there; so Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey, was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.*

The sixth hour could either be around noon or around 6 PM depending on how time was #todo/opzoeken/engels indicated. John, however, writes his times in the Greek/Roman #todo/opzoeken way throughout his gospel, counting the hours from sunrise, around 6 AM, so we can assume this happens around noon, when most people, if not all, do not go outside to get water. It would be a safe time then to quickly draw water without too many people standing by the well to talk to. 

*7 A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.” 8 (For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.) 9 The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) 10 Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” 11 The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?*

Even after Jesus said "**If you knew the gift of God, and who it is...**" it still does not appear to the woman that someone important might be standing before her. It straightly goes passed her. Other people might have wondered about who it is then standing before them, while others would mockingly not have cared 
#todo/opzoeken/reference #tags/movies "I don't care if you're the king of England", where? 
Perhaps this says something about the woman's character and that she is not impressed by someone's status—in a good way—indicating her humility or her simpleness #todo/opzoeken/engels right word? Also, her reply most likely indicates that she is more interested in **where [to] get that living water** than in who He is. 

*12 Are you greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock.” 13 Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, 14 but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” 15 The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.”*

Other than the movie #tags/movies depicting Jesus' life, *The Gospel of John*, where the Samaritan woman is cynically says these words, and the Italian version of the same gospel where the woman is rather neutral, here is a third version. 
The woman claims two things here: that she is **thirsty** and that she does not want **to come here to draw water**. The latter one is explained in almost all commentaries (that I have read) because of her shame for having had five husbands, regardless of the reason why, but also because of the fact that she is living with a man to whom she is not married. Even the Samaritans, who corrupted the Law of God, had shame when it concerned this. 
Her thirst might be explained from that as well. She did not want to come to draw water to prevent the feeling of shame, but she was at the same time thirsty for social contact and acceptance of the community. Any person (I think) would have said: "Sir, give me this water so that I do not have to come here to draw water." Not many would add "so that I will not be thirsty again" because thirst is not the problem, but getting the water is. 

*16 Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.” 17 The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; 18 for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.” 19 The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. 20 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.”*

The woman does not sound overtly surprised. Of course this is a matter of interpretation, but it seems the woman simply assumes that he is a prophet and therefore knows these things. The very next thing she does then is to ask a question she has—which has always been the debate between Jews and Samaritans—rather than asking him about who God is. It is very much like asking present day Christians that if they could ask God one question, what that question would be. It would probably be a question like whether women are allowed to speak, what Paul meant by wearing a head covering and what the revelation in Revelations actually mean. All of these are interesting questions, but none of these concern the character of God. 
I must say that I am guilty of that as well. These technical questions are much more interesting to me than knowing about God's character. What is there that we could ask about Him? We could ask him what real godliness means. We have never met anyone like George Mueller or John Knox #tags/famouspeople/christian/missionaries before, who are most likely closer to godliness to most people we know, who could show us what godliness is, but God still can show us, not only through other people, but also in other ways, through his Holy Spirit. 

*21 Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. 22 You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for ::salvation is from the Jews::. 23 But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. 24 God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” 25 The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.” 26 Jesus said to her, “I who speak to you am he.”*
*27 Just then his disciples came back. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, “What do you seek?” or, “Why are you talking with her?” 28 So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people, 29 “Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?” 30 They went out of the town and were coming to him.*

Even though the woman passed over the subject of her former husbands fairly quickly, she now used this sign as a testimony to spread the message to others. Her own shame has now become part of the testimony of the power of Christ. 
How can one tell of the healing power of Christ if one does not first tell of what he needed to be healed of? And how can one tell of the comfort and love of Christ if one does not speak of the discomfort, the shame and the bad self image one has? This woman spoke about her past openly. Perhaps others did not even know about it and only knew about her present situation with an unmarried man, or they had heard something or some rumors about her past. But now they knew for certain and the woman was not ashamed of speaking about this anymore, because she had found a purpose that was higher than herself, proclaiming the arrival of the Messiah.

*31 Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.” 32 But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.” 33 So the disciples said to one another, “Has anyone brought him something to eat?” 34 Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work.*

Food is something that will give one something, such as energy, nutrition, satisfaction and pleasure. Jesus implies that His own will—that is what he *wants* to do—is to do God's will. When one receives what he wants, he is pleased and satisfied. Even more so here, where **the one who reaps** is already **gathering fruit for eternal life**. Of course we cannot obtain this food and never eat any Earthly food, because we still live in human bodies, but this does say something about our some of our worldly needs that can be replaced by spiritual needs. Our need to be pleased with entertainment and satisfied with attention or something else, can easily be replaced by not putting the focus on ourselves, but on the need within the Kingdom of God. People with too much time on their hands and who are bored, have no need to be bored, because there is enough work to do and enough fruit to gain. When one argues that that is not as fun as watching worldly entertainment, that first of all has to do with one's "wanting". Apparently that person's will has not been changed by the Holy Spirit yet. But if it has, he only needs to go and reap the fruits, and he will **rejoice**. He might not know yet that there is pleasure in sowing and reaping, through evangelization, because he has never done it. But when he has done it, he will rejoice because he has sowed, and he will rejoice even more when he or another person has reaped. 

*35 Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months, then comes the harvest’? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest. 36 Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. 37 For here the saying holds true, One sows and another reaps.’ 38 I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”*

The saying probably has a negative connotation, where one does all the work, but another sows, just like the servant in the parable used to describe his master's behavior #todo/opzoeken/reference . However, Jesus puts saying in a different light. It is true that **one sows and another reaps**, but it is not a bad thing at all in the Kingdom of God! Rather yet, it is supposed to be like that. The Kingdom of God is different from all Earthly kingdoms. It is not kingdom of greed, where the one who has more talents, will obtain yet more possession, but it is one where those with much possession will share this with those who have only few talents and little possession. It is a kingdom where those with few talents will not be jealous of those with many, but be grateful for the sharing. 
**Example.** Amy Chua, Professor of Law at Yale, who is Chinese ethnic from the Philippines recalled in at least two of her books (in this case I am referring to #tags/books *World on Fire*) that her aunt was killed by her Philipino #todo/opzoeken/engels driver, her neck being slit, her possessions being stolen, and while some perhaps knew, no other servant in the house was willing to testify and not even the police or the Philipino authorities were willing to look into the matter. All of this is because the Chinese are rich (ethnic) group that have almost all big corporations in control in the country and possess most of the riches. This causes much envy among Philipinos. On the other hand, the Chinese do not treat the Philipinos with respect and perhaps more like slaves than as servants. Servants were found in the basement on mats, rather than mattresses, with the stench of urine and feces present. ( #todo check quote).  The servants in turn do not have any respect for the Chinese nor for the work they have done in building up the economy to as it is right now. Granted, the economy is still far from comparable with that of the West, but without the Chinese they would have been worse off than they were right now. 
Fortunately, in the Kingdom of God we do not have this. Unfortunately, though, not all Christians live in the Kingdom of God continually. It is like they step in and out of it. Some Christians are blessed by God and they equally bless other Christian organizations. Others, however, only give a tenth or less of their possessions (I am speaking of those who can easily afford more) while they have been blessed with far more. 
While this does not necessarily generate jealousy among Christians, as greed should not be a trait found among Christians, we do miss an opportunity here to show the world that the Kingdom of God is different. With statistics it can be shown that Republicans are generally richer than Democrats and therefore give more to charity, but it can also be shown that proportionally they give much more. However, this is not the common view of people on the Left #tags/politics/left. It is my opinion that Christian should therefore give so much that they *will not be able* to deny this, with whatsoever statistic, and that they can see that the Kingdom of God is one of sharing and caring. 
It is for this very reason that the Black community, who had been set free from slavery, emancipated, received voting rights, were allowed to have interracial marriages, etc. all by the Republicans, still voted Democrat, because the Democrats promised to give them food and money, which they were in such need of. Now the Democrats were speaking half of the truth, for they did give them food stamps and money #todo/opzoeken/engels uitkering, but they kept them at this level of welfare. The Republics on the other hand wanted the poor Black community to work for their money and so learn discipline and hard work and with those values create more welfare for themselves. Just like the Philipinos, however, they turned their backs to the ones who helped them, yet even worse. They turn their backs at Republicans instead of at the Democrats, and they vote for Democrats who have kept them poor and lied to them, while it is the Republicans who done so much good for them. 

*39 Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, “He told me all that I ever did.” 40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days. 41 And many more believed because of his word. 42 They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.”*

The people **believed** before they had met and heard Jesus, or at least they thought they did so. Now they not only believed but also *knew*. It is remarkable that the people already believed it, even though their belief was not based on anything concrete. 
Coming to real *knowledge* that Jesus is **the Savior of the world** requires a personal meeting with Him. It is not sufficient to have heard His message. Of course most people hear the message of the Gospel through a personal encounter, through a sermon or an evangelist, for example. However, that is not what has brought them to faith. 
1. It is that upon hearing that they believed that what was said, is true.
2. They realized their sins, through the Holy Spirit's conviction, and *repented*. 
3. They *decided* they wanted to change and were willing to give their whole life to Jesus Christ. 
4. God gave them through the Holy Spirit the power to work out this decision, which requires *faithfulness*. 

*Belief* comes into play in the first step, and *faith* in the fourth. 
The statement *per se* that **many more believed because of his word** does not necessarily mean that the people were saved. Perhaps this is what John means, but this statement only mentions *belief* and not the other parts of salvation, such as repentance (which can be the work of man according to some, although to others (such as Calvinists) even repentance must be the work of the Holy Spirit) and faithfulness (which can only be the work of the Holy Spirit, as far as I know this is true according to every doctrine).
A major difference between existing doctrines and what I write here, is that (again, as far as I know) all doctrines do not distinguish between *faith* and *belief*, whereas I have defined *belief* as written above, and *faith* as that which is needed to be faithful. 

*43 After the two days he departed for Galilee. 44 (For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.)*

Perhaps this explanation is added to explain why Jesus went from Jerusalem to Galilee, instead of to His hometown of Capernaum, where He lived. In the picture below Capernaum is located at the northern point of the Sea of Galilee.

*45 So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast. For they too had gone to the feast.*

***Jesus Heals an Official's Son***
*46 So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill. 47 When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. 48 So Jesus said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.” 49 The official said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.” 50 Jesus said to him, “Go; your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way.*

Why did Jesus tell the official that he would **not believe** even though he did upon the words of Jesus. Perhaps it was to taunt him, such as telling someone: "You won't be able to do that, because you're afraid" upon which the other would say: "I will do that and I'll show you!" 
Jesus words could also have meant that the official would not believe in Jesus as the Messiah and as Son of God if he did not see any **signs and wonders**. The man **believed the word** that his son would heal, but this does not mean that he believed Jesus was God. 

There is still another way can look at this matter. Perhaps the man did not have believed that his son had healed, at the time of v.48, but because Jesus *spoke* he believed, because there was power in His words. It is, perhaps, something like when Jesus said the words: "I am He" (John 18:5) upon which the soldiers drew back and fell to the ground. Jesus has probably said these three words before, citing them or as part of a sentence, but now that He said this as an *authoritative answer* these words had *power* and could move people backwards. It would be something like if Jesus had said: "If I were to tell you that I am God you would not believe me," where the other would answer: "Yes, indeed, I wouldn't believe you." And then when Jesus says: "I Am God!" the other would fall down on his knees and perhaps beg for mercy because he had seen the living God. The first time Jesus said the same three words "I am God" there was no effect but when Jesus said it with power, the effect is clearly seen. 
This is why the literal words of God have no power unless the Spirit is with the person who reads or says them.

*51 As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering. 52 So he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.” 53 The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live.” And he himself believed, and all his household. 54 This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.*

It is clear from this paragraph that it is only now that the official believed *in Jesus* and not only in the fact that the miracle would happen. 
This shows that the belief in a miracle to happen can be increased when the miracle actually takes place. Just like Christians already believe that God can heal, but when he does, and when Christians see these things, such as when people with cancer or other illnesses are healed, their belief in God increases, and with it—sometimes—their faith as well.
