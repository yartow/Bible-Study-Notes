# Ezra 6
#biblestudy/devotionals/ezra


Ezra 6:14-15 (ESV) They finished their building by decree of the God of Israel and by decree of Cyrus and Darius and Artaxerxes king of Persia; 15 and this house was finished on the third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.

#biblestudy/questions Darius was the king between Cyrus and Artaxerxes, according to Wikipedia? Does that mean that after Ezra left, Cyrus lived only a few years? 

Also, where in this list must we place Darius?
