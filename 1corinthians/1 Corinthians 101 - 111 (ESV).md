# 1 Corinthians 10:1 - 11:1 (ESV) 
**Warning Against Idolatry**
*1 For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, 2 and all were ::baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea::, 3 and all ate the same spiritual food, 4 and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that ::followed:: them, and the Rock was Christ. 5 Nevertheless, with most of them God was ::not pleased::, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.*

As the pericope heading already mentions Paul is warning us against idolatry. Not only is he warning against idolatry, he is warning against pride or haughtiness in 1 Corinthians 10:12. His main message is that people should not *think* they are saved by merely a few spiritual activities or the experience of a few miracles.  
The "for" with which this paragraph starts, indicates that he refers to the previous paragraph where he stated that we should all run the race. Here Paul is emphasizing that this applies to *everyone*. It did not matter that the Israelites were of the same generation as Moses and had seen the miracles with their own eyes and drank the same drink from the rock, which is symbolically seen Jesus, because it was He Who provided water, shelter—and other forms of protection and sustenance—and therefore life in the desert. And so neither Paul, who has seen Jesus with his own eyes, nor the apostles, who have eaten his bread and touched him, are exempt from this and must fight the battle that is before them. 

*::6 Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did.::* #biblestudy/memorization/nathan *7 Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.”*

#todo Aan Nathan vertellen dat dit herhaald wordt in Hoofdstuk 15.  

*8 We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. 9 We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents, 10 nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer.*

Paul then mentions a few examples of where the Israelites were not obedient in their sexual immorality, tempting Christ and grumbling. Perhaps Paul purposely mentions this order #todo/opzoeken chronologie, regardless of the chronology of the events described in Genesis, because he aims to show that even "light" indulgence and desiring of evil will lead to death. 

*11 Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come. ::12 Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall. 13 No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.*:: #biblestudy/memorization/nathan 
*14 Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. 15 I speak as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. 16 The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? 17 Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread. 18 Consider the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? 19 What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? 20 No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. 21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. 22 Shall we provoke the Lord to ::jealousy::? Are we stronger than he?*

Paul mentions that the food offered to idols and the idols themselves do not have significant importance. But during the sacrifice the "person" to whom pagans sacrifice is not the idol, but the demon. Also the one who eats, becomes a participant in the altar. So if one eats food offered to idols, which is to demons, he is participating not in idol worship, but in demon worship. That in itself is a sin, but it is also a sin to make the Lord jealous. 
For example if a married man has dinner with another woman, not with the intention to seduce and the woman has no interest in the man either, then that could still be sin, for it could make his wife jealous. 
In this case of participating in a religious sacrifice and eating the meat, that is clearly a step further than merely eating with a woman—it would rather be something like eating in a fancy restaurant, dressed in a good suit. 

As for the last question of whether we are stronger: is Paul asking whether we are stronger than the Lord or than the demon? In the former case, does he mean that we are not tempt Someone Who is higher than we? Or is he referring to our weakness against temptation (v.12) in that we should not think that we can eat and participate in a demonic rite and think we will not be affected by it. 
The context seems to point to the latter when we look at vv.12-14 where the *therefore* points to the verses before it. 

The question remains then whether we can eat this meat or not. #todo/nogaftemaken here it says not, in a previous verse we could, and Jürgen says we can only eat it outside of a rite. Food on the meat market would be allowed. #biblestudy/questions

***Do All to the Glory of God***
*23 “All things are lawful,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful,” but not all things build up. 24 Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.*

Where does this quote come from? It could have been derived from the statement—perhaps even by Paul himself—that we are not under the Law anymore (see for example from Romans 8:2) or it could have been derived from one of the Corinthians' false Greek ~sophist~ teachings, such as in 1 Corinthians 6:13 about food for the stomach, where the same quote as in v.23 here is used as well. #biblestudy/questions

*25 Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience. 26 For “the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.” 27 If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience. 28 But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience— 29 I do not mean your conscience, but his. For why should my ::liberty:: be determined by someone else's conscience?*

Paul is not speaking of his physical liberty here—because that is obviously constrained by another person's conscience—but about his internal liberty, for he feels and knows he is just as free in Christ as before he met this person and his conscience is just as clean as when he eats or does not eat meat. 

*30 If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?*

Thankfulness by itself is no valid argument to be excused to commit a sinful act. One could be truly thankful for a meal offered to idols or even to get his portion of heroin in the extreme case. Paul is not speaking about something being morally right or wrong here, but about one's conscience being clear. When a person genuinely give thanks, his conscience is clear about that for which he give thanks being a good thing. A person using drugs would not genuinely be thankful for he would know this is a bad thing and that actually does not want it, but is hooked on it. Many prostitutes are only working in that sector because they are addicted to drugs, but they do not see any way out.

*31 So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. 32 Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God, 33 just as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.*
*1 Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.*

Generally this refers to Paul's behavior as a whole, but more specifically this only refers to this part or chapter concerning the what we eat, because this is a grey area where rules are not defined clearly. The best way would simply be to do as Paul does, as he has a better view of what Christ has told him. 
We should note that this should not be interpreted as a commandment nor as a commandment to imitate all of what Paul is, for then everyone should stay single and not receive a salary. Concerning the former one could say that this is only for those who have been given the gift of being single (#todo/opzoeken quote from Jesus) but concerning the latter, this would then apply to everyone, whether he is an Evangelist or not, for everyone should spread the Gospel (1 Corinthians 9:17). So unless someone says that he agrees with that and that every person spreading the Gospel, that is every Christian, should not receive any income, he will agree that this verse does not apply to all that Paul said.
