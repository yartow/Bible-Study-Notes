# 1 Corinthians 1 (ESV) 
***Greeting***
*1 Paul, called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes,*
*2 To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:*
*3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.*

***Thanksgiving***
*4 I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus, 5 that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge— 6 even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you— 7 so that you are not lacking in any gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 8 who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 9 God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.*

***Divisions in the Church***
*10 I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment. 11 For it has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there is quarreling among you, my brothers. 12 What I mean is that each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.” 13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? 14 I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, 15 so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name. 16 (I did baptize also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.) 17 For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.*

Each one is sent to do something else. Some have baptized and others have preached the Gospel. Many people converted during Billy Graham's speeches #tags/famouspeople/christian although perhaps there might be some social imitation there, for when 500 people come forward during a call for repentance, the threshold to be the 501st is much lower. But Graham did not baptize, as far as I know.
Others like Kent Hovind #tags/famouspeople/christian have a different ministry, which preaching the truth about creation, and John Baker, who passed away in 2021 #tags/famouspeople/christian, felt he needed to reach out who needed emotional healing. In both cases the outreach was to both Christians and unbelievers. Both of them, however, link their ministry to the Gospel, because knowing the truth about creation and science, is worth nothing if one does not have Jesus, and complete emotional healing in the way that God wants is only comes thorugh accepting Jesus Christ as one's Lord and Savior.
Paul's calling as described here in v.17 is very specific. It is to *preach*, to do it *simply* and to preach *the Gospel only* (1 Corinthians 2:2). Furthermore we know he targets the Jews in the diaspora (for example Aquila, Priscilla and Timothy) and the gentiles (such as Luke). 
#biblestudy/questions However, I do wonder what Paul spoke of during his time in Corinth, for he did not stay there for a short time and I cannot believe he *only* spoke of the Gospel. Even Paul Washer #tags/famouspeople/christian, who preaches the Gospel in every sermon, preaches and teaches more than just the good news. 

***Christ the Wisdom and Power of God***
*18 For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19 For it is written,*
*“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,*
*and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.”*
*20 Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe.*

The answer to the question in verse 20 where all those intellectuals are, is that they are not present in the Christian community. Yes, there are Christians who are intellectuals, but all of them have considered themselves fools and weaklings, like Paul who showed his weakness and fear (1 Corinthians 2:3, cf. 2 Corinthians 11:6-7) instead of his worldly strength and intelligence that others, even Jesus's disciples, were afraid of (see Acts 9:1,26). 

*22 For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, 23 but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, 24 but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.*

Wisdom is portrayed as a woman in Proverbs 8 and though Solomon provides many examples of what wisdom is, Jesus lived it out in His life. He is the *living* example of wisdom.  God has shown in many ways His power, but the living example of that is in Christ, for He could not be destroyed and rose up from the dead. He could not be caught or hurt by a mob nor tempted, not even by the devil himself after forty days of fasting. 

*26 For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. 27 But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; 28 God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, 29 so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. 30 And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, 31 so that, as it is written, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”*

The point of this part is that no one should boast, whether he is by worldly standards better or worse. God wants all people to humble themselves, but especially in His presence. God is always present so probably what is meant here is that anywhere where God's Name is mentioned, Christians should show that their strength and wisdom is not from the world, but from God alone. 

**Prayer.** Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned badly in this field. I have shown my wisdom too many times and obtained my strength from that. I have not humbled myself before you, before the congregation and boasted of my wisdom to obtain the honor that was due You. Please forgive me for my haughtiness in thinking I could convince anyone of any fact. Thank You for humbling me. 
Too many times people have complimented me for my wisdom, even when I have mentioned any of my credentials. This is because I have not humbled myself and hidden my wisdom. I was proud and happy to hear these compliments, but the glory should be yours, not mine. 
Thank You for giving me the opportunity to humble myself in this period that I do not have a job, so that You can show through me that my strength is from You alone and my satisfaction comes from You alone. 
Amen.
