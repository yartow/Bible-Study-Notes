# 1 Corinthians 8 (ESV) 

***Food Offered to Idols***
*1 Now concerning food offered to idols: we know that “all of us possess knowledge.” This “knowledge” puffs up, but love builds up.*

This part of the sentence is quoted from somewhere. #todo/opzoeken  where and how do we know for certain? but Paul says that this knowledge that he is referring to, is not the right kind of knowledge, but one that puffs up, or in other words, it makes one proud. Apparently Paul assumed the Corinthians knew what he was talking about. Either way, it was not making anyone better off. The one with "knowledge" felt inferior and therefore had to boast of his knowledge, while the others became irritated by the ones boasting. 
Love, on the other hand, builds up everyone. The one with inferior feelings will be built up if he knows he can try and make mistakes in order to grow and the ones who are knowledgeable do not need to boast, for they will be loved and respected by the community members for the knowledge they have not boasted about, but rather passed on to others. 

*2 If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know. 3 But if anyone loves God, he is known by God.*

There is quote said by someone a few decades ago perhaps, which is not actually his, for nothing is new under the sun, which goes something like: #quotes
> The more I know, the more I realize the less I know.  
This is of course what Paul is speaking of here. How about love then? Can we say we know love? In the movie #tags/movies *Good Will Hunting* Robin Williams #tags/famouspeople/actors told his co-star Matt Damon when he taunted him with the separation of the former's wife—he did not know that she died of cancer but thought she had left him for another man—that the young Will Hunting knew nothing of love and was a mere kid. He was incredibly smart and thought he knew everything there was in the world, and indeed had more knowledge than anyone else, but he knew nothing about love, because he had never experienced it. So what happens if we claim we know love and claim to love God? Paul does not address this issue and perhaps he does not even care. All he cares about is whether someone actually *loves* God, for only then he is known by God. 
A person might not be very intelligent and cannot explain what love is, not even knowing how to treat his loved one, but his love can be genuine. As Tom Hanks #tags/famouspeople/actors said in #tags/movies *Forest Gump* 
> I might not know a lot of things, but I know what love is.   

*4 Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that “an idol has no real existence,” and that “there is no God but one.” 5 For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”— 6 yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.*

There many lords, such as prime-ministers and kings and presidents, but all of them have someone lording over them, and all of them are fallible humans, prone to temptation and sin. One of the sins of these people is also that they think they are gods. Take for example sexual scandals in the higher circles, which happen in all countries, but let us take the United States here. Bill Clinton #tags/famouspeople perhaps already had a sex addiction before he was governor but one of his most infamous actions was the rape or sexual asssault of an intern or assistent #todo/opzoeken during his seat as governor of Arkansas. After this had passed through some settlement (or perhaps not #todo/opzoeken ) he just went on with his behavior towards women as usual. The affair with Monica Lewinsky is known to all, but how many others have come before and after that? As long as he has the money and power to silence people, he will not stop sinning as much as he wants to. He will go on until he becomes too publicly exposed. 
In that sense not only he, but all other people in power, are prone to the addiction to power. Whereas people in the West are somewhat limited in their sin by the Western moral values based on Judeo-Christian values, in other places where these values are not present the power of a person in power of a #todo/opzoeken/engels machthebber is extended to much greater heights, as we see in the case of China's Xi Jin-Ping and North-Korea's #tags/famouspeople Kim Jong-Un. All of them want to be gods and already behave like gods, but there is none who wants to be god because he wants to improve the world. 
Also there is none who created anything, but rather they only absorbed the beauty that our God in heaven created. Literally there is none. Some have tried to create a better world, and they created concepts such as communism #tags/ideology/communism, but these destroyed more than they created. Capitalism created a few things, such as more wealth and inventions, but capitalism was not invented by anyone except God. 

*7 However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, through former association with idols, eat food as ::really:: offered to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.*

Not all possess this knowledge and some really think that the Pharaoh for example was a god himself. But all Christians should know that all other gods are fake. However, even though they rationally know this, emotionally they are still attached to their former life and idol. Even though this idol is not put higher than God—so by definition it is not an idol anymore—still, their *conscience* is defiled. The conscience is our measuring stick to know what is straight, humanly speaking, for even those who do not have the Holy Spirit have a conscience. The conscience, however, can be "bent" such that straight things are not measured as being straight and vice versa. Therefore, their conscience should have told them that it is allowed for them to eat meat offered to an idol, because first of all the idol is not real, but second of all and more importantly, God is greater than that idol and His rules override all other rules and even our conscience. #todo/nogaftemaken 

Note that a measuring stick might not be the right example for when a measuring stick (one that does not measure the length but the straightness of things) is bent, all things that are straight are not straight anymore (according to this stick) and some not-straight things become straight. In reality we see that those with imperfect moral standards do have some things correct, such as not killing and lying, but are wrong in other fields. Then again, the stick is a mere example so we do not have to hold on to it. 
On the other hand though, the stick does provide to be a good example, for we see that the slightest bend of the stick can make the stick to be almost touching the surface of some straight objects, but not exactly. The Left is clearly bent, but the Independents and those who are right of Center and left of Center seem to be very moral according to Judeo-Christian values. #tags/politics/abortion Pro-choicers, for example, are against murder in general, but they do allow the killing of babies. Some "Christians" want to spread the Gospel to all people of the LGBT-community, but they also allow them to keep their LGBT-identitity. #tags/lgbt So they are very close to Christian values, but just slightly off. See also the picture below.

Another example of why the measuring stick can be compared with the conscience is that it would not be wise to bend the stick to the other side too quickly in order to repair this. The stick would break, and so would one's conscience. And when one's conscience breaks, he needs to find out all over again what is trustworthy and what is not. 
So I think that is the reason why God, and Paul, do not want us to force anyone to go against his own conscience.

*8 Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do. 9 But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.*

Paul is speaking about the regular eating of food, not about fasting here. So whether we eat something or skip a meal because it contains meat (this cannot be called fasting), it does not bring us nearer to God. Fasting for a longer period, say at least a whole day, that would bring us closer to God given the right motivation. 
Also, note that we do have a right to eat. Whereas we do not have any rights at all as humans or as Christians, except for the right to live, provided that we are within the bounds of God's grace, eating is the only right that falls within this right to live. Even a roof over our head and clothes are not rights. For sure, these are not things we need to worry about (cf. Matthew 6:25-27), but whether we receive them is up to God. Food is our *only* right.
However, here too our right is confined by God's moral values or laws. Eating is lawful to us, but only when it is helpful, to both myself and my neighbor. When this is not the case, as in verse 10, then eating is not lawful, either in the field of *what* we eat or *whether* we eat. Paul is speaking of meat here, but if the whole meal consists of meat and vegetables (this would probably not be the case with Greek gods, but is more the case with Eastern "gods", such as within Hinduism and Buddhism) that have all been sacrificed to idols, then Paul would have skipped the whole meal, as should we. 

*10 For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol's temple, will he not be encouraged, if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols?*

v.10 indicates that the weaker brother has a tendency to eat food offered to idols. Suppose there is a brother who was not allowed to drink any alcohol in his previous life, for example as a Muslim. Now, when he has become a Christian, he still feels in his conscience that it is wrong to drink alcohol, although he knows that Christians are allowed to. So when he sees a brother doing this, he is inclined to think that he is sinful, but he knows that that is his conscience speaking to him. He is not ready to drink alcohol, because of his conscience, but he would probably not long for it either, because it is something bad in his mind. 
I think we can reason analogously with the weaker brother in this part who in his former life either was a Jew or Gentile and thus was not allowed to eat this kind of meat, or often did so and attended the rituals, respectively. The Jew would not be inclined, but rather abhorred by seeing his brothers eat meat, feeling as if they were defiling themselves. The Gentile, on the other hand, would remember his past and not have any problems eating this meat perse, but his conscience would speak against him in participating because he had just learned that he is not to worship other gods. So if anyone is encouraged to eat meat, merely by seeing a Christian doing this, it would rather be the Gentile brother than the Jewish brother. 

*11 And so ::by your knowledge:: this weak person is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died. 12 Thus, sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.* #todo/nogaftemaken waarom door iemands kennis verwoest? 

Now why would this *destroy* him and why would his conscience be *wounded* and why would Paul use such a serious word? Also, why would someone be destroyed by one's knowledge? How can knowledge ever hurt anyone? 
The Gentile brother still partially believed that these other gods existed (v.7) and did not ~have~ the concepts that (1) other idols do not really exist and (2) there is no God but one. 
On the one hand I understand when one mocks these gods by figuratively stepping on their graves and saying: "See? Nothing happened here." and proving that these idols are not really gods. A former worshipper of idols would perhaps feel slightly offended. Perhaps his feeling would be like that of a slave who went from one master to another. If his former master was good, but he decided to get "another job" he would #todo/opzoeken/engels like stabbing in the back, niet-comfortabel, maar niet spijt of zo, when his new "colleagues" so to speak would speak bad of his former master. If his former master was bad, this would somewhat lessen the negative feelings, but it would still be a form of disrespect or ::disloyalty::.
Perhaps loyalty is the keyword here. It is just like a dog who is loyal to his owner, regardless how bad the owner was. In the same way a person who was loyal to his idol went to great lengths to serve a new god now. If he needs to step on his old master it would go against his conscience and against his loyalty. 
However, that is only one part of the reason why this brother would have problems with eating meat, because it would still assume that this former master actually exists. This would mean that when he accepted Jesus Christ as his Savior he did not know or believe the whole story of Who God was. It is like someone who hears of the Gospel and accepted this, but knew nothing about six-day creation and the end-times. Gradually he would come to believe this and leave behind everything that does not match his belief system and thus leave behind the theory of natural evolution and all other false doctrines and ideologies imprinted in him during his former life. We also see this in proselytes—i.e. Gentiles who have come to faith—throughout the Old and New Testament such Ruth, Naaman and the Ethiopian eunuch, who all did not testify of disbelieving in other gods anymore, but only said that the Lord Yahweh is the One and only true God. 
As for how knowledge can affect anyone, it is not knowledge in itself, but the attitude with which we approach sensitive issues. Because of our knowledge we know something is good or wrong, which for another person could lie in the grey area, but also because of our knowledge we have become puffed up and forgotten about others' wellbeing, emotions and  conscience. So hence Paul says that it is our knowledge that destroyed others. 

So summarizing, the reason why this brother has problems eating meat is because he still believes other gods exist and also because he still has some loyalty to his former master. His loyalty to God, however, is greater and if God were to command something that goes against his former god, the brother would obey. Eating food offered to idols, however, is not a command, but something that is allowed. 
Perhaps this is also why Paul wrote "wounding their conscience *when it is weak*." I would conclude from this that Christians who still believe in the existence of other gods, and still have some loyalty towards them, have a weak conscience.

*13 Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.*

#personal/family/familytime/done/1corinthians Ask the children whether it is possible for someone to believe in God, to be a Christian, and still believe other gods exist? The answer is "yes", the only thing one needs to believe in order to be saved is the Gospel, which makes no mention of God being the only god, the Shema (the Trinity) or any issues concerning Israel, baptism and circumcision, Creation or the end-time.
