# Psalm 84
*Psalm 84:1-4 NIV*

*How lovely is your dwelling place, Lord Almighty! My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the Lord ; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her youngâ€” a place near your altar, Lord Almighty, my King and my God. Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they are ever praising you.*

I do not need a house before I can say that my house is a house of God. Your house is infinitely big. If I live with You I am already in Your house and dwelling with You.
Thank You for reminding me of this, Lord. Though I want to be able to say that my house is really a house of God, with Christians living in it from the first time it was built until today, now it is being rebuilt, and until the day it is destroyed, I know materials have no worth in Your sight.

The real house of God does not reside at one location, it can move, it can expand, it cannot be destroyed and only You can build it for it is not made with bricks and mortar but with heavenly love and grace.

*Psalm 84:5-7 NIV*

*Blessed are those whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage. As they pass through the Valley of Baka, they make it a place of springs;*

And Your house will spread out a scent wherever its inhabitants go to. It is immediately recognizable for people not living in Your house that Your house is the best place to be living in.

*the autumn rains also cover it with pools. They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion.*

Though rains seem like a curse in western countries, where they depict sadness, dreadfulness and boredom because one cannot go outside to enjoy the sun, in hot countries people rejoice and see rain as a blessing.
The same goes for your people, in some countries your people are seen as a curse, as something that goes against science. In other countries they are seen as a blessing, bringing forth wealth, stability in family and society and many other blessings such as medical aid and education.

*Psalm 84:8-9 NIV*

*Hear my prayer, Lord God Almighty; listen to me, God of Jacob. Look on our shield, O God; look with favor on your anointed one.*

TODO OPZOEKEN why does shield mean sovereign as well? A shield probably serves like sovereignty, it protects, but we do not have any sovereignty.

Yet hear us, O Lord, and protect us from the evil, who tries to tempt us every day. Warn us for his coming and let us be prepared, please. Teach us how to withstand the devil in every situation, by preparation and daily meditation.
And teach us perseverance, compassion and humbleness. But above all love.

*Psalm 84:10-11 NIV*

*Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.*

A famous key verse which I remember from one of Doug Fields' books. I think it's a good verse to start one's life with as a teenager.
As a teenager it is important to know your priorities, and to base priorities on their worth, their short term and long term worth.
In the end you will find out that everything will always lead to a decision, to choose or to not choose for God.
In my experience God's priorities are always top ranking ik worth, and usually in the long term. Quite often they do not seem intuitive, and sometimes even illogical. But one thing they always have in common, they are according to His Law, the Holy Word of God, that is the Bible.
So know your Bible well, and you will know what to choose at every important decision in life.

*For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless.*

What more would you need than God if He provides you with sun and protection?
The sun gives is brightness and shows us the way in life. It gives us life, food and even the water is cleansed by it, it streams to places through rivers to seas. It takes and gives life as is needed to keep the world in balance.
But not everything in nature is as pretty as it seems, we need protection from others and from ourselves.

*Psalm 84:12 NIV*

*Lord Almighty, blessed is the one who trusts in you.*

But *truly* blessed is the one who trusts in God. Why? Because He gives protection, which we cannot see, to things attacking us, which we cannot see as well. 
Real blessing is not in just knowing what we have been given, it is also in knowing what we have not been given, which could have harmed us.
Have you had luck yesterday? Have you had a *prevention* of *bad* luck yesterday? You do not know. Perhaps you would have tripped over something, but someone took something away that was lying on the ground.
