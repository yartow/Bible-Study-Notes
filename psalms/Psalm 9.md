# Psalm 9
*Psalm 9:1-6 NIV* 

*I will give thanks to you, Lord , with all my heart; I will tell of all your wonderful deeds. I will be glad and rejoice in you; I will sing the praises of your name, O Most High. My enemies turn back; they stumble and perish before you. For you have upheld my right and my cause, sitting enthroned as the righteous judge.*

Thank You, Lord, I want to praise You always and tell about the wonders You have done for me. You have done so much for me I can not even remember all of the things. You have done so many things, and such good things, that even my enemies will look up to me, at my success. If they do not know that it is because of You that I have this succes, I want to tell them about it.
You have held Your promise, You have protected me and kep the me in perfect peace, and I have trusted You. Perhaps not always, but You have forgiven me for that, and I thank You for that as well.

*You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; you have blotted out their name for ever and ever. Endless ruin has overtaken my enemies, you have uprooted their cities; even the memory of them has perished.*

You have helped me so much that I do not even have any enemies anymore, and if they are not destroyed it probably means I should not consider them as my enemies.

*The Lord reigns forever; he has established his throne for judgment. He rules the world in righteousness and judges the peoples with equity.*
*The Lord is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble. Those who know your name trust in you, for you, Lord, have never forsaken those who seek you. (Psalm 9:7-10 NIV)*

The only reason Gods throne is established, is because judgment is necessary at this moment. But He is righteous, which means He doesn't punish wrongly, but what does
Equity mean?

I know You can be trusted and that You are the only place people should run to when they are worn out or oppressed.
I trust in You, Lord, You have never forsaken me.

*Psalm 9:11-12 NIV*

*Sing the praises of the Lord , enthroned in Zion; proclaim among the nations what he has done. For he who avenges blood remembers; he does not ignore the cries of the afflicted.*

Thank You, Father, for listening to my prayers. Even though I expected something totally different, You led the conversation. I pray that you will lead Xiao's heart as well and give him wisdom.

*Psalm 9:13-18 NIV*

*Lord , see how my enemies persecute me! Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death, that I may declare your praises in the gates of Daughter Zion, and there rejoice in your salvation.*

Lord *,* if it were not for You I would have been dead already. But now that I have come near death, I can tell the world of Your love for me, Your sacrifice and the difference between death and life. 

*The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden. The Lord is known by his acts of justice; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands. The wicked go down to the realm of the dead, all the nations that forget God. But God will never forget the needy; the hope of the afflicted will never perish.*

I am glad to know You are by my side and that people can recognize You through Your good deeds, Your justice. I am also glad to know you will never forget me and that I can always put my hope in You. There are no conditions for You to love me, for me to call on You or to may have hope in You.

*Psalm 9:19-20 NIV*

*Arise, Lord , do not let mortals triumph; let the nations be judged in your presence. Strike them with terror, Lord ; let the nations know they are only mortal.*

That means, do not let me triumph either, David knew. Let my nation be judged, it even means.
Let me know and feel I am mortal, Lord, that I may not become arrogant and think I an do anything on my own. I need You, Lord, for even the smallest things.
