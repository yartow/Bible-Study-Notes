# Psalm 115
*Psalm 115:1 NIV*

*Not to us, Lord , not to us but to your name be the glory, because of your love and faithfulness.*

Too often we want to give ourselves glory. We think we have deserved it, because we have done some good things, or because we are good at some things.
First of all, doing good things does not compensate for all the bad things we have done. And if we are good at anything it is only because of grace that we have received this talent and the opportunity to train and use it.

*Psalm 115:2-8 NIV*

*Why do the nations say, “Where is their God?” Our God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him. But their idols are silver and gold, made by human hands. They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see. They have ears, but cannot hear, noses, but cannot smell. They have hands, but cannot feel, feet, but cannot walk, nor can they utter a sound with their throats.*

It is funny to see that other peoples are ridiculing us for having no God, while their own gods are made by themselves and cannot so anything at all.
Our God lives in heaven, theirs on Earth. Our God created us, they created their own.
Our God has given us senses and talents, their god does not have any of these.

As a practical implication for us, when we ridicule others, we should look at ourselves first.

*Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them.*

We make our idols because we want to be like them. We make a statue of the god of fertility, because we want to be fertile. We hang up posters of pop and movie stars, because we want to look as good and be as wealthy and famous as they are.
But that is not what God wants us to be like, He wants us to be like Christ.

*Psalm 115:9-11 NIV*

*All you Israelites, trust in the Lord — he is their help and shield. House of Aaron, trust in the Lord — he is their help and shield. You who fear him, trust in the Lord — he is their help and shield.*

The Lord is the help and shield of those who fear Him. He helps whole countries, tribes and families, and individuals. His shield is big enough to protect the world, but we must fear Him.

*Psalm 115:12-13 NIV*

*The Lord remembers us and will bless us: He will bless his people Israel, he will bless the house of Aaron, he will bless those who fear the Lord — small and great alike.*

Is the house of Aaron greater in number than the people of Israel? This is not possible, because everyone descending from Aaron is a Levite and a person of Israel himself.
But perhaps the point here is no matter what your heritage is

God will bless you, no matter whether your heritage is small or big, whether you come from a big or small family. The only thing that matters is whether you fear God.

*Psalm 115:14-15 NIV*

*May the Lord cause you to flourish, both you and your children. May you be blessed by the Lord , the Maker of heaven and earth.*

Who would not like to be blessed by the God Who created heaven and Earth. If He created such big and impossible, yet beautiful things, out of nothing, then how much more can He do with your life, which is created by him as well?
What is the best thing He can do with your life right now? The answer is, giving you a blessed life.

*Psalm 115:16-18 NIV*

*The highest heavens belong to the Lord , but the earth he has given to mankind. It is not the dead who praise the Lord , those who go down to the place of silence; it is we who extol the Lord , both now and forevermore. Praise the Lord .*

We are not dead but alive, and for a reason, to praise the Lord. So as long as I am alive, I must remember the reason why I am so, to extol the Lord!
We belong here on Earth to give glory to Him in all kinds of ways, to help other people and tell them about Him.
