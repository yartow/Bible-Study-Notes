# Psalm 5
*Listen to my words, Lord, consider my lament. Hear my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray. In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.* 

In the morning is when I want to hear Your voice, Lord, I want it to be the first thing on my mind every day. You give me peace and calmness in my life and especially on that day. And I want to have that every day.

*For you are not a God who is pleased with wickedness; with you, evil people are not welcome. The arrogant cannot stand in your presence.* ***You hate all who do wrong*** *; you destroy those who tell lies. The bloodthirsty and deceitful you, Lord, detest. But I, by your great love, can come into your house; in reverence I bow down toward your holy temple. (Psalm 5:1-7 NIV)* 

Would that mean you hate me too? Or is this for those who *continue to do wrong and do not ask for forgiveness*? 
Perhaps I should have underlined the word *all* since it is not about hating, but about the fact that You make no exceptions as You have written in Romans [3:23](). 

All of those, I am. I have told lies, and still do. I have been bloodthirsty and deceitful. So I know it is not of my person, but because of Your great love that I can come into Your house.
In reverence I bow down toward Your holy temple, but in reverence I also dare not touch it or do anything in it, afraid of doing anything wrong. How can I be of service in Your Church when everything I do is unholy and unworthy of the respect You deserve? My thoughts are still sinful and my actions hopefully not, but probably are just as well.
I know, though, that You will accept my imperfect gifts and offers and accept them as perfect. For Your love is abundant, oh Lord, and You give abundantly, always enough, never too little, for me to keep on going.

*Psalm 5:8-12 NIV* 

*Lead me, Lord , in your righteousness because of my enemiesâ€” make your way straight before me. Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; their heart is filled with malice. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongues they tell lies. Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall. Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you. But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you. Surely, Lord , you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield.* 

The many times you have saved me in my life, from making the wrong decisions that would have influenced the rest of my life, are prevented by You, Lord. You have shown me so many favors, what did I do to deserve that? It must be because You see something special in me. Something that needed protection, and with these favors You have protected me.
The many times when I almost did something wrong, I thought of Your love for me and the good things You had done. I thought, *the Lord has spent so much effort in me, I cannot let Him down*.
