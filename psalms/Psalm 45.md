# Psalm 45
*Psalm 45:1-2 NIV*

*My heart is stirred by a noble theme as I recite my verses for the king;*

This theme is given to you by God Himself. Inspiration cannot be created.

*my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.*

A fine tongue can be your gift, the gift of speech, of poetry, communication that can bring others closer to God. David definitely had this by reciting the Psalms.
A tongue can be a weapon, both for defense and offense. Use it against the satan!

*You are the most excellent of men and your lips have been anointed with grace, since God has blessed you forever.*

David is saying that even though his tongue is skilled, it still cannot compare with Jesus, whose lips are blessed by God FOREVER!
That is what I should aim for. Not a temporary blessing, not for a certain situation, not for a lifetime, but for eternity.
Summarizing, ask for something
* for eternity,
* something that can worship and praise God and
* bring others to God
* Something to attack the devil and
* Defend yourself with

*Psalm 45:3-4 NIV*

*Gird your sword on your side, you mighty one; clothe yourself with splendor and majesty.*
*In your majesty ride forth victoriously in the cause of truth, humility and justice; let your right hand achieve awesome deeds.*

This is not about me. It is the King, that is Jesus, Whom David is asking to clothe Himself with splendor and majesty.

I need to learn to give up my honor, and know that all honor goes to God alone.

Jesus rides with three things, truth, humility and justice. He is the embodiment of those three things. I am not, therefore I do not deserve such honor.

When have I lied? Perhaps today, counting the tiny lies. When was I not humble? Today as well, feeling proud, looking down on others, even if only in my mind for a few seconds.
When was I not just? Today, for judging someone by their looks.

*Psalm 45:5-9 NIV*

*Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s enemies;*
*let the nations fall beneath your feet.*
*Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever;*
*a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.*

Justice will be the main pillar in God's Kingdom. Not love? Of course love will be the main reason for everything, but perhaps that is not described as a scepter. A scepter is made for ruling.

*You love righteousness and hate wickedness;*
*therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.*

Another reference to Christ and the Trinity.

All your robes are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia; from palaces adorned with ivory the music of the strings makes you glad.
Daughters of kings are among your honored women; at your right hand is the royal bride in gold of Ophir.

Honored women, this probably does not indicate spouses, but the women who serve the Lord, like Rahab, Ruth and Esther.

*Psalm 45:10-11 NIV*

*Listen, daughter, and pay careful attention: Forget your people and your father’s house. Let the king be enthralled by your beauty; honor him, for he is your lord.*

I think I know why David wrote this and why God let him write this. Women are so beautiful, even if they do not realize, and most often they do not realize because the world tells them they are not.
The world defines beauty only by outer appearance, but what about character and the fruit of the Spirit? That is what makes a woman attractive.
Women should not serve the world, but serve the Lord. Then they will receive what they really deserve.

*Psalm 45:12-15 NIV*

*The city of Tyre will come with a gift, people of wealth will seek your favor.*
*All glorious is the princess within her chamber;*
*her gown is interwoven with gold.*
*In embroidered garments she is led to the king;*
*her virgin companions follow her— those brought to be with her.*
*Led in with joy and gladness, they enter the palace of the king.*

If a person or a woman in this case, has a a heart of gold on the inside, she will attract gold on the outside.

*Psalm 45:16 NIV*

*Your sons will take the place of your fathers; you will make them princes throughout the land.*

About whose sons is David writing? And whose fathers?
Does this mean that God's children will be kings, in the New World?

*Psalm 45:17 NIV*

*I will perpetuate your memory through all generations; therefore the nations will praise you for ever and ever.*

David is a king himself and he has the power to bring God's message to his people. He will make sure the people will always remember God.
So far David has not failed, although it is by the power of God.
However, it still saddens me to know there are so many Jews who do not even care about being Jewish and leave a very bad reputation for Jewish people.
