# Psalm 111
*Psalm 111:1-5 NIV*

*Praise the Lord .*

*I* *will extol the Lord with all my heart in the council of the upright and in the assembly.*

The best place to praise the Lord is with other members of the body, praise Him together and let our praise be reflected and resonated by others.
Would it help to praise Him in front of the unrighteous? Not if they trample and mock your praise.

*Great are the works of the Lord ; they are pondered by all who delight in them.*
 
Those who really delight in the works of the Lord will ponder them. There cannot be enough beauty in everything that God has created. A single flower contains so much beauty, from the whole plant until its cells, from the process of
Ontkiemen
To mating.
Scientists have created theories just by looking at God's creation. There are perhaps millions of laws and theories from plants alone. Gravity and quantum physics are all present within the plant.

*Glorious and majestic are his deeds, and his righteousness endures forever. He has caused his wonders to be remembered; the Lord is gracious and compassionate. He provides food for those who fear him; he remembers his covenant forever.*

Whatever God does, are no small things. His footprint of righteousness is one that endures forever.
People remember God, or His works, because He *causes* them to remember. He causes it by creating a work so fine so detailed. Even if it is not material, the plan surrounding it is so thought out, nothing could ruin His plan, everything fits together like a puzzle. 
Not only because of the magnificence of His plan but also because of the love within it. For the Lord is gracious and compassionate, His plans are always for the better of His people. He takes care of them and He remembers His covenant.

*Psalm 111:6-9 NIV*

*He has shown his people the power of his works, giving them the lands of other nations.*

God showed His people what He was capable of. He let Israel defeat all countries surrounding the Holy Land. The only times countries were not defeated, was because the people did not only the Lord.
This means that God could let any country defeat Israel as well. Israel was only saved by mercy.

*The works of his hands are faithful and just; all his precepts are trustworthy.*

What God has done is just. The surrounding countries needed to be defeated, not only because God promised to, but because of His command as well, because the surrounding countries were worshipping other gods, idols made of wood, which is not allowed. They deserved to be punished and exterminated.

*They are established for ever and ever, enacted in faithfulness and uprightness. He provided redemption for his people; he ordained his covenant foreverâ€” holy and awesome is his name.*

They refers to His precepts, which is written only once and stays forever that way. Nothing ever changes. What was just, is just even now and in the future. The same goes for faithfulness and uprightness.
And so His covenant with His people, the Israelites is forever, which means it is still valid. Once the Israelites give themselves to God, they will be greatly blessed in this world, known throughout this world. There is only a small number of Jews and yet they are already known in almost every country at the highest ranks.
God's Name is holy, and He shows it by keeping His covenant, even while the Jews do not. How much more blessings would they receive when they do give their hearts to Him?

*Psalm 111:10 NIV*

*The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow his precepts have good understanding. To him belongs eternal praise.*

Wisdom has to do with understanding, whether you understand a person or a situation can change the entire outcome.
How can I get wisdom? By fearing God. And how can I do that? By following His precepts.
