# Psalm 73
*Psalm 73:1-3 NIV*

*Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.*

*But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold. For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.*

It almost happened that Asaph would have turned bad, even in his heart. For he envied, but fortunately he did not go any step further.
Asaph phrases it very well: *I had nearly lost my* ~*foothold*~. In this case the foothold is not our foundation, but the road we are waking on, as well as God's laws. When we slip from it, by definition we are not walking anymore on God's laws. 

*Psalm 73:4-6 NIV*

*They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong. They are free from common human burdens; they are not plagued by human ills. Therefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence.*

This all seems to be true, for we can not look into the future. But looking backwards we know that the arrogant and wicked will always be punished and lead a life with sadness, without peace.

*Psalm 73:6-11 NIV*

*From their callous hearts comes iniquity ; their evil imaginations have no limits. They scoff, and speak with malice; with arrogance they threaten oppression. Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth. Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance.*
*They say, “How would God know? Does the Most High know anything?”*

The arrogance of those people sparks off of this description. Anything they can mock or defile they do. Every part of their body is dedicated to evil, their heart, imagination, eyes, mouth, tongue.
They lay claim of everything, earth, heaven and waters, while they do not even know half of this world, the depths of the seas nor even a bit of heaven.
Mostly, they do not know about God at all and say the most ridiculous thing: *Does the Most High know anything?*! 

*Psalm 73:12 NIV*

*This is what the wicked are like— always free of care, they go on amassing wealth.*

Do not be fooled by what you see.

*Psalm 73:13-17 NIV*

*Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and have washed my hands in innocence. All day long I have been afflicted, and every morning brings new punishments.*

Many of us have experienced this, the feeling that all others, bad people are blessed, while we, the good ones are blessed with bad luck. But most of us do not know we have perseverance because this, we know appreciate everything that is good much more than the bad people.

But thanks to God, my Lord, for those who have not thought of it as being vain. For those who did think so must have been tempted to not wash their hands in innocence anymore.
And thanks even more to those who kept their hands clean.

*If I had spoken out like that, I would have betrayed your children. When I tried to understand all this, it troubled me deeply till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny.*

I expected to read in the last line *my destiny* instead of *theirs*. It can be understood as that people usually are not persuaded or motivated by their own destiny, but by others. 

*Psalm 73:18-20 NIV*

*Surely you place them on slippery ground; you cast them down to ruin. How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors! They are like a dream when one awakes; when you arise, Lord, you will despise them as fantasies.*

I must not forget that you place the wicked on slippery ground, just a wrong movement may make them fall. To God they are like this air, I just have to go along with God's time.

*Psalm 73:21-22 NIV*

*When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered, I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before you.*

When I was young, simple things as materials and popularity, things that are so unimportant now but back then they seemed so big, could make me bitter and senseless. I was selfish and thought that I was the only one that mattered, that the whole world turned about me.
Even more, I was ignorant, not because of my ignorance, but I already was. I did not know how much You loved me and how everything was given by You in order to protect me, to let me persevere, to let me grow in understanding of Your love and others' feelings.

*Psalm 73:23-26 NIV*

*Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.*

Not You with me, but I with You. One could interpret this as *wherever I go, I will still be where You are, for You have been leading me all the time*. 

*You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory.*

For anyone who wonders what life is, it is as easy as this: we are guided by God and afterward taken into *His* glory. I have added *His* because not only do we become glory for Him, by discarding all of our mortal and sinful nature and flesh, but also will we be in *His* presence, which is nothing but glory. 

*Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you.*

The only reason I would want to stay on Earth, knowing that everything on Earth is idleness, is because I can find a bit of God here by loving my neighbors. Seeing my brothers and sisters in Christ acting out God's love, shows me a call little bit of God. That is what I can live for.

*My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.*

God protects my heart, for what I want would have changed by the day if God did not help me make my heart steadfast.
He protects my portion, for without His protection I would have bet all of my portion and even more and lost it to the devil.
Everything I have, is from His grace. Everything I have so-called won, falls amazingly short with the debt I have.

*Psalm 73:27-28 NIV*

*Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you. But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign Lord my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds.*

When I am near You, I know you are helping me to be faithful to You. Far from You I would indeed perish.
You are my refuge and protect me from my enemies and myself. There is nothing I could do to lead myself, but You, o Lord, have led me out of the wilderness, out of the world I imagined was safe and where I was king, to realize that I am nothing but a slave, a servant, incapable of anything.
You became my Master and showed me that I am capable of loving others and in doing so, serving others, and giving glory to You.
