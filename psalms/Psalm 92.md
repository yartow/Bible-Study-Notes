# Psalm 92
*Psalm 92:1-3 NIV*

*It is good to praise the Lord and make music to your name, O Most High, proclaiming your love in the morning and your faithfulness at night, to the music of the ten-stringed lyre and the melody of the harp.*

Indeed, there is nothing so refreshing as praising the Lord in the morning, proclaiming (and that includes thinking of all of your) love and faithfulness. This makes me forget about myself completely, forget about how "good" I am at certain things, because all of it vanishes when comparing myself to You, and also considering Your greatness, for all I have is given by You. Rather I can see all of my iniquities and shortcomings, which makes me praise Him all the more, because the more shortcomings I have, the more I see He has forgiven me and given me.

*Psalm 92:4-7 NIV*

*For you make me glad by your deeds, Lord ; I sing for joy at what your hands have done.*

Singing and music are of main importance. You not only forgive us our sins, and give us talents to work for you (ref. Col 2:10, 2 Tim 3:17), but You also give us inspiration. With our musical talent we can write music and think of musical works to express Your greatness. And with our other talents we think of new ways to help You build Your Kingdom (though it is You Who are building it).

*How great are your works, Lord , how profound your thoughts! Senseless people do not know, fools do not understand, that though the wicked spring up like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be destroyed forever.*

It takes a long time before the wicked are eradicated, but it takes only a night before new wicked people spring up. How can we win this fight against the Satan, oh Lord? And how can we fight the wicked, if You want them to be Your children?
Only You can provide the answer, for You are God Almighty.

*Psalm 92:8 NIV*

*But you, Lord , are forever exalted.*

If those wicked people and evildoers only knew You were **forever exalted** *, they would not be who they are right now or do what they do right now.*
They would know You outlast them and in the end You alone survive.

*Psalm 92:9-11 NIV*

*For surely your enemies, Lord , surely your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered. You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; fine oils have been poured on me. My eyes have seen the defeat of my adversaries; my ears have heard the rout of my wicked foes.*

Moses already knows his adversaries will be defeated by You, he knows it so well that he has already seen and his ears have already heard it. Perhaps You have shown it to him already, or told him.
Either way, it is true that You have made the people of Israel strong. I only wish they would realize that. All of their talents, their popularity and influence in the world, their reputation and intelligence.

*Psalm 92:12-15 NIV*

*The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon; planted in the house of the Lord , they will flourish in the courts of our God. They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh and green, proclaiming, “The Lord is upright; he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him.”*

Everything Moses says here about You is correct. In all these years You have not changed, and You still keep Your promises. It really pays off to be righteous. The reward we receive from You is much greater than any other reward brought by this world.

We will not only grow like cedars, magnificent trees with the best quality of wood, but also will we be planted in the court of the Lord.
And not only that, but we will also live to be old, and old alone, but also bearing fruit at an old age
Even at this age people will say, *the Lord is upright, there is no wickedness in Him*. 
That alone is a promise worth so much. Just knowing that God will be with you until the end and still love Him, or even more than you do now, and hearing the testimonies of those who have experienced it.
I wish to experience it as well, my Lord. I know You are putting me in a trial right now and I need Your help to get through this.
Show me Your wonders, Lord, not that I do not I believe before I see, but let me boast again in my weaknesses and in Your power.
