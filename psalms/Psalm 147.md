# Psalm 147
*Praise the Lord .*
*How good it is to sing praises to our God, how pleasant and fitting to praise him!*

No one is more fitting of our praises than the Lord our God. We were made especially to praise Him. Of course, to have a relationship with Him in the first place, but in this relationship we would praise Him, for there is no possibility that one can know God and not praise Him.

*The Lord builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the exiles of Israel. He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.*

The Lord builds great things like Jerusalem and He heals small things, like us.

*He determines the number of the stars and calls them each by name.*

God knows each of us and all of our hurts, even our suppressed hurts that lie in the past. If there is anyone Who can understand, it is God, for He became man Himself in order to feel our pains at the cross.

*Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has no limit. The Lord sustains the humble but casts the wicked to the ground.*
*Psalm 147:1-6 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.147.1-6.NIV*

He not only knows all things but He understands it all and cares about all as well. He treats one accordingly, the humble and the wicked will get what they deserve.

*Sing to the Lord with grateful praise; make music to our God on the harp. He covers the sky with clouds; he supplies the earth with rain and makes grass grow on the hills. He provides food for the cattle and for the young ravens when they call.*
*Psalm 147:7-9 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.147.7-9.NIV*

God has given us music to use it to sing to Him. He has given us clouds to supply us with food and to show us how much He cares. Every drop from the sky is a blessing.

*His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, nor his delight in the legs of the warrior; the Lord delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love.*

TODO key verses
It is long known that the Lord does not look at the outside, but at the inside of people. He does not care about all the money and fame you have, for He was the One who gave it to you. Neither does He care about Your strength, for He can take it away just as easily.
No, He rather delights in those who fear Him, who recognize the almight of the Lord, His strength and His power. But not only that, they must put their hope in Him as well.

*Extol the Lord , Jerusalem; praise your God, Zion. He strengthens the bars of your gates and blesses your people within you. He grants peace to your borders and satisfies you with the finest of wheat.*
*Psalm 147:10-14 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.147.10-14.NIV*

It is unimaginable what God does for us, if it is described in human words, it is like this verse above. God's blessings are like a chain reaction going from you to other people while at the same time strengthening the bars of our gates, that is making our defense stronger against the Satan.
Even more follows in the verse. When we out our hope and trust in the Lord, we will enjoy peace with others and be satisfied to a level that only few can enjoy. The gift of being able to taste the difference between a two star and three star Michelin restaurant, is rare, but when you are able to do so, your enjoyment is much higher.
So it is with the finest wheat here. We will enjoy the gifts of God up to an exquisite level. Just like some might find there is no difference between the enjoyment of God or of the world, or cannot see the enjoyment at all (they see persecution as something bad, while we have joy through our persecutions).

When we trust in God, we grow, and with this growing we become stronger against attacks, and more peace-loving.

*He sends his command to the earth; his word runs swiftly. He spreads the snow like wool and scatters the frost like ashes. He hurls down his hail like pebbles. Who can withstand his icy blast? He sends his word and melts them; he stirs up his breezes, and the waters flow.*
*Psalm 147:15-18 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.147.15-18.NIV*

With one single command God can spread and send every snowflake to where it must go to. Nothing can stop it, but God can, with one word, melt everything and let it all flow away.

*He has revealed his word to Jacob,*
*his laws and decrees to Israel.*
*20 He has done this for no other nation;*
*they do not know his laws.[b]*
*Praise the Lord.*

The Lord has not given His precious Laws to other nations as they would trample over it or even be saved. The Lord our God is sovereign and has His reasons for not saving everyone.

I praise the Lord for He knows what is best, what the best timing is and who to share His Law with.
Praise the Lord for giving us His Law.
