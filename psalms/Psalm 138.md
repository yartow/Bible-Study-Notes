# Psalm 138
*1 I will praise you, Lord, with all my heart;*
*before the “gods” I will sing your praise.*

I cannot say it any better than Spurgeon has already done. Why would I let idols rob God even one second of my praise to Him? David thought so as well and amidst the idolatry in his country, though not visible per se, or even the idolatry of the neighboring countries, David continues worshiping God.

*2 I will bow down toward your holy temple*
*and will praise your name*
*for your unfailing love and your faithfulness,*

Your love is unfailing, unlike mine, which is so easily diminished as soon as the person does not love me back. That is why I will praise Your holy Name. There is none like You, nowhere in this world have I seen a love greater than Yours.

*for you have so exalted your solemn decree*
*that it surpasses your fame.*

In the King James version we see this translation

*For thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.*

which is quite different from the NIV but just a little different from the Dutch SV.
When looking at God's Word we see that everything depends on it. Every command, blessing and promise has been made by His Word, as well as everything that has been created.
And of all created things, the Word incarnate is at the top of those.

*3 When I called, you answered me;*
*you greatly emboldened me.*

You are the same God as ages ago, the same God David is writing about. I can recognize how he describes You. You answer, not always in words, but in strength as well. Or it is that I hear from You, with some kind of feeling of peace in my heart and mind, and I suddenly have the strength to do it.

*May all the kings of the earth praise you, Lord , when they hear what you have decreed. May they sing of the ways of the Lord , for the glory of the Lord is great.*
*Psalm 138:4-5 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.138.4-5.NIV*

Indeed, I hope that all the kings of the earth will first of all, understand Your decrees, and then know You have issued those decrees, and then praise You for having written such beautiful decrees.
Your way is great, Your glory is great. There is none who can receive more glory than You. No one can think of a way, I a law, more perfect than Yours.

*6 Though the Lord is exalted, he looks kindly on the lowly;*
*though lofty, he sees them from afar.*

One thing I can learn from the Lord is to look kindly on the lowly, on all the lowly people, whether it is in money, status, jobs, spiritual health and growth, intelligence. I *have* to do that. 
As for the lofty people, like I, or at least those who *think* they are lofty, God sees right through them. I cannot hide my hypocritical attitude towards the lowly. But I know it is bad and I know God can change it. 

*7* *Though I walk in the midst of trouble,*
*you preserve my life.*
*You stretch out your hand against the anger of*
*my foes;*
*with your right hand you save me.*

I have made things real bad in this life, though You have warned me, I have walked right into the midst of trouble. Trouble friends, lusts and careers, all for the sake of worldly things. But You have preserved my life.
I really am not worth saving, but You still did it, not just once, but all the time, from my time as a undergraduate until now and even still. I was not even with to be called, but that too You allowed me to hear.
I have made many foes in those times, and still do, both on the enemy's side as well as on Your side, when I sinned against Your own body. But then You saved me as well.

*8* *The Lord will vindicate me;*
*your love, Lord, endures forever—*
*do not abandon the works of your hands.*

But all the wrong that has been done to me as well, by the Satan and all his attempts to seduce me, I know that You will vindicate me. You will take Your revenge on the Satan and let him suffer for what he has done to Your people.

Lord, You have put so much effort in me to let me become what I am, with all my faults and learnings, but I want to serve You. Do not abandon me, Your work of Your hands. Let me be ever valuable to You and the building of Your Kingdom. Do not let the Satan take that away from me.
