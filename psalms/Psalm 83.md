# Psalm 83
*Psalm 83:1-4 NIV*

*O God, do not remain silent; do not turn a deaf ear, do not stand aloof, O God. See how your enemies growl, how your foes rear their heads. With cunning they conspire against your people; they plot against those you cherish. “Come,” they say, “let us destroy them as a nation, so that Israel’s name is remembered no more.”*

All other nations are surrounding me and planning on destroying me. That is because You are God Almighty, and You are the enemy of their god, the Satan, and because we are Your children, they want to attack us as well.

Help us I'm this situation, Lord, only You can relieve us of this pain and accusing of wrongdoing. Only you can give new life and new hope.
We ask You to give it to us.

*Psalm 83:5-8 NIV*

*With one mind they plot together; they form an alliance against you— the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites, Byblos, Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the people of Tyre. Even Assyria has joined them to reinforce Lot’s descendants.*

All nations are against us, there is no one to help us out, and even if there is one, they do not acknowledge You, Lord Jesus.
Even Lot's descendants, family of Abraham himself, are now our enemies.

*Psalm 83:9-16 NIV*

*Do to them as you did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became like dung on the ground. Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, who said, “Let us take possession of the pasturelands of God.”*

All of these names are unfamiliar to me, but one thing they have in common, and that is that they wanted to take what was God's.

*Make them like tumbleweed, my God, like chaff before the wind. As fire consumes the forest or a flame sets the mountains ablaze, so pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm.*

Do to them what they deserve, Lord, if they need to disappear forever, as if no one has ever known them, like the Assyrians which no one knew existed until a few years ago, then do so, my Lord. Then let them be like chaff in the wind.
One flame can burn an entire forest, and one flame of Yours can make an entire nation disappear from history. You have shown this with the Assyrians, the city of Nineveh and even the Egyptians, though no one in science believes that that has happened.

*Cover their faces with shame, Lord , so that they will seek your name.*

If they need to be ashamed before they will seek Your Name, then do so, Lord.
I do not care about what the world thinks, only what You deem is right, is truly right.

*Psalm 83:17-18 NIV*

*May they ever be ashamed and dismayed; may they perish in disgrace. Let them know that you, whose name is the Lord — that you alone are the Most High over all the earth.*
