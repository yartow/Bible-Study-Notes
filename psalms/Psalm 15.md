# Psalm 15
*Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent? Who may live on your holy mountain? The one whose walk is blameless, who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from their heart; (Psalm 15:1, 2 NIV)*

In fact it is not so hard or impossible to be blameless or righteous. If you try hard enough, you will always notice there are certain moments in life when you get to decide what to do. Doing unrighteous acts, do not just cross your life. You always get to decide what to do.
As long as you have done your best, and regret the wrong decisions you have made and do not make them again, you are the one whose walk is blameless, righteous, and truthful.

*Psalm 15:3-5 NIV*

*whose tongue utters no slander, who does no wrong to a neighbor, and casts no slur on others; who despises a vile person but honors those who fear the Lord ;*

Now this is the hard part. Whereas the part above involves decisions to *make*, these are words that need to be withheld. Words might come out of your mouth even if you didn't want to. Even if you wanted to put it nicely, it could come out different by your tone. 

*who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and does not change their mind; who lends money to the poor without interest; who does not accept a bribe against the innocent. Whoever does these things will never be shaken.*

But there is even a harder part. The two parts above were about hurting others, This part is about not hurting others and letting yourself get hurt. You have kept an oath, and no matter what the other side does, you need to keep your oath. You lend money to the poor without interest, which means that in a way you are losing money.

*Whoever does these things will never be shaken.*

Though it seems almost impossible to do all of these things, it is possible with God's help and power.
