# Psalm 40
*Psalm 40:1-3 NIV*

*I waited patiently for the Lord ; he turned to me and heard my cry. He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire;*
*he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.*

I do not know exact when, but from a certain moment in my life, I felt like I could not fall anymore. Nothing would hurt me, I feared nothing and my trust in the Lord was as great as it could be at that age. Of course this trust has grown even more, as the Spirit grows within me, but it really was as if I had always drifted on water and now I was standing on solid rock bottom.

I still am standing there, I know.

*He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God.*
*Many will see and fear the Lord and put their trust in him.*

Wait patiently, is what I am getting from this verse.
Inspiration comes from the Lord and His gift to us can be a song for Him.

A song which reminds us of the many deeds He has done for us, and every time we sing it it, we remember that God is good and Almighty, and has conquered all evil. Nothing is too difficult for Him to solve.
This gives us hope and therefore it is a gift for us as well.

*Psalm 40:4-5 NIV*

*Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord , who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods.*

Blessed is the one who *trusts* in the Lord. Not someone who receives something or whatever he possesses, but what he *does*. 
Because *doing* the right thing will lead to the right consequence. 

*Many, Lord my God, are the wonders you have done, the things you planned for us.*
*None can compare with you; were I to speak and tell of your deeds, they would be too many to declare.*

Indeed, You have done so many things I cannot even remember. But I do remember Your love for me, Your sacrificial love, and the pain You feel, every time I am hurting You.
Please forgive me, Lord.

*Psalm 40:6-8 NIV*

*Sacrifice and offering you did not desire— but my ears you have opened — burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.*

You have already given the biggest sacrifice there is, nothing can add to that and nothing can add any peace to that.
Even more, You have given me the greatest gift *next* to the sacrifice of Your Son Jesus Christ, which is my body. 
You have made me alive and existing in this world, You have let me know that there is more in this world than just seventy years, You have even made me realize that I belong to You and given me the chance to know You. For that I am utterly grateful, it is more than I could ever wish for.

*Then I said, “Here I am, I have come— it is written about me in the scroll.*

Many things David writes in the Psalms, but not only the Psalms, seem like they were meant for me. And not just that, but even meant for me at this very day or moment.

*I desire to do your will, my God; your law is within my heart.”*

Indeed, that is why I feel so bad and have slept so badly, because what I am doing is wrong.
Forgive me, Lord, and help me fix this if it is Your will.

*Psalm 40:9-10 NIV*

*I proclaim your saving acts in the great assembly;*
*I do not seal my lips, Lord , as you know.*
*I do not hide your righteousness in my heart;*
I have spoken of your command for us to be righteous, but I have not spoken of the righteousness you have given us.
Your saving acts as well, I should remember and *proclaim*! 

*I speak of your faithfulness and your saving help.*
*I do not conceal your love and your faithfulness from the great assembly.*

I have been wrong, Lord, thank You for showing me. I have not spoken of all these things yet.

Psalm 40:11-13 NIV

*Do not withhold your mercy from me, Lord ; may your love and faithfulness always protect me.*
*For troubles without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see.*

Through all my troubles and worries I cannot see how much You are helping me. If you are not here beside me, I would have died already, failed miserably at every task ever been given by You. But You are merciful, Lord, You have forgiven me all my mistakes and led me along the way.
You stil are leading me and I need to know that, there will not ever be a moment in life where I will not need You anymore, I will always be Your child, and You will be my Father, and Teacher and Protector.

*They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails within me.*
*Be pleased to save me, Lord ;*
*come quickly, Lord , to help me.*

My heart was never that strong, it has always failed me. It has always been your power that saved me with courage and strength.
I ask You now once more, Lord, please rescue me, and give me strength, to lead the people You have placed in front of me, to lead the projects in church even when there seems to be no hope.

*Psalm 40:14-16 NIV*

*May all who want to take my life be put to shame and confusion;*
*may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.*
*May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” be appalled at their own shame.*
*But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you;*
*may those who long for your saving help always say, “The Lord is great!”*

I still find it hard to call out a "curse" such as this one.
TODO Is it righteous to say something like this, even though you leave the punishment to God?

It seems like this paragraph is repeated somewhere else in the Psalms. Still, the meaning is just as important, only those who are able to say, the Lord is great, have experienced God's greatness.

*Psalm 40:17 NIV*

*But as for me, I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me.*
*You are my help and my deliverer; you are my God, do not delay.*
Though David was not poor, he still makes a remark like this. Does it mean that David means this figuratively? He does not think about his wealth and his worldly power, because he knows that everything was given to him by God, he was merely a steward.
A steward in charge of a house would not consider himself rich and wealthy. David knew this, perhaps his kingdom had been taken from him by his own son and own men already at the time of writing, in that case he really was poor and needy.

In any case it is always a wise thing to realize we are not rich or wealthy. We are merely stewards and we are always needy of God's help and strength.
Help us, Father, in the first place to keep realizing we are stewards here on earth and that we are strangers here on earth.
For our treasures are in heaven.
