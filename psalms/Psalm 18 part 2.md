# Psalm 18 part 2
The Lord lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God my Savior!
He is the God who avenges me, who subdues nations under me, who saves me from my enemies.
You exalted me above my foes; from a violent man you rescued me.

Once more, God does not only save, He does more than that, He gives us honor and puts us above our foes.

Therefore I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; I will sing the praises of your name. (Psalm 18:46-49 NIV)

He does so much for us, and all we do is sing for Him and praise Him. But that is enough, because He accepts our worship and He does not need our help.
