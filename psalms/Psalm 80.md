# Psalm 80
*Psalm 80:1-2 NIV*

*Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock. You who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh. Awaken your might; come and save us.*

Why would Asaph only write down these three provinces or peoples? Because the center of Israel is exactly between these three provinces? Why mention Benjamin if that is a part of Manasseh already?

*Psalm 80:3 NIV*

*Restore us, O God; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved.*

We need restoration, only when You are willing to look at us, maybe be saved.

*Psalm 80:4-6 NIV*

*How long, Lord God Almighty, will your anger smolder against the prayers of your people? You have fed them with the bread of tears; you have made them drink tears by the bowlful. You have made us an object of derision* *to our neighbors, and our enemies mock us.*

Your anger has been going on for a while. The last of it, we hope, is happening now. You want us to cry, to know what we have been doing wrong, and You want us to taste and drink up Your tears, so that we will know what You are feeling, the pain we are causing You.

*Psalm 80:8-11 NIV*

*You transplanted a vine from Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.*

Father, our roots were laid in Egypt, the first country where had a home. We were treated well in the beginning, but no more in the end.
You knew what to do, You punished the Egyptians for treating Your people like this, You let us endure suffering until we called upon You, and it took a while, I think, before we called You.
You gave us something better instead, something You had promised to our forefather, to Abraham, and You held Your promise.
You transplanted us, root and all, not forgetting a single one, and even with the fruit of Egypt hanging, that is gold.

*You cleared the ground for it,*

But before You did that, You cleared the new country. It was a given fact that other peoples would lose a war with us, because You had already given us the land. We just had to take it.

*and it took root and filled the land. The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches. Its branches reached as far as the Sea, its shoots as far as the River.*

You let us flourish, fill the land, from the sea unto the river.

*Psalm 80:12-15 NIV*

*Why have you broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its grapes? Boars from the forest ravage it, and insects from the fields feed on it.*

Was it really You Who broke down the walls of Israel? No, we did it ourselves. We did not consult the One Who built the wall in the first place, we did not follow His orders, we did not maintain our walls and we slacked off even when the first enemies arrived.
Boars are non kosher and should be avoided all along, so even when the first one came, we should have been alert that many were to come as well. As for insects, we should have known all that is written about it in Exodus.

**Return to us, God Almighty! Look down from heaven and see! Watch over this vine, the root your right hand has planted, the son you have raised up for yourself.**

We regret our actions, Lord, please forgive us. Forgive me for what I have done, for not warning my neighbors, my brothers and sisters, for all this knowledge that I have not used in the right way.
Protect this branch of Yours, I know You have many other branches, but we ask You not to forget us.

*Psalm 80:16-18 NIV*

*Your vine is cut down, it is burned with fire; at your rebuke your people perish. Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand, the son of man you have raised up for yourself. Then we will not turn away from you; revive us, and we will call on your name.*

Are you referring to Your Son, Jesus Christ, now?
Are the Israelites saying that if the Messiah comes, they will stop sinning?
That is very strange to understand. They cannot pose conditions for when they will stop sinning, they should do it right now.
