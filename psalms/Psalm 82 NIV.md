# Psalm 82 NIV
*Psalm 82:1-4 NIV*

*God presides in the great assembly; he renders judgment among the “gods”:*

God of course does not literally preside in an assembly, He does not need agreement from anyone to do what He wants to. No god sits next to Him, and every god, if there were to exist one, would seem human next to the godliness of our great God.
Even the "gods" await judgement from God, they fear Him just as much as we do and know that their powers are nothing and worthless.

*“How long will you defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked? Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed. Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.*

This verse shows that the weak and fatherless, poor and oppressed, and the needy (where weak is repeated) are "poetically sandwiched" between the unjust and the wicked (twice).

It shows me how I must care for the weak and protect them against the wicked.
I always believed one should be strong and stand up for oneself, but one cannot help that he is fatherless, poor or oppressed, or all three at the same time.
God gave me strength so I could protect the weak.
If I do not help the weak, I am just as bad as the wicked.

*Psalm 82:5 NIV*

*“The ‘gods’ know nothing, they understand nothing. They walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.*

I understood nothing, and I probably still do not understand a lot. But the gods of this world, say, the government, kings and dictators, prime minister, presidents and even leaders of companies, know nothing about the foundation of the earth.
Methods to decrease poverty and distribute wealth more equally, such as a tax deductible mortgage interest, eventually led to the rich becoming richer.
A low salary of prime ministers leads to bad performance,... And take the examples of Mao Ze Dong who tried to stir up a new or follow the American technological revolution by imitating them, but then only made things worse. #todo/nogaftemaken 
Everything we do only messes up this world. We think we are giving freedom to humanity, but this freedom is only restricting them.

*Psalm 82:6-7 NIV*

*“I said, ‘You are “gods”; you are all sons of the Most High.’ But you will die like mere mortals; you will fall like every other ruler.”*

I must not think that because I am God's son I can do everything I want, that I will be forgiven for everything. I will die like a mortal, I will fall like every other human.
God can do everything to me and through me (ref. Php 2:13).

*Psalm 82:8 NIV*

*Rise up, O God, judge the earth, for all the nations are your inheritance.*

May You, O Lord, judge the Earth and everything that is in it. Only Your judgement deserves praise and only Your judgement is righteous.
