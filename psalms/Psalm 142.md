# Psalm 142
*A maskil[b] of David. When he was in the cave. A prayer.*
*1 I cry aloud to the Lord;*
*I lift up my voice to the Lord for mercy.*
*2 I pour out before him my complaint;*
*before him I tell my trouble.*

I do not understand the logic of verse 2, but I do understand to pour out all of my complaints to Him. He already knows what is going on in my mind and heart, so why should I crop it up? I can just tell Him, with respect, of course, but I can do it boldly, because Jesus will bring to Him my message.

*When my spirit grows faint within me, it is you who watch over my way.*

Sometimes my spirit grows faint, of all the pressure in my worldly life, even if it happens in church. At the moment what presses me is the criticism from my director at work and from the elder and a group at church asking me to become a deacon elder. In my work it is about being too sloppy, in church it is about my communication and collaboration.
This morning too, Lord, I did not feel very well, not just because of the couch which I slept on or through strange times or perhaps the amount of sleep, but because of this criticism and pressure from my wife for not going to bed on time and therefore not being able to make a baby.
All of this pressure is influencing my mind as well and causing anger and wrath within me. Therefore I need Your Spirit to stay strong within me, to not let my spirit grow faint. Let me not succumb to the any bad feeling or emotion.
I know emotions is what I need, but I think these emotions are not part of those.

*In the path where I walk people have hidden a snare for me.*

With *people* I immediately think of that group in church. With best intentions they did not put up a snare for me to trick me, but it feels like some of them are only there to criticize me. 

*Look and see, there is no one at my right hand; no one is concerned for me. I have no refuge; no one cares for my life.*
*Psalm 142:3-4 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.142.3-4.NIV*

I know this is not true, but I also know that people can *feel* that way. I am thankful for being in such a loving and caring environment. 

*I cry to you, Lord ; I say, “You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.”*
*Psalm 142:5 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.142.5.NIV*

Though it feels like I have no one on my side, even my wife is (still) angry with me, even if it were really true that no one is on my side, I know and will always know that I have You, and having You is more than enough.
In this world You are my portion, that is, Your gift to me. How can there be anything worth more than what the Lord of Lords has given me?
No matter how small a thing You have given me, it is worth more than the most expensive thing here on Earth.

*Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need; rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me. Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name. Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me.*
*Psalm 142:6-7 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.142.6-7.NIV*

It is not a coincidence that David writes *"my* prison". It feels like the prison I am in, is one that I have created myself, or that it is meant for me only. I may be in a prison of guilt, shame or self-pity or all of them. No, it is a prison of arrogance and self-righteousness, a righteousness I have created for myself, a world in which I am righteous and not wrong. 
Forgive me, Father, but thank You for showing me.

There are three parts to these verses. The first one is that "they" are too strong for me. This world I have created, which is a prison in fact, is so strong that I cannot break out of it. I need You help, Lord.
The second part is that I need to break free to praise You. I can praise Your Name anytime and anywhere, but I cannot give You glory if people think of me as arrogant. Help me to change that, Lord.
The third part is about people gathering around me, not for my benefit, but for Yours. If I can lead Your people in the way You want me to lead them, that will give glory to Your Name.
