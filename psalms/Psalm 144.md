# Psalm 144
*Praise be to the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.*

Everything that happened in my life, happened for a reason, to train me for war. Even the tiniest parts of my body, my fingers, are prepared for it.
Even the earliest and shortest or most insignificant memories I have of being a child have formed me into the man I am today.

This verse makes me realize I am either going to war or I already am at war. Which war? The war against the Satan and his army of demons and everyone and everything on Earth he has possessed.

*He is my loving God and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples under me.*
*Psalm 144:1-2 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.144.1-2.NIV*

Dear God, You love me and You protect me. You stand still like a stronghold, never moving and taking in everything that comes Your way, insults and theories about You not existing or not having performed miracles, all kinds of attacks from the devil. You take it all, to protect me.
And You are my deliverer as well, every time I am in deep trouble. You dive into that trouble, take the punishment on Yourself and save me. Not once or twice, but countless times, and even still doing so, until I die.
You are also my shield, nothing comes past You, nothing penetrates, I am safe as long as I am behind You and following You.

*Lord , what are human beings that you care for them, mere mortals that you think of them? They are like a breath; their days are like a fleeting shadow.*
*Psalm 144:3-4 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.144.3-4.NIV*

To the world I am worth nothing, but to You, Lord, I am more precious than diamonds. You treat me like Your own child, even though I am not, and You give me more than I deserve.
What have I done to deserve all this love from You? Nothing. That is why it is called unconditional love.
I am here on Earth for such a short time, eighty years or less. Out of the, say, eight thousand years of history I have experienced only one percent. My influence on that time line is even smaller.

*Part your heavens, Lord , and come down; touch the mountains, so that they smoke. Send forth lightning and scatter the enemy; shoot your arrows and rout them.*

There is no such thing as too great for You, Lord. I do not need to be humble in asking You for a small request, because even asking You to split the heavens and erupt volcanoes, would be but a small gesture for You.
Deliver me, oh Lord, from the hands of the Satan who is trying to grab me all day long.
Perform Your wonders so that the world, at least this generation, may see that You are God, that they will fear You and that some may even be saved, such as Rahab.

*Reach down your hand from on high; deliver me and rescue me from the mighty waters, from the hands of foreigners whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.*
*Psalm 144:5-8 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.144.5-8.NIV*

You have put me in a land of foreigners, both literally as figuratively. I am in a land with people who are not from China, and who are not Christian. Either way, this world is polluted and full of sin and so am I.
Rescue me, Lord, for I do not belong here. Let me not become a part of them.

*I will sing a new song to you, my God; on the ten-stringed lyre I will make music to you, to the One who gives victory to kings, who delivers his servant David. From the deadly sword*
*Psalm 144:9-10 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.144.9-10.NIV*

Not just praising You with songs, but even writing new songs for You, because Your wonders are endless, and all of the songs in the world do not suffice in giving You the praise You deserve.
You have saved my life and that of others, You have even saved kings and gave them victories. You deserve praise from everyone, not just the poor and needy, but actually, especially from the rich and mighty, for it is You Who gave them that.

*deliver me; rescue me from the hands of foreigners whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.*
*Psalm 144:11 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.144.11.NIV*

Once again this verse about foreigners shows up. The first time it went together with mighty waters from which we need to be saved. The second time it comes with a sword from which we need to be delivered.
And right between these verses David is writing a new song. Right in the middle of our persecutions we should write our songs, because then we should be thankful for our growth, our strength, our honor for being chosen to suffer for Him and really make the choice. And of course for our great reward (ref. Mt 5:12).

*Then our sons in their youth will be like well-nurtured plants, and our daughters will be like pillars carved to adorn a palace.*

Lord God Almighty, if You take care of our children, our sons will grow, not only physically but also spiritually and in wisdom. Our daughters will be of support to Your Kingdom and be beautiful as well, for Your glory.

*Our barns will be filled with every kind of provision. Our sheep will increase by thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields; our oxen will draw heavy loads.*

Our provisions will never be empty, we will never have to worry about that, because You take care of us. We will have more than we can imagine. A thousand fold of what we have already.
What seems impossible is but a simple gesture for You, oh almighty God.

*There will be no breaching of walls, no going into captivity, no cry of distress in our streets. Blessed is the people of whom this is true; blessed is the people whose God is the Lord .*
*Psalm 144:12-15 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.144.12-15.NIV*

At this moment there is captivity, of Christians even, there are many cries, every day I think, in Syria. The walls of privacy and freedom have been breached in Middle Eastern countries.
But in the future we know this will not happen anymore, because everyone will know that You are God.
