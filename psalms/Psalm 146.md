# Psalm 146
Psalm 146

*1 Praise the Lord.[a]*
*Praise the Lord, my soul.*
*2 I will praise the Lord all my life;*
*I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.*

I mean it when I say that I will praise the Lord all my life. Let this be a warning and a declaration of war against the Satan. There is nothing the Satan can do to me to not praise the Lord. Even in death I will praise the Lord, for as long as the Lord lives, and as long as He is with me, I am grateful for everything He has given me.

*3 Do not put your trust in princes,*
*in human beings, who cannot save.*
*4 When their spirit departs, they return to the ground;*
*on that very day their plans come to nothing.*
*5 Blessed are those whose help is the God of Jacob,*
*whose hope is in the Lord their God.*

I do not trust nor put my trust in anyone in a position of power, for I know that God put them there and they too are dependent on God's mercy. So my trust must be put in God as well.
But those who trust in the Lord, those I will trust as well.

*6 He is the Maker of heaven and earth,*
*the sea, and everything in themâ€”*
*he remains faithful forever.*
*7 He upholds the cause of the oppressed*
*and gives food to the hungry.*
*The Lord sets prisoners free,*

As the Lord does, so must I care about the the cause of the oppressed and even more so, uphold it and give to them.
Help me, Lord, in knowing how

*8 the Lord gives sight to the blind,*
*the Lord lifts up those who are bowed down,*
*the Lord loves the righteous.*
*9 The Lord watches over the foreigner*
*and sustains the fatherless and the widow,*
*but he frustrates the ways of the wicked.*

The Lord does many good things to many people, one condition only can be read from this verse, and that is not to be wicked. The Lord can do everything, He can heal me, He can lift me up, He can love me, even if I am a foreigner, whether I have parents or am married or not.

*The Lord reigns forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Praise the Lord .*
*Psalm 146:10 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.146.10.NIV*

I praise You because You live forever. I know that everything that I cannot finish in this life, You will finish either after my life here on Earth or in heaven.
I praise You because everything depends on You, and none of it depends on us.
