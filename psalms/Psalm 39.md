# Psalm 39
*Psalm 39:1-3 NIV*

*I said, “I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin;*
*I will put a muzzle on my mouth while in the presence of the wicked.”*
*So I remained utterly silent, not even saying anything good.*
*But my anguish increased; my heart grew hot within me.*

Why did David not say anything in the presence of the wicked? Did he give up hope that the Lord would change others? Was he too tired to say anything?
No, he said it because he did not want to sin with his mouth. In that case it is better to not speak at all, unless you cannot restrain yourself anymore.

*While I meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:*

*Psalm 39:4-5 NIV*

*“Show me, Lord ,*
*my life’s end and the number of my days;*
*let me know how fleeting my life is.*
*You have made my days a mere handbreadth;*
*the span of my years is as nothing before you.*
*Everyone is but a breath,*
*even those who seem secure.*

You have said this so I can understand what is important. First of all, everything is but a breath, compared with eternity nothing is "really important".
As David asked I am asking You now, let me know how fleeting my life is. Let me show the unimportance of my salary and position, and show me how much more important it is to serve you.
You have shown me: working closer at home allows me to have more time with my family, more meetings for church and fellowships, to be more at rest and therefore use more of my energy on You and my family.

But if I do get the other job, there are of course benefits. I get to spend more silent time with you, studying Your Word or even studying for a degree.
I am doubting, Lord, that if I get this job, how will I know it is what You prefer? Do I need a calling before I can study theology?

Please give me peace in my heart and mind.

*Psalm 39:6 NIV*

*“Surely everyone goes around like a mere phantom;*
*in vain they rush about,*
*heaping up wealth without knowing whose it will finally be.*

I have given up the thought of heaping wealth, that is of utter uselessness.

*Psalm 39:7-11 NIV*

*“But now, Lord, what do I look for?*
*My hope is in you.*
*Save me from all my transgressions;*
*do not make me the scorn of fools.*

David spoke, at last, because his heart was burning, and I assume it was inspired by the Holy Spirit.
He had to say out loud, to acknowledge that the span of life time is utterly small, compared to eternity.
Where can he put his hope on now? The answer is in the Lord.

*I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for you are the one who has done this.*
*Remove your scourge from me;*
*I am overcome by the blow of your hand.*

Now he is talking about a punishment, but David does not complain, because he knows it is the Lord Who has done this.

*When you rebuke and discipline anyone for their sin,*
*you consume their wealth like a moth— surely everyone is but a breath.*
 
It is as if he is saying that the Lord took away his wealth, as a rebuke and discipline. No exceptions are made, everyone is like a breath.

Psalm 39:12-13 NIV

“Hear my prayer, Lord , listen to my cry for help; do not be deaf to my weeping. I dwell with you as a foreigner, a stranger, as all my ancestors were. Look away from me, that I may enjoy life again before I depart and am no more.”

This whole Psalm is an outcry for the Lord, I realize. And not saying anything, can be a sin as well.
Do not be attached to the length of your life, nor to wealth. Be instead a foreigner and dwell with God.
