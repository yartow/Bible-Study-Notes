# Psalm 27
*Psalm 27:1-3 NIV*

*The Lord is my light and my salvation— whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life— of whom shall I be afraid?*

*When the wicked advance against me to devour me, it is my enemies and my foes who will stumble and fall.*
*Though an army besiege me, my heart will not fear; though war break out against me, even then I will be confident.*

The Lord's stronghold can withstand everything on Earth, for everything is created by Him. Whom shall I fear? No one, but only if the Lord is the stronghold of my life. I need to be connected to Him in order to stay strong.
Not only will I stay strong, but also my enemies will fall.

*Psalm 27:4-5 NIV*

*One thing I ask from the Lord , this only do I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of the Lord and to seek him in his temple. For in the day of trouble he will keep me safe in his dwelling; he will hide me in the shelter of his sacred tent and set me high upon a rock.*

No matter how far away I may be from You, Lord, please let me always see Your face, because then I will know that I need to return to you. Please keep me safe, protect me especially when I am weak.

*Psalm 27:6 NIV*

*Then my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me; at his sacred tent I will sacrifice with shouts of joy; I will sing and make music to the Lord .*

No matter in which situation I am, as long as I'm with you, Lord, I can rejoice and praise You.

*Psalm 27:7-9 NIV*

*Hear my voice when I call, Lord ; be merciful to me and answer me.*
*My heart says of you, “Seek his face!” Your face, Lord , I will seek. Do not hide your face from me, do not turn your servant away in anger; you have been my helper. Do not reject me or forsake me, God my Savior.*

This part is connected to verse 6, why it has his "head" exalted is probably because with the rest of his body he does other things for God. He uses his voice of call, his heart to say. In other words, his whole being is dedicated to the Lord, to contact with the Lord, to receiving and "giving" in as far as one can give. Also, to cry out and beg, that is part of his prayer as well.
Many times I forget about this last part. I try to give my whole life to God, my time, my money, both of which were already His by the way, but in changing my character I am fairly reluctant.
Help me, Lord, to surrender not just my life, but my whole being to You, every part on the outside and on the inside, and every part that can give or receive. Help me to cry out to You, without shame, to beg You, without fear. Instead exposing my whole self and letting You see every part of me.

*Psalm 27:10-14 NIV*

*Though my father and mother forsake me, the Lord will receive me. Teach me your way, Lord ; lead me in a straight path because of my oppressors. Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, spouting malicious accusations.*

The desire of my foes, does that mean that David desired what his foes desired as well, or that the desire of his foes was to kill him? The latter, I think.
In my case my foe is the devil and he wants me to not succeed, as a teacher, an example for children and the rest of the world. It is so hard, Lord, to keep on doing good things without ever defaulting. I need Your strength, I have not a shield strong enough enough to withstand the arrows of the Satan.
Helpen, Lord.

I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait for the Lord ; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord .
