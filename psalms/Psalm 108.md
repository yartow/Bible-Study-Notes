# Psalm 108
*Psalm 108:1-5 NIV*

*My heart, O God, is steadfast; I will sing and make music with all my soul.*

Yes, Lord, I want to praise You with a steadfast heart, not a heart that is doubtful and praise You only in those moments of happiness. You have given me a heart with which I can praise You, by giving it to You, by letting You be the Master of it.
I thank You that my heart is steadfast, that it is not easily influenced by this world. It is all because of Your grace and Your strength. I need Your help with my perseverance in Your laws. I cannot control my mind without Your strength.

*Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn. I will praise you, Lord , among the nations; I will sing of you among the peoples. For great is your love, higher than the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.*

I must train my musical skills again to praise You. Bless me, Lord, with peace and patience, and inspiration and a good studio so I can give You praise there and compose wonderful music for You.
I want to sing of Your greatness, not of my personal troubles, but only of when You were great in my life.

*Psalm 108:6-9 NIV*

*Save us and help us with your right hand, that those you love may be delivered. God has spoken from his sanctuary: “In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Sukkoth. Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah is my scepter. Moab is my washbasin, on Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”*

When the Israelites asked for Your help, You spoke to them from Your sanctuary, telling them which peoples or places would be protected.

*Psalm 108:10-13 NIV*

*Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? Is it not you, God, you who have rejected us and no longer go out with our armies? Give us aid against the enemy, for human help is worthless. With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies.*

The only way, I realize, to attack my enemy is to go there with You. There is no way I can attack the Satan myself, I cannot face my fears myself. The Satan will see that and attack me on these points. But only with you beside me and in front of me, I can face Him. Or rather it is You Who faces him, because my help is worthless.
