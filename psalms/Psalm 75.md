# Psalm 75
*Psalm 75:1-5 NIV*

*We praise you, God, we praise you, for your Name is near; people tell of your wonderful deeds.*

Father, You are near me and everyone praying in Your Name. That alone is reason enough to praise You, for we do not deserve it, and we do not deserve to see Your wonderful deeds.

*You say, “I choose the appointed time; it is I who judge with equity. When the earth and all its people quake, it is I who hold its pillars firm.*

*Indeed* *it is You Who judge, and You alone can judge with equity. You have held us firm throughout all storms. Without You this world would be a mess, it is only because of Your power that the devil has not released his full power.*

*To the arrogant I say, ‘Boast no more,’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horns.*

To all who think they know everything, who think they are a lot, who think they will not be affected by poverty, third world circumstances, or even by God, God says *Boast no more*. Unfortunately they do not listen. 
Help these people to open their hearts, Lord, like Stephen Hawking and Richard Dawkins. And let them not influence any more people with their bad motives.

*Do not lift your horns against heaven; do not speak so defiantly.’ ”*

These people do not realize they are lifting up their horns against You, the Almighty, will You forgive them? Is it true they do not realize, even after so many counterarguments from Christian and Intelligent Design opponents, and even specifically targeting Christians with their comments?
I cannot judge, for I cannot see within their hearts, but you can, O God, for You are the Lord Almighty, God of Israel, Who has saved and redeemed Israel up until even now in her war with the Palestinians.

*Psalm 75:6-8 NIV*

*No one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt themselves. It is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another.*

No one can forgive oneself for the sins one committed to another, no can provide leniency. Only God can, only can God can forgive.
By claiming all that the above two people claimed, they are saying that God is a liar, for they say there is no judge, "we are all judges of ourselves. There is no one to bring us down, only we can bring ourselves down."

*In the hand of the Lord is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs.*

I am not sure what kind of wine this is, but if foaming is something good, it means that the wicked will kneel down to drink just to get some blessings from God.
If it is something bad, I interpret it that the wicked long for something bad and they will get it, more than they can handle. Or it means that the wicked are so thirsty they are even willing to drink this kind of wine.

*Psalm 75:9-10 NIV*

*As for me, I will declare this forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob, who says, “I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.”*

But no matter whether the wicked get rewarded or not, and whether the righteous are oppressed, I will still praise the Lord, for He is good and has always been.

God will cut off the horns of the wicked, they will have no more cups to fill with blessings, they will have no more protection to hold on to.
