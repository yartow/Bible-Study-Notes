# Psalm 47
*Psalm 47:1-4 NIV*

*Clap your hands, all you nations; shout to God with cries of joy.*

*For the Lord Most High is awesome, the great King over all the earth.*
*He subdued nations under us, peoples under our feet.*
*He chose our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob, whom he loved.*

In verse 1 it does not say why we must praise him. It is written in verses 2 and further, although not in details. Which nations has He subdued for You?
Perhaps verse 4 means something to you. *He chose our inheritance.* That is one fact which gives more than enough reason to praise Him. What you have right now and what you will have in your life here on earth and after this, is all due to God's will, His plan. You do not have an inheritance based on your own efforts.

*Psalm 47:5-7 NIV*

*God has ascended amid shouts of joy, the Lord amid the sounding of trumpets.*

Is it not wonderful to hear that God has ascended; if we want this as well, should we not sound our trumpets?

*Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises.*
*For God is the King of all the earth; sing to him a psalm of praise.*

And even more than that, should we not sing praises to Him? If someone is asking why He does not see or hear God, tell him this, God ascended amid a lot of praise and sound, do you have this kind of a welcome for Him?

*Psalm 47:8-9 NIV*

*God reigns over the nations;*
*God is seated on his holy throne.*
*The nobles of the nations assemble as the people of the God of Abraham,*
*for the kings of the earth belong to God;*
*he is greatly exalted.*

I know that in the Dutch government there are a few Christians, and there probably are a few in the US Senate as well, but not all nobles are Christian, right?
So what would this verse mean?
