# Psalm 24
*Psalm 24:1-4 NIV*

*The earth is the Lord ’s, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it; for he founded it on the seas and established it on the waters.*

Everything belongs to the Lord, both my money as well as my debts.

*Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord ? Who may stand in his holy place? The one who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not trust in an idol or swear by a false god.*

The answer to this question is expected to be no one, but David shows that it is possible to come close to God, although it is through forgiveness. In my own words, those who have the best intentions not to hurt others, whose hopes are on the Lord and not on someone or something else.

**Psalm 24:5-6 NIV**

**They will receive blessing from the Lord and vindication from God their Savior. Such is the generation of those who seek him, who seek your face, God of Jacob.**

Apart from the many blessings a person will receive from God when he trusts in Him, he will also grow in faith and trust in the Lord, be a blessing to others and be a witness of God's faithfulness.

**Psalm 24:7-10 NIV**

**Lift up your heads, you gates; be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.**
**Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.**

**Lift up your heads, you gates; lift them up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.**
**Who is he, this King of glory? The Lord Almighty— he is the King of glory.**

God is worthy enough to be hailed twice, No repetition of praise is too much, no analogy of God Almighty is overrepresented. God does not fit in a door or gate. The Lord does not battle, He has won even before the battle begins.
God not only has glory, He is the King of glory! No glory is worthy enough.

People, open up your hearts. No heart can contain all of God, but letting Him and receiving His touch will be enough to change all of your life.
