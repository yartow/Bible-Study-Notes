# Psalm 55
*P* *salm 55:1-8 NIV*

*Listen to my prayer, O God, do not ignore my plea; hear me and answer me. My thoughts trouble me and I am distraught because of what my enemy is saying, because of the threats of the wicked; for they bring down suffering on me and assail me in their anger.*

In my case my enemy is the devil, for he is trying to stir things in my mind, making me hate people and making me angry with them.

*My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death have fallen on me. Fear and trembling have beset me; horror has overwhelmed me.*

Sometimes it happens that we become so afraid, as David calls it *terrors of death*. Perhaps he literally means death, although I do not think he was afraid of dying. But these terrors are major, they can set people to do things they would never do, that is exactly what David is afraid of, that he will do things he may not do. 

*I said, “Oh, that I had the wings of a dove! I would fly away and be at rest. I would flee far away and stay in the desert; I would hurry to my place of shelter, far from the tempest and storm.”*

The thing David would like to do most is flee, that is always the easiest thing to do on the short term, and that is all people think about when they are afraid.

*Psalm 55:9-11 NIV*

*Lord, confuse the wicked, confound their words, for I see violence and strife in the city.*
*Day and night they prowl about on its walls; malice and abuse are within it. Destructive forces are at work in the city; threats and lies never leave its streets.*

The thing one could hope for most, after peace, is that the enemy has strife on its own side. If this happens, it is a blessing from God, for we did not have to do anything to win the war.
I do not understand, however, why David asks for confusion *for* he sees violence... In the city. If he sees violence, then confusion is not necessary anymore, is it? 

Perhaps it is in his own city where he sees violence and strife, then it becomes logical. He wants the innocent to be saved, so he asks for confusion in the enemies.

*Psalm 55:12-14 NIV*

*If an enemy were insulting me, I could endure it; if a foe were rising against me, I could hide. But it is you, a man like myself, my companion, my close friend, with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship at the house of God, as we walked about among the worshipers.*

David's own close friend betrayed him, insulted him and God. How can David attack his own friend? He had problems dealing with his own family as well, I suppose the same is going on with his friend.
Perhaps he is writing about Joab, or about Abiathar the priest. The latter is most unbelievable, one who has been ordained in the order of priests, set apart for God, and yet betraying David for his son Absolve and...

*Psalm 55:15-19 NIV*

*Let death take my enemies by surprise; let them go down alive to the realm of the dead, for evil finds lodging among them.*

That us something bad to wish for your enemies. I can understand though, and God does not say that what David writes here us the way we should pray to God about our enemies. No, I believe God even has written somewhere that we should pray for our enemies.
However, in the case where the enemies cause so much death among your people, I think it is good to pray that your enemies will stop murdering, whether through conversion or through death taking their lives.

*As for me, I call to God, and the Lord saves me. Evening, morning and noon I cry out in distress, and he hears my voice. He rescues me unharmed from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.*
*God, who is enthroned from of old, who does not change— he will hear them and humble them, because they have no fear of God.*

Do not think God does not listen to the ones who do not fear Him. Yes, He hears everyone's voice within their minds, and when they think badly of God, or too high if themselves, God will punish them for that as well.

*Psalm 55:20-21 NIV*

*My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant.*
*His talk is smooth as butter, yet war is in his heart;*
*his words are more soothing than oil, yet they are drawn swords.*

Why would a companion do that, betray his own friends? Loyalty is one reason why one sticks with a friend, but there must always be something higher in case your friend goes into the wrong direction.
David's friend and general, Joab, was loyal to him until he thought David's judgement was not right anymore. He based his judgment of David's judgment on something else than God's judgement.
He looked through the eyes of a warrior, someone seeking blood only and forgetting about love. Thus he did not have God in his mind, because God is love.

*Psalm 55:22-23 NIV*

*Cast your cares on the Lord*
*and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous be shaken.*
*But you, God, will bring down the wicked into the pit of decay;*
*the bloodthirsty and deceitful will not live out half their days.*

*But as for me, I trust in you.*

Do not worry, for you will survive, if you are righteous. Is anything that happens so bad you cannot survive? No, it is never is.

But the wicked will not survive, they will be brought into the pit of decay. What does that mean?
I have known people who did not finish their middle school, they live a life of poverty, eat unhealthy, have unhealthy relationships and unhealthy jobs.
Will they ever get out of it? Just as hard as it is to get out of a pit.
