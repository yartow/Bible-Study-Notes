# Psalm 66
*Psalm 66:1-4 NIV*

*Shout for joy to God, all the earth! Sing the glory of his name; make his praise glorious. Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies cringe before you. All the earth bows down to you; they sing praise to you, they sing the praises of your name.”*

This is an outcry to all the earth, every person, every animal and every thing that has a voice, must praise God. And everything does, except for many humans.
How awesome is our God. Is there a single thing here on Earth, a single cell of an animal or plant, a single feature of a human being, that does not surprise us, which we can easily rebuild, manufacture or even improve?
No there is not. Even the easiest and littlest thing cannot be recreated and keeps fascinating the brightest minds of this world. Whole books have been written on what we know about the human body, and the conclusion is that we do not even know how much we do not know.

Still, people claim to know even where we are from and where we are going to. How humans will evolve, and how they do not need God.

**Psalm 66:5-7 NIV**

**Come and see what God has done, his awesome deeds for mankind! He turned the sea into dry land, they passed through the waters on foot— come, let us rejoice in him. He rules forever by his power, his eyes watch the nations— let not the rebellious rise up against him.**

One simple thing for God, splitting a sea and letting His people walk through it, yet no one understands how He has performed this miracle.
It shows us that God rules. Now that is what I call awesomeness.

**Psalm 66:8-12 NIV**

**Praise our God, all peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard; he has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping.**

No matter what you think of God, He has preserved our lives. Perhaps you are thinking what God has done for you and that all his time you have survived by yourself, but then you are only fooling yourself.
Who gave you what you have right now? Who gave you he opportunity to go to school, your talent which made you what you are right now? Who gave you your friends, or the lack of bad friends? Everything you see or do not see was planned in such a way by God to let you grow and honor Him for it, not to brag about how good you think you are.
Rather or better yet, think of it in this way: you can be so much better a person when you have Him by your side!

**For you, God, tested us; you refined us like silver. You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs. You let people ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance** *.*

Everything is indeed as David says, you *refined* us. You made sure we would become the persons you want us to be. 
If David is mentioning the period of the Israelites in Egypt, he is talking about the Israelites being in prison, and being flogged.
The fire and water could be meant figuratively, but could also be interpreted as the process needed in order to be saved. Moses had to walk through the sea, and past the burning columns, which were holding off the Egyptians.
Fire in our lives could seem like a blockage, but we must realize it is only a blockage for those God does not want to enter; for those He does want to enter it is protection from all enemies who want to pull you into hell.
Imagine a river full of crocodiles which you need to cross. And that moment you might think that it is better to be beaten by my enemy than to be eaten by a crocodile. But if somehow you have passed the river, you will see that the crocodiles are protecting you from that enemy.
If you are facing something difficult in life, do not let that stop you. For when you stop your enemy will catch up, beat you and drag you back to where you were. But if you get past this hardship, this hardship will be the stronghold God gave you to withstand the devil.
The next time something difficult faces you, you will have had the experience of conquering it.

Going through the water is a next step in your walk with God. It is faith, how much do you trust God? Do you trust God to open doors for you which seem impossible to be opened? Do you trust Him enough to know that He wants to do it this way, so that You will know His power and experience His wonders? (instead of just opening the door.)

As for my personal situation: Will I choose this house, which needs a big renovation and a lot of money, or an already finished house, without necessary renovations and additional money to loan?
It seemed to easy to find a house like that. The size we wanted, the height, the division of rooms, walls. It would not be a matter of faith or belief in God if this were to succeed. I would not give enough glory and honor to him.
Now though, I need to pray and listen to God, go on my knees, be silent and obey His will. Does He want me to give up on this house, or minimize my wishes and act out on His wishes? Do I trust Him enough to believe that *He will provide*, even if He asks me to give away my money, without promising me I will get another house in return for it? 

*Psalm 66:13-15 NIV*

*I will come to your temple with burnt offerings and fulfill my vows to you— vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble. I will sacrifice fat animals to you and an offering of rams; I will offer bulls and goats.*

Many times I have been in trouble and each of these times it was You, Lord, Who saved me. Unfortunately, not all of these times have I said *thank You, Lord* and even less times have I vowed to You to change my behavior or to do something in return, and still less than that have I kept my vow. 
Thank You, Lord, for keep forgiving me even though You know that I am at many times ungrateful, forgetful and unreliable in keeping my vows. And thank You for keep saving me while I do not deserve to. Not only do You save me, but You even give me more than I have dreamt of. More blessings than I can handle or give away.
Teach me, oh Lord, to bless others with the blessings You have given me.

*Psalm 66:16-17 NIV*

*Come and hear, all you who fear God; let me tell you what he has done for me. I cried out to him with my mouth; his praise was on my tongue.*

It is important to realize that David was praising God while crying out to Him. Yes, it is possible to cry and praise at the same time.
Especially in our worst cases we need to cry out to God and praise Him for putting us in that situation. Is there any situation that God allowed for no reason? Would God have done it the hard way while He could have done things easier?
No, is the answer, and that is why we should praise Him, because He could have given us an even harder way, but He did not, He gave us the softest way possible to realize His power, His might and love for us, and sometimes the softest way is still hard.

**Psalm 66:18 NIV**

**If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened;**

David writes that if he has sin in his heart, God would not have listened. But He did. How is it possible for a man not to have sin in his heart? It is not.
David said he did not cherish sin, which means that he does not like the sin he does have in his heart. He does not want to keep those sins, but rather wants to get rid of them.

*Psalm 66:19-20 NIV*

*but God has surely listened and has heard my prayer. Praise be to God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld his love from me!*

If I do not cherish sin, God will listen to my prayer. But most importantly, He does not withhold His love from me.
