# Psalm 133
*How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity!*

Even David (or the psalmist) acknowledges the importance of unity. Perhaps he is talking about his own people, the unity between several parties or between the tribes, or perhaps he is meaning the people of Israel versus the people outside of Israel.

*It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron’s beard, down on the collar of his robe.*

He gives an explanation of oil running from the head to the beard to the clothes. Blessings and salvation continue to pass on when people work together in unity.

*It is as if the dew of Hermon were falling on Mount Zion. For there the Lord bestows his blessing, even life forevermore.*
*Psalm 133:1-3 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.133.1-3.NIV* 

Blessings can even overcome impossible gaps, like the dew of Mount Hermon falling on another mountain, Zion, which is impossible of course, but David longs for it and so should we.
