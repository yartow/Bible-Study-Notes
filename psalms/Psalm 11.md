# Psalm 11
*Psalm 11:1-3 NIV*

*In the Lord I take refuge. How then can you say to me: “Flee like a bird to your mountain. For look, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrows against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart. When the foundations are being destroyed, what can the righteous do?”*

When not if
I am not the foundation of the church, God is.
If the foundation of God is gone, His Word, then nothing can be done anymore. What would be the foundation of the Sunday school? That the teachers teach from the Bible.

*Psalm 11:4-7 NIV*

*The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lord is on his heavenly throne. He observes everyone on earth; his eyes examine them. The Lord examines the righteous, but the wicked, those who love violence, he hates with a passion. On the wicked he will rain fiery coals and burning sulfur; a scorching wind will be their lot.*

*For the Lord is righteous, he loves justice; the upright will see his face.*

Do not worry, is the message here, because the Lord is still the One and Only King. He knows everything and everyone, both their actions and thoughts.
I cannot keep anything hidden from the Lord, and I know I will be punished for the wickedness inside me.
