# Psalm 61
*Psalm 61:1-3 NIV*

*Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer. From the ends of the earth I call to you, I call as my heart grows faint; lead me to the rock that is higher than I. For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the foe.*

If one faints, he holds himself to something that is higher than he is, and when one drowns, he too must hold something that is higher than the water in which he is. A wall, a citadel, is higher than men, and especially to higher than the enemy's height and barricades, to slow down the enemy and protect oneself.

We need to learn not to go down to get help. What most people do is ask their friends and family for help in the first place, but they are on the same level as you. How can two people in the water support each other? Eventually one will get tired.
How can people protect you from temptations, if they themselves are tempted by the devil as well, who is mightier than them.

Help me, Father, to find support in You first of all, and then use the right methods and support from the right persons.

*Psalm 61:4-5 NIV*

*I long to dwell in your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of your wings.*

David realizes that taking refuge under God's wings is different than taking refuge anywhere else. God is loving and gives more than He takes, blesses more than He asks of you. His promises last longer than You will live. And His protection is stronger than any enemy.

*For you, God, have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.*

One reason David has received this heritage is because these people were alive. If they were not, or if they were not believers of God, which is almost synonymous, David could not have received the heritage of knowing God.

Taking refuge under someone's wings means that other person is greater than you, and admitting this. Most of us would not allow to this to be forever. If you are a child, you might be sheltering under the wings of your father, but you know that one day you may be a father yourself, or at least a grown man, and you do not need that shelter but rather give it to others.
That is partially our ego as well that wants to escape from that shelter.
David, however, longs to dwell in God's tent *forever*! 
Perhaps not coincidentally, but David also writes of having the heritage of others who feared God's Name. This means that those others were men, parents probably, and taking refuge in God as well.
It is a good thing to get a heritage from such people, and to learn their fear for You as well.

*Psalm 61:6-8 NIV*

*Increase the days of the king’s life, his years for many generations. May he be enthroned in God’s presence forever; appoint your love and faithfulness to protect him. Then I will ever sing in praise of your name and fulfill my vows day after day.*

It sounds strange to ask God to do something for the king, while David is the king himself. I suppose he means a king who does good in the eyes of God.
But after that he writes, *then* I will ever sing. Are we not supposed to praise God at all times, not at one moment and most certainly not only after God has done something for us? 
David, however, probably does not mean it this way. What God does is good, by definition, because God is good. So if I say, I will praise God if he does good, it means I will praise all the time.
