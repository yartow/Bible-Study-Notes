# Psalm 65
*Psalm 65:1-4 NIV*

*Praise awaits you, our God, in Zion; to you our vows will be fulfilled.*

Not only in Zion, but in the whole world right now. People everywhere are praising You, Lord.

*You who answer prayer, to you all people will come.*

It is a characteristic by which we know You, Lord. You answer prayers, You show Yourself to us. That is how we got to know You.

*When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our transgressions.*

You did not simply forgive us. You had to pay for it.

*Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple.*

Those who live in Your courts are blessed, because they experience Your love every day. They live with all the good things You give, and everything about You and everything You give is good.

*Psalm 65:5-8 NIV*

*You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds, God our Savior, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas,*

*who formed the mountains by your power, having armed yourself with strength, who stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations.*

At this moment there is much turmoil in Your Holy Land. Please protect Israel from the attacks of the devil. The Satan uses other people, Palestinians and their innocent family, and the media to attack Israel. But I can see You are protecting her Yourself. You have protected the people and the army. You have given them arms and intelligence.

Most importantly, You can stop the turmoil not just here, but also in Hungaria, Russia, and in North Korea.
Please show Your might, Lord!

*The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders; where morning dawns, where evening fades, you call forth songs of joy.*

David says so, and indeed the whole world is fascinated with everything you have created: the human being, every plant and animal, the weather and all of nature. But the whole world does not know it is You Who created it all.
Let all honor go to You Who deserve it. Glory to the Lord, my King.

*Psalm 65:9-13 NIV*

*You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly. The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain, for so you have ordained it. You drench its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its crops. You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance.*

We do not realize how much work You have done for us in the fields. As it is written, it was *ordained* or *prepared* by You, and I only now realize, after reading, that everything indeed is prepared by You. 
The amazing amount of work man would have to do with harvest from a wild field, with broken trees and roots everywhere. But no, the places You have prepared for us are all workable. There is water, there is fertile soil, the animals and insects keep everything in balance.
It is wonderful to know that You have created swallows to eat grasshoppers, to prevent them from growing too big a flock. It all fits, it is all part of Your plan.

*The grasslands of the wilderness overflow; the hills are clothed with gladness. The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing.*

The image of this is something that gives peace. It gives peace because You created us to belong in those kinds of areas. We are made for nature.
