# Psalms 70 (ESV) 
**O LORD, Do Not Delay**
*TO THE CHOIRMASTER. OF DAVID, FOR THE MEMORIAL OFFERING.*
*1 Make haste, O God, to deliver me!*
*O LORD, make haste to help me!*
*2 Let them be put to shame and confusion*
*who seek my life!*
*Let them be turned back and brought to dishonor*
*who delight in my hurt!*
*3 Let them turn back because of their shame*
*who say, “Aha, Aha!”*

*4 May all who seek you*
*rejoice and be glad in you!*
*May those who love your salvation*
*say evermore, “God is great!”*
*5 But I am poor and needy;*
*hasten to me, O God!*
*You are my help and my deliverer;*
*O LORD, do not delay!*

## Structure
There is a blessing here and a curse. David begins and ends with a cry-out for help and in between those verses he curses and blesses. After all of this, he mentions a praise to God, of Who He is. 
It is a beautiful almost symmetric structure [A B C A D] that David uses, indicating on the one hand that he needs God, and that many things might happen in the mean time with good and bad people—whom he wishes all the best and worst—but regardless of others, *he* needs God. In my own words: "I don't care about how *you* are living—or actually, I do care—but *I* need God." And then to close it off, he praises God for being his help and deliverer, and not only that, but also mentions that God is *his* help and deliverer, indicating the personal relationship he has with God.

## Devotional
It has been seven years since I last wrote about this psalm (May, 2014) and I do not remember how I felt when I read it, but I think I read it shallowly—too shallowly even. Even though I have become spiritually more mature, am in a less financial position, my child has grown up and is nearing the age of twelve, and my marriage is better than it has ever been (and it was and has been *very* bad) I need God now more than ever. So it is not because of my circumstances that I need God, but because of my dependence on Him. 
In these past years I have learned to trust Him a little more in every field of my life. It is not merely an exercise to pray for every single thing in life, no matter how small, nor is it the little prayers throughout the whole day—both being good spiritual habits though—but rather the *realization* of the dependence one has on God. It is not that I have become more dependent on Him—for I am *just as dependent* on Him as I was as a baby and ever was and will be!—but I have realized that I cannot do anything right. *Everything* I do for myself or others negatively impacts me or them. 
Even in the field of health, where there are many books on diets and supplements and physical exercise, I have come to realize that with all the organic food and supplements I ate, nothing helped against the eczema on my hands. All the experience I have at work, with all the academic knowledge and communication skills have never led to a job I was satisfied with. 
Two of the jobs I was most satisfied with were a Christian school and a company with many "Christian" colleagues (many of whom call themselves "Christians", that is). The latter one was where I could live myself out. I had a few jobs of understanding processes and implementing software, nice colleagues (or so I thought, a few of those truly were), but it turned out in the end that my work was not appreciated. In the former job as teacher at the Christian school *The Foundation*, I got to teach children and explain to them about academics and the Bible, and work with #todo/opzoeken/engels oprecht, mature fellow Christian believers. Unfortunately—or actually fortunately—they could feel that the Holy Spirit told them that I was not really suited to teach there, using their method and with young children. Even though I love young children, I love teaching and I love, or at least prefer the homeschooling method over the conventional school methods, there still was a reason for God to put me there for these three months that I had worked there and then take me away. Or perhaps he did not want me to be there in the first place and I forced my own way in. Or perhaps the board with whom I had the interview did not listen to God's voice very well. All are possibilities and I know nothing for sure, except for one thing, and that is that I cannot keep a job and will never be able to fulfill my passion and goal if I do not have God. 

## Study of the Bible
Why did David intend this Psalm for the **memorial offering**? These verses are almost an identical copy of Psalm 40:13-17. It could very well be that David wanted to reuse these verses, but with a different melody for a different occasion. The first part of Psalm 40, until verse 13, tells more of God's work in David's life and His goodness, while the last part tells more of his current needs. This latter part was especially needed during the memorial offerings, where (I assume) people from the past were commemorated, such as Moses, Joshua and other "great" people of the past. In these situations the people needed to be humbled and know that God is the One Who rescues people. 
At the moment of writing David probably had in mind the situation where his son tried to put him out of office, and he was mocked by some of his officials as well. This humbled him and turned him to the only One Who could save Him. During the memorial offering, those were said, would be reminded to turn to the One Who saved their predecessors and ultimately their land. 

Never forget to remember God's works and to call out to Him in the present. Remember what he did to the good and to the bad, and now choose either the good or the bad.
