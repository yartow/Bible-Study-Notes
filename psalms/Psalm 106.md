# Psalm 106
*Psalm 106:1-3 NIV*

*Praise the Lord .*

Praise the Lord, for He is worthy to be praised. He is God, He is ruler and He is victor. Every day He shows it again, that He is stronger and mightier than we think, that he holds His promises even though we thought He did not, and that everything happens for a reason.

He knows me better than myself. I have always longed for God's blessings and that I could force myself to have the spiritual gift of giving. But I count the amount exactly that I give to the Lord and know what the taxes are that I can deduct. I long for something back and that is the wrong attitude, I should give simply because it is God's command to give with joy in one's heart.
Yesterday He showed me a call person who really has the gift of giving me Kaixiang, giving certainly more than his tenths, giving with joy in his heart and receiving a lot of blessing from the Lord.

God showed me once more that it is He Who gives blessings to those He wishes to give and He chooses what kind of blessing.

*Give thanks to the Lord , for he is good; his love endures forever. Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the Lord or fully declare his praise? Blessed are those who act justly, who always do what is right.*

But He is good, everything He does is good and it is all out of love.
There is no way to praise God for everything He has done, it is simply too much.
Let Him bless especially those who always do what is right.

*Psalm 106:4-5 NIV*

*Remember me, Lord , when you show favor to your people, come to my aid when you save them, that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise.*

I want to be saved by You as well. I know I have already been saved for my eternal life time in Heaven, but I have daily downs, small dips, where I need joy and hope. I thank You for the many *chosen ones*, other Christians I think that is, who help me out, unconsciously many times, but I know it is Your Holy Spirit that guides me to places to meet these others, I know He guides others to say certain things, and guides me to read certain things. 
You guide me and have guided me my whole life and I know You will guide me the rest of my life.
Praise the Lord, Hallelu Ya!

*Psalm 106:6-12 NIV*

*We have sinned, even as our ancestors did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly. When our ancestors were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles; they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea.*

*We* have sinned. Yes, we, who always think we are better than the Jews because we have accepted Jesus, who look down on the Pharisees because we think we act more from the heart. We think we do not rebel against God, and perhaps we do not do so directly, so that others can see it, but we do it in our hearts.
We have much more information and knowledge from the Bible to learn from the mistakes others made, we have the Holy Spirit to guide us and speak to our conscience, we have many books written by Christians over thousands of years, let alone articles on the Internet and seminars and sermons online.
Of anyone is sinning, it is we. We do not have the Red Sea where future generations can recognize us by, but they will know us by what we failed to do. The enormous flow out of church in these few decades, the many churches that closed their doors. We did not keep our responsibility to pray for our children and pray for our church.
Even within the church future generations will remember us by the Laws we have broken, by letting homosexuals get married in our countries, and even in church, allowing more and more liberal churches to come to existence, misusing the church for promiscuity and incest.
Outside of the church it is even worse, where drugs and prostitution are legalized, and euthanasia as well.

TODO OPZOEKEN welk vers: 1 Cor 10 these... We're given to you as examples so that you would not set your hearts in evil things such as they did.

*Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, to make his mighty power known.*

You do things not only for our sake, but for Your Name's sake as well, because Your Name is Holy. It may not be blemished with any lie of rumor or unfulfilled promises.
The Israelites did not deserve to be saved, it is that You had compassion on them, not because they feared You, but because You are a loving and caring God.

*He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert. He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them. The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.*

God's warnings, which are promises as well, might be postponed, for example by letting the Israelites live a little longer, by not punishing this generation, but the next one to be disobedient. His promises for good things He brings out to the full.
The adversaries of the Israelites, the Egyptians, were all killed in the sea. I do not know whether this was the whole army, but if it was, then this must have been a great shock for Egypt and especially Pharaoh. Most definitely he would not have wanted this to be written in history.
If only there was a way out to prove this to be true, to show the world that Your Word has been right all along, to bring praise to Your Name. I long to live to see that moment, Lord.

*Then they believed his promises and sang his praise.*

It is a shame that only then the Israelites believed Your promises. You deserve to be praised at all times, even if we do not "see" any miracles. Your promise was to take care of us, if I might put it this way, not according to the world's standards, but to Yours.

*Psalm 106:13-15 NIV*

*But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his plan to unfold. In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wilderness they put God to the test. So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease among them.*

As quick as the human being tends to forget all well being given to them, so they have forgotten You as well. I too have forgotten You at many times in my life. Even now I cannot remember all of the good things You have done for me, but I have belief that You will save me out of every problem I encounter. For the problems might be stepping stones for me to grow to become more like You.
I have sinned and I will even sin in the future, but let me never put You to the test, Lord. Let me never curse You or blame You for whatever happens to me, so that I will not offend You and be punished like the Israelites.

*Psalm 106:16-23 NIV*

*In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the Lord . The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram. Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked.*

When we become envious of the consecrated ones of the Lord, we commit a very bad sin.

*At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal. They exchanged their glorious God for an image of a bull, which eats grass.*

It is ironic to see how people can change the mighty God for a simple bull that eats grass, is dumb, mastered by people, and to treat that as their god. It is as if they decide to make their own slave their master.

*They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt, miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea. So he said he would destroy them— had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them.*

I often think I am saved because I am good. I am not speaking of my salvation in Christ here, but of my daily salvations, the times I deserved punishment but did not receive, is not because I compensated with good things, but because someone has done intercession for me, my wife perhaps. Someone prayed for my protection, is why I have been able to avoid many car crashes. Angels are watching over me all the time, and the Holy Spirit is speaking to me all the time, letting me know I am wrong when I am wrong.
Unfortunately it is too late to realize I am wrong after I have said something. Better late than never, but better to not say something hurtful than to say it.
I have a bad control of my tongue. Help me, Lord, to become better at this. I have been too proud in thinking I could restrain myself, my evil thoughts. Forgive me, Lord.
I have forgotten how much my wife, the wife you have given me, is worth to me, both visible and invisible.

*Psalm 106:24-27 NIV*

*Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise. They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the Lord .*

I believe Your promise, Lord, and I know You will keep it. My wife and I will grow towards becoming more like You and so that grow to become more like each other.
What I am afraid, though, is that Sandra has forgotten Your promise, and has lost her faith in You. She is coping with hatred, which is from the devil, and the devil is not letting her go at this moment. I am afraid that vengeance or wrath, and hatred will eat her up on the inside. Please help her, Lord, and let me be Your and her servant.

Please do not banish her, give her strength to cope with this situation and to cope with me.

I am asking You this now, because I see that even the Israelites despised the pleasant land, the land if Israel, more fertile than any other country, was despised.
The beautiful land and country of Israel, and they were grumbling in their tents instead of enjoying it outside?
This means (I think) that their hearts and eyes were blinded by something from the inside, their lust for money and greed for more.

*So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the wilderness, make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.*

Please do not punish Sandra anymore for her wrongs. Her wrongs in the past, and her wrongs right now to keep a grudge towards me and thereby giving a bad example for Nathan, may they be forgiven and thrown away as You have promised. If only she will repent for those sins and fear You.
Lord, I ask of You that You be merciful to her. Please give me strength to forgive her as well, and the emotional capacity to understand her.

*Psalm 106:28-33 NIV*

*They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods; they aroused the Lord ’s anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them.*

It is not simply doing a one time sin what the Jews did, it says here that they *yoked* themselves to idols. That is why, I think, we see the idolatry rising as soon as there is no punishment for it. It has been ingrained in the Jewish people, it has been written throughout the books of Kings and Chronicles.

*But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked. This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.*

Please do not be angry with me, Lord. If I am the intercessor for my family, I am probably also guilty of bringing Your wrath on them, when I myself have done wrong to You.
Forgive me for my sins Lord, and punish not my family for my wrong deeds.
Punish me, but keep watch over Nathan and Sandra.

*By the waters of Meribah they angered the Lord , and trouble came to Moses because of them; for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses’ lips.*

It is because of the sin of the Israelites that Moses had to humble himself, and his anger accumulated. Of course, his own arrogance played a crucial role in this as well, but I think it is the Jews that set it off.
I need to be careful with my behavior and words, because I can let other people sin by it.

*Psalm 106:34-39 NIV*

*They did not destroy the peoples as the Lord had commanded them, but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs. They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them. They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to false gods. They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood. They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves.*

Though prostitution in the sexual sense is not seen anywhere in this paragraph, God still calls the act "prostitution" because they sold "themselves". What is "themselves"? They gave their own children, their own flesh and blood, to other gods; they adopted the customs of other nations, by *mingling* in with them, that is marrying them and thus giving their bodies to them.
All of this sin started by marrying people from another nation, something the Israelites were not allowed to do. They got possessed by it and sinned worse and worse, all the while forgetting their God more and more.

*Therefore the Lord was angry with his people*
*and abhorred his inheritance.*
*41 He gave them into the hands of the nations,*
*and their foes ruled over them.*
*42 Their enemies oppressed them*
*and subjected them to their power.*
*43 Many times he delivered them,*
*but they were bent on rebellion*
*and they wasted away in their sin.*

The Lord is not afraid to punish us as we deserve, He is not afraid of anything. He is a righteous God and even though it hurts Him to let His own children be hurt, He will still do so to show He is righteous God.

*44 Yet he took note of their distress*
*when he heard their cry;*
*45 for their sake he remembered his covenant*
*and out of his great love he relented.*
*46 He caused all who held them captive*
*to show them mercy.*

But God notes our distress, not because He cannot hold Himself, but because He is merciful. For *our* sake He remembers His covenant.
Thank You, Father, that You do this for our sake, because we do not deserve it and we do not have any right to it, not even with the covenant You made.

*Psalm 106:47 NIV*

*Save us, Lord our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.*

I need to be saved first before I can give you praise, before I can even thank You.
Gather us from every nation so that we may give You praise and honor and show the world You are worthy to be praised, and You alone.
So many people here in this world do not know they are praising idols, popstars, sports stars and actors, even worse they do not know they are not praising You, Who alone should be praised.

*Psalm 106:48 NIV*

*Praise be to the Lord , the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, “Amen!” Praise the Lord .*

Let everyone mean it when they praise You, Lord, for it so shameful to see when a so-called Christian goes the wrong way and the whole world sees this person and gets a wrong image of You.
