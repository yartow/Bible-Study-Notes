# Psalm 79
*Psalm 79:1-4 NIV*

*O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple, they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.*

It is the nations indeed who have done that, but God has allowed it. The nations are guilty of their sins, of defiling the temple and destroying the city which God gave the Israelites.

*They have left the dead bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your own people for the animals of the wild.*
**They have poured out blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead.**

They have killed Your people, God, I know You grieve about that. I know You even grieve about the other nations killing Yours.
They killed so many that the place is full of blood.

*We are objects of contempt to our neighbors, of scorn and derision to those around us.*

Help us, Lord, it is bad enough that so many of us are killed, but being left with scorn and derision is even worse.
Not only do they scorn us, but also You, our God, saying how weak our God is and that He cannot even protect us.

*Psalm 79:5-7 NIV*

*How long, Lord ? Will you be angry forever? How long will your jealousy burn like fire? Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name; for they have devoured Jacob and devastated his homeland.*

I know that You are angry with me, and with us as well. We are the ones who have sinned and we deserve this punishment and even more. But we ask You for forgiveness, to punish us no longer and let us repent for our sins.
Revenge us and pour out Your wrath over the nations that have caused this wreckage. Give glory to Your Name, let them honor it and hold it high.

Revenge Yourself for they have destroyed what You have built up.

*Psalm 79:8-10 NIV*

*Do not hold against us the sins of past generations;*

We are not saying we have not sinned ourselves, but our forefathers have sinned and the ones before them as well. They have caused You anger and tested Your patience. So have we, but please let us not account for their sins.
Instead help us to remind ourselves to take care of our children. Every sin we commit against You, will weigh heavy upon their shoulders, everything we do which puts Your patience to the test, will have a negative impact on Your patience for our children.

**may your mercy come quickly to meet us, for we are in desperate need.**

Please help us, because we need Your mercy. We can never pay You back for what You have given us. We can never repay You our debts. That is why the only thing we can ask for is mercy.
We ask You for mercy for our children as well. Let us be good parents and teachers to bring them to You, living in and obeying Your Word.

*Help us, God our Savior, for the glory of your name; deliver us and forgive our sins for your name’s sake.*

Eventually the most important thing is that God will be glorified.

*Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”*

Above all, please let Your name be glorified. Do not give the enemy a chance to look down on You, to even think You do not have the power to save us. Do not let anyone mock You.

*Before our eyes, make known among the nations that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants.*

Let us know You are our God and that You protect Your people. This will give us strength and confidence in You.
I know we asking a lot, because You have already shown so many times that You are God, but still we ask for more signs. Please forgive us for that, give us faith, with or without having ever seen miracles.

*Psalm 79:11-13 NIV*

*May the groans of the prisoners come before you; with your strong arm preserve those condemned to die.*

Please hear our cries. Perhaps we have not been crying out too hard or too often, and we were selfish in our cries. We know You can hear us and we know You can save us.

*Pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times the contempt they have hurled at you, Lord. Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will praise you forever; from generation to generation we will proclaim your praise.*

We praise You no matter You save us or not, for Your greatness and Your unfathomable plan, but let us praise You for paying back the enemies what they have hurled at You. Let them see what might You have so their generations, if there are any left, will fear You as well into eternity, or even better, see that You are mighty God, and want to worship You instead of their own fake gods.
