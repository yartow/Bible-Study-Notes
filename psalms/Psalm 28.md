# Psalm 28
*To you, Lord, I call; you are my Rock, do not turn a deaf ear to me. For if you remain silent, I will be like those who go down to the pit.*
*Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you for help, as I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place. (Psalm 28:1, 2 NIV)*

Dear Lord, I thank You for always listening to me. In all the days of the last months when I have not been obedient You still listened to my outcries, my prayers and gave me so many responses. You never shut Yourself off of me, even though You could.

Without Your voice I now know that I would be like those in the pit, isolated and alone, not knowing night from day. No activity yet still restless.

*Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those who do evil, who speak cordially with their neighbors but harbor malice in their hearts.*
*Repay them for their deeds and for their evil work; repay them for what their hands have done and bring back on them what they deserve. (Psalm 28:3, 4 NIV)*

Please let me be different from the wicked, even though I know I have done just as many things. I harbor no malice in my heart, however, and I do not pretend to be nice to people. This on the other hand, may have caused malice on other people's side, because I was not friendly enough.
I do not know what the right thing was to do, even if I look at it right now, are some jobs not quite for me, or is it that I need to change? Should I ask that You repay them for what they have done? That does not feel like forgiveness to me.

*Because they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord and what his hands have done, he will tear them down and never build them up again.*

Let this be a warning to my enemies but to me as well. If one has no regard for what the Lord has done, He will tear them down and never build them up again. Just as He did with pharaoh and Saul and other kings.
Get back to the Lord as soon as you can, before it's too late.

*Praise be to the Lord, for he has heard my cry for mercy.*
*The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and he helps me. My heart leaps for joy, and with my song I praise him. (Psalm 28:5-7 NIV)*

But when you cry out, He will hear You. The Lord is my strength, which means that when I am weak, He becomes my power. Everything I do then, will be by His power and for His cause.
He is also my shield, He protects me from everything I cannot stand against, all the forces of evil are too strong for me and I can only defeat them when He is with me.

*The Lord is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one. Save your people and bless your inheritance; be their shepherd and carry them forever. (Psalm 28:8, 9 NIV)*

The Lord is more than just a personal Savior, He even saves His whole people, and stands like a fortress in front of us taking all the blow a.
God blessed us, not the land or everything within it.
