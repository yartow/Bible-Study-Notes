# Psalm 85
*Psalm 85:1-3 NIV*

*You, Lord , showed favor to your land; you restored the fortunes of Jacob. You forgave the iniquity of your people and covered all their sins. You set aside all your wrath and turned from your fierce anger.*

Thank You, Father, for forgiving Your people, and restoring Your nation. If You had not done so, I would never have a chance to meet you, to be forgiven by You and be part of Your family.

*Psalm 85:4-7 NIV*

*Restore us again, God our Savior, and put away your displeasure toward us. Will you be angry with us forever? Will you prolong your anger through all generations? Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you? Show us your unfailing love, Lord , and grant us your salvation.*

We are so fortunate to be living in the future that Asaph hoped for.
We already have your salvation.

*Psalm 85:8-9 NIV*

*I will listen to what God the Lord says; he promises peace to his people, his faithful servantsâ€” but let them not turn to folly.*

I listen to the Lord because everything He warns us for is right, and every consequence of what I do when I follow His command is.
Yet He knows when to give us tension and action, because too much peace would make us lax and weak and we would not increase our perseverance if we did not have and trifles in life.

*Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that his glory may dwell in our land.*

Let me fear You, Lord, if that makes Your salvation near me, and that Your glory may dwell in our land. Our land, the Netherlands, needs You, Lord. The government is on the verge of forgetting You, there hardly is a single rule that keeps the Law of the Bible.

*Psalm 85:10-13 NIV*

*Love and faithfulness meet together; righteousness and peace kiss each other.*

Where God is, there love and faithfulness meet together. Perhaps this indicates the relationships between men and women.
Righteousness and peace kiss each other. In the current world, there is no righteousness and there is no peace. Rich people have too much power, and it creates unrest in the people's hearts.
Where there is righteousness, when someone is executed, where abortions are illegal and where euthanasia, same sex marriages, transgender operations are not permitted, even there the people are not at rest.

*Faithfulness springs forth from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven. The Lord will indeed give what is good, and our land will yield its harvest.*

No matter what people think, what God gives is good. Only when God gives us good things, the land will yield its harvest. It is only in good conditions that something can grow, and only in the right situations that we can grow.

*Righteousness goes before him and prepares the way for his steps.*

I do not think the time is right yet that this world of peace will be here soon, but wherever God goes, righteousness goes before Him and prepares this world for what is coming, for God cannot enter a world of sin and unrighteousness, therefore His righteousness has to come first.
