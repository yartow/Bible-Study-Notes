# Psalm 94
*Psalm 94:1-3 NIV*

*The Lord is a God who avenges. O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, Judge of the earth; pay back to the proud what they deserve. How long, Lord , will the wicked, how long will the wicked be jubilant?*

I must remember that the Lord is a God Who *avenges*. He will not leave me to death, He will save me or avenge me for what my adversaries have done to me.
Moses asks here how long it will last before the Lord comes.

*Psalm 94:4-7 NIV*

*They pour out arrogant words; all the evildoers are full of boasting. They crush your people, Lord ; they oppress your inheritance. They slay the widow and the foreigner; they murder the fatherless. They say, “The Lord does not see; the God of Jacob takes no notice.”*

Boasting is part of their evilness. They do not recognize You and therefore no problem see Your power either. They think everything was done by their own power.
They think they do not owe You anything and therefore crush Your people. They think they can get away with it, because of their arrogance they think they are stronger than You.
They do everything You forbade, instead of taking extra care of the widows, the fatherless and the foreigners, they do the opposite, they slay them!
Punish them for this, O Lord, You alone can give them what they deserve.

*Psalm 94:8-11 NIV*

*Take notice, you senseless ones among the people; you fools, when will you become wise? Does he who fashioned the ear not hear? Does he who formed the eye not see? Does he who disciplines nations not punish? Does he who teaches mankind lack knowledge? The Lord knows all human plans; he knows that they are futile.*

All that these evil people do is futile, and they do not even know it themselves. They do not know what that the Lord knows everything they are thinking. Every plan they have is already known and foreseen by God. He created them, how could He not know?
How can they think God will not punish them? He disciplines whole nations, bans them, exiles them, kills them, and everything in it, children and women as well, how could he not punish a few people who have done things far worse?

*Psalm 94:12-15 NIV*

*Blessed is the one you discipline, Lord , the one you teach from your law; you grant them relief from days of trouble, till a pit is dug for the wicked.*

By teaching and rebuking us, disciplining and even punishing us, You prevent from falling into the pit dug for the wicked. This pit is for those who never get disciplined and think they can just walk anywhere they want. They do not listen to directions or stop when they have to and therefore fall in the pit that God warned them for.

*For the Lord will not reject his people; he will never forsake his inheritance.*

With *inheritance* probably meant both God's inheritance, His spiritual wisdom and knowledge, His love and care; as well as us, as we are the ones called to pass on God's inheritance.
God will never forsake us. God will never forsake His own character and everything He passes on to His children.

*Judgment will again be founded on righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow it.*

God will judge and He will do it based on righteousness. All the upright will *follow* it. What would they follow?
They will follow God's judgment, I think. Whatever punishment or reward He has for us, we will gladly accept, in order to grow more like Him.
It could also mean we follow God in basing our judgment on righteousness. So when we judge people, we do not do it by outer appearance.

*Psalm 94:16-19 NIV*

*Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for me against evildoers? Unless the Lord had given me help, I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death.*

No one can help us but God. No one will help us but God. That is what it means to me to say "my God is all in all".

*When I said, “My foot is slipping,” your unfailing love, Lord , supported me. When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought me joy.*

Amen to the Lord. His consolation is worth more than gold, it brings more happiness than anything else in this world. It is proof of His existence and His love and care for us.

*20 Can a corrupt throne be allied with you—*
*a throne that brings on misery by its decrees?*

The very concept of a king was brought into this world by You. The one who rules and reigns over a country, caring for its people and avenging her by going into war with other countries.
But the kings of this world are far from what You had in mind. Corruption, dictatorship in the most negative sense and losing power by constitutional monarchies and other political systems, are just examples of how Your idea has been corrupted.
The world does not even know that the idea of a king was created by You. How can they ever go back?

*21 The wicked band together against the righteous*
*and condemn the innocent to death.*

The wicked are not *just* wicked, they keep doing things to become more wicked. The band together, think of plans, not just to obtain money from people, but to specifically attack the righteous. The satan leads them. that is obvious. 

*22 But the Lord has become my fortress,*
*and my God the rock in whom I take refuge.*
*23 He will repay them for their sins*
*and destroy them for their wickedness;*
*the Lord our God will destroy them.*

Never let your sentence end at hopelessness. Know that there is always an end, and it does not, it never ends, with, but it does end with God conquering evil.

God is my fortress, and He is my Rock. He will never fall, He is always at the beginning. He will make sure we do not fall, except for falling back on Him. He is a mighty fortress and nothing will penetrate His walls. Anyone who does, will see the wrath of the Lord.
