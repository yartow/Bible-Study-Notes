# Psalm 58
*Psalm 58:1-5 NIV*

*Do you rulers indeed speak justly? Do you judge people with equity? No, in your heart you devise injustice, and your hands mete out violence on the earth.*

Even in his time David knew that rulers care about one thing only, and that is themselves. People have not changed through the ages, inequality and injustice are common to those who only think of themselves.

*Even from birth the wicked go astray; from the womb they are wayward, spreading lies. Their venom is like the venom of a snake, like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears, that will not heed the tune of the charmer, however skillful the enchanter may be.*

David also knew of the Indian snake sorcerers and that what they did was fake. A snake is poisonous, does not and cannot listen to anyone, and its venom will kill you.
The lesson is to be not try to convince a or help a snake.
Although I am wondering whether it is true that they gave been bad from birth.

*Psalm 58:6-8 NIV*

*Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; Lord , tear out the fangs of those lions! Let them vanish like water that flows away; when they draw the bow, let their arrows fall short. May they be like a slug that melts away as it moves along, like a stillborn child that never sees the sun.*

David wishes the worst there is for his enemies.

*Psalm 58:9-11 NIV*

*Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns— whether they be green or dry—the wicked will be swept away.*

Betekenis van het vers hierboven.

*The righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they dip their feet in the blood of the wicked. Then people will say, “Surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who judges the earth.”*

People must see things before they understand that God judges the earth. Indeed, He will make the righteous conquer, although that may take a while and all the while people will think there is no God, or that God is not righteous.
