# Psalm 23
*The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.*

The first thing I need to know is that I lack nothing.

*He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he refreshes my soul.*

The Lord lets me cool off, when I am angry, He will take my wrath away and put it on Himself. He gives me new energy which I can easily tap from. He refreshes me mentally, morally. He gives me opportunities to think things over and gives me answers.

*He guides me along the right paths for his nameâ€™s sake.*

To be a witness, but also to lead the other sheep, so the Shepherd can take care of other sheep. To grow myself, I will learn to grow more when I stay on the right track.

*Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.*

Once again I need to be reminded that God is with me, always, that I should not fear. God's tools are more than sufficient to rescue me from the enemy. I have other Christians to pray for me, my helmet of salvation and shield of prayer.

*You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely your goodness and love will follow* *me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. (Psalm 23:1-6 NIV)*

Is dat aan het hoofd van de tafel? Nee, maar het zalven duidt aan dat David de eregast is en ook al zijn zijn vijanden ook te gast, zij mogen toekijken hoe David gezalfd wordt. Dat is wat eer geeft aan David.
You give me honor in front of my enemies, I do not have to obtain this myself, but You give this to me. You make me feel so special, as if the whole world is about me. You give me more goodness than I can handle.
