# Psalm 11
Could it be that this part is meant for me? Could it be that I am the one who is fleeing for the difficulties in church? In a sense I am letting the foundation be destroyed, because I know I could be letting people down.

On the other hand, I need to know that *the Lord is in His holy temple* and that *He observes the sons of men*, which means that He is watching and would not allow anything to happen that is not according to His will. 
The dilemma then lies in whether I have done my best, my utmost, to do whatever I can as far as it is within my power.
I know that until recently it seemed wise to not suggest or initiate any more ideas, and I had done my best and it seemed best - in order to keep the peace with the authorities - that I retreat. However, now it seems that the authorities have come to terms with me and admit they appreciate my ideas.
It seems better to let the heat cool down just a little bit more before getting back.

I am afraid though that I am withdrawing for the wrong reasons.
