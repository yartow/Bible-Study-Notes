# Psalm 143
*Lord , hear my prayer, listen to my cry for mercy; in your faithfulness and righteousness come to my relief. Do not bring your servant into judgment, for no one living is righteous before you.*

I know I cannot stand before You. In my arrogance I oppose many people, but before You I know I am less than worthy. I am even honored if You are willing to punish me. But still, because of Jesus' sacrifice, I am boldly enough to ask You, do not judge me, Lord. I know I am not righteous, I cannot say I know what punishment awaits me in hell, but what I can think of already is too much for me.

I need Your relief. I thank You for giving me brothers and sisters in church, and in the world wide Church, Your body, who are praying for me and giving me comfort.

*The enemy pursues me, he crushes me to the ground; he makes me dwell in the darkness like those long dead. So my spirit grows faint within me; my heart within me is dismayed.*

The enemy has always been stronger than I *.*
It has always been because of Your image that the Satan did not dare to come close to me. But as soon as I lose that image, I notice the Satan's influence in my life.

*I remember the days of long ago; I meditate on all your works and consider what your hands have done.*

You are a living God, I know that because I keep seeing You before me. In my mind I keep thinking about what You have done for me in the past and I see the results You have made right before. My beautiful child Nathan was not made by Sandra and me, but You formed him and let him filter out the bad things of us. Help us in raising him, oh Lord.
My wife Sandra was specifically chosen by You, no one understands but she, and no woman could love me except for her.
Thank You for Your wonderful works and design, not just the designs of Your work, but how my life is going day by day with all these little "coincidences", which were all planned by You in advance. I praise You for Your perfect work.

**I spread out my hands to you; I thirst for you like a parched land.**
*Psalm 143:1-6 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.143.1-6.NIV*

I long so much for You, Lord. I wish to be removed from this world in order to be with You. I know that is selfish, but I am just exclaiming how I long to be with You. Or if I am really honest, it is to escape the troubles of this world as well. The pressure of being or becoming an elder in church, and of finding a new career are weighing heavy upon my shoulders.
Give me strength, Lord, to not carry this by myself but to have my brothers and sisters pray for me.

*Answer me quickly, Lord ; my spirit fails. Do not hide your face from me or I will be like those who go down to the pit.*

I need Your help as soon as possible. From my experiences I know that as soon as I lose You out of sight, that is when I am disobedient, the devil has power over me. And every minute he has power over me, I change, I influence others negatively, my fate seems to be sealed.
That is why I need to be close You always.

*Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love, for I have put my trust in you. Show me the way I should go, for to you I entrust my life.*

I know, though, that these periods always have an end, and that in the next phase You are present to save me. I have put my trust in You, I know You will not let me down.
Whichever way You show me, I know it gives me life, and I will go that way.

*Rescue me from my enemies, Lord , for I hide myself in you. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; may your good Spirit lead me on level ground.*
*Psalm 143:7-10 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.143.7-10.NIV*

You have taught me that another way to be rescued from my enemies, can also be to see them differently, to see them as my friends.
But in order to do that I need to do Your will and that is difficult. Teach me, Lord, how to do that. Lead me to level ground, which is ground on which I have peace with my fellowmen.

*For your name’s sake, Lord , preserve my life; in your righteousness, bring me out of trouble.*

I know You are righteous, You are even righteousness itself! Therefore everything You do will never conflict righteousness. So if I deserve trouble give it to me, and when I ask You to bring me out of it, please bring me out of it as long as it is according to Your righteousness.
Only preserve my life, not because I want it or because of any benefit for my family, but for Your Name's sake only.

*In your unfailing love, silence my enemies; destroy all my foes, for I am your servant.*
*Psalm 143:11-12 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.143.11-12.NIV*

And just as I ask You to silence my enemies and destroy my foes, I ask You to do that in your unfailing love. Because if I had done it, I would destroy them without mercy, neglecting all kinds of factors and judging too fast. But when You do it, You do it out of love for me and my enemies.
I am Your servant, my life is in Your mighty hands. Therefore I ask You to protect me, but if You decide to give me over to my enemies, I will silently obey Your command.
