# Psalm 97 (LSB)
### Remember His Holy Name
**Psa. 97:1**   	aYahweh 1reigns, let the bearth rejoice; 
	Let the many ccoastlands be glad.
**2** 	aClouds and thick darkness are all around Him; 
	bRighteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.
**3** 	aFire goes before Him 
	And bburns up His adversaries all around.
**4** 	His alightnings light up the world; 
	The earth sees and btrembles.
**5** 	The mountains amelt like wax at the presence of Yahweh, 
	At the presence of the bLord of the whole earth.
**6** 	The aheavens declare His righteousness, 
	And ball the peoples see His glory.

**Psa. 97:7**   Let all those be ashamed who serve agraven images, 
	Who boast of bidols; 
	1cWorship Him, all you 2gods!

When I was reading this image of a scene appeared to me where many were worshipping idols, in the form of statues of poles. Each person had his own idol and was offering food or other stuff to it. Something was happening in the background, like fire coming down from heaven and all the people looked up witha kind of envy, because their own gods did not show any of these powers. Of course that power was from the Almighty God.
Perhaps I made up this image myself or perhaps it was given by God, but this is what I think this verse means. All the worshippers of these idols should worship Yahweh, of course, but even the gods whom they worship.

In Hebrews 1:6 **gods** is cited as **angels**. We know that the term "sons of God" can refer to angels and kings, and "gods" to leaders of a country, as in #todo/opzoeken was it this psalm that used the term "gods"? but that it is used for "angels" I did not know. Apparently so, for the author of Hebrews wrote that through divine inspiration. 

**8** 	Zion 1heard*this* and awas glad, 
	And the daughters of Judah have rejoiced 
	Because of Your judgments, O Yahweh.
**9** 	For You are Yahweh aMost High over all the earth; 
	You are exalted far babove all 1gods.

**Psa. 97:10**   aHate evil, you who love Yahweh, 
	Who bkeeps the souls of His holy ones; 
	He cdelivers them from the hand of the wicked.
**11** 	aLight is sown for the righteous 
	And bgladness for the upright in heart.
**12** 	Be aglad in Yahweh, you righteous ones, 
	And bgive thanks for the remembrance of 1His holy*name*.
