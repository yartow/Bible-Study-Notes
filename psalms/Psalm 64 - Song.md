# Psalm 64 - Song
*Psalm 64:1 NIV*

*Hear me, my God, as I voice my complaint; protect my life from the threat of the enemy.*

God hears me. He hears my every thought, every single thought I have thought of and every little wish I have wished for. He knows what I feel at every moment of the day, every tingle in the least one toes, He knows, for He is God.
Not a distant God, but One Who is near me, in my heart, never leaving me behind and always by my side to protect me, to lead me, to watch over me and to support me.
All around me, around the year. Every day and minute of way I walk with Him, I trust in Him, I give Him my life for He has given me life. A new life I could never have dreamt of, a new beginning only God could have known of.
My life, no, it is God's life right now, because I belong to Him. I vow, and all this I keep within my heart, and He gives me a brand new start.
