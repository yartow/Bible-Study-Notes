# Psalm 95
*Psalm 95:1-2 NIV*

*Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord ; let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation.*

Never forget to sing for the Lord, no matter whether you sing well or bad. You cannot do it "too often" for there are too many reasons to thank Him for.
You cannot do it too hard, for He is worth an unlimited amount of praise. No instrument must be lacking, no song must be forgotten.

*Let us come before him with thanksgiving and extol him with music and song.*

And do all this before Him, do not be afraid to sing, go to where He is. If you look for Him, He will be there for you.
It does not matter whether you play an instrument, use your voice or have any other role. As long as it is with thanksgiving, He will accept You.

*Psalm 95:3-5 NIV*

*For the Lord is the great God, the great King above all gods. In his hand are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to him. The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.*

The Lord God Almighty owns it all. He owns the mountains and the seas. The depths of the earth, deeper than men has ever gone to, and but a dimple in His hand. The sea with its crushing pressure at the bottom is merely a drop of water in His palm.
We cannot imagine how big He is. We cannot even imagine how deep our ocean is.

*Psalm 95:6-7 NIV*

*Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker; for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care.*

If only man realized the power of the Lord, they would all bow down for Him. We would also realize that He is our maker, our God, the One Who takes care of us, and that we are His sheep. If only we view Him as our father, we would know how much He loves us and we would obey Him for this reason, instead of out of fear or because it is His command.

*Today, if only you would hear his voice,*
*“Do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah, as you did that day at Massah in the wilderness, where your ancestors tested me; they tried me, though they had seen what I did. For forty years I was angry with that generation; I said, ‘They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they have not known my ways.’ So I declared on oath in my anger, ‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ”*

Please unharden my heart, Lord. You know that sin has covered my heart and that I cannot hear Your voice well. It is as if I am trying You right now. After so many warnings and so many forgivings I still sin, not only hardened I'm heart but in mind as well. Not even a donkey makes the same mistake twice, but I do.
Do not stay angry at me for a long time, I pray, Lord, but I cannot ask You to shorten this period of forty years, because I deserve that or even more. But I leave it up to You and live by Your grace and mercy.
*For only in grace can I enter Your rest.*
