# Psalm 32
*Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.* *Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord does not count against them and in whose spirit is no deceit.*
 
 
I am blessed by You, Lord, because You have covered my sins. I know that all the sins I have done will be eradicated from Your book eventually and that my spirit will remain pure.
 
 
*When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.*
*For day and night your hand was heavy on me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer.*
 
 
I know the difference between speaking up and being forgiven by You and just keeping silent about it. Sins eats away my flesh, it tears my bones and destroys my heart from the inside out.
Indeed, it felt like my strength was sapped, it just ... Away.

TODO VLOEIDE?
 
 
*Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity.*
*I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord.” And you forgave the guilt of my sin. (Psalm 32:1-5 NIV)*  
 
Everything, as far as I know, comes to good when I acknowledge my sins to You,

*Therefore let all the faithful pray to you while you may be found; surely the rising of the mighty waters will not reach them.*
*You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance. (Psalm 32:6, 7 NIV)*
 
 
I should be careful and know that You can not always be found. There may be times that You on purpose will not speak to me or hide Yourself from me. Let me pray to while I still can, do not let me waste a single chance.
If You hide Yourself from me, how will I be protected from everything around me and all the bad inside of me? Please do not leave me alone, for I would not be able to hold out even one second. Leave me Your strength, God, and Your wisdom.
 
 
*I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.*
*Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you.*
*Many are the woes of the wicked, but the Lord ’s unfailing love surrounds the one who trusts in him.*
 
 
I must thank the Lord for giving me the character of a follower, that I do not need a bit and bridle to obey You. But I owe it to You in the first place. There were times, and there still are, that I do need a bit and that I need to be steered by You. Thank You for always being so patient and gentle with me. Thank You that I have grown to this level.
Please give this part of my character to my fellow believers as well, let them share in it and enjoy Your presence as God and as friend.

*Rejoice in the Lord and be glad, you righteous; sing, all you who are upright in heart! (Psalm 32:8-11 NIV)*
 
 
The righteous have a reason for joy, to sing and to be glad. For them each day is a new day to see new wonders of God, to see His unconditional love once more, to hope in His everlasting promises and to have peace in being forgiven, redeemed and saved by our Lord Jesus Christ.
