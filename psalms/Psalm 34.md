# Psalm 34
*Psalm 34:1-3 NIV*

*I will extol the Lord at all times; his praise will always be on my lips.*
*I will glory in the Lord ; let the afflicted hear and rejoice.*
*Glorify the Lord with me; let us exalt his name together.*

At all times, the afflicted as well, together. If I am correct, these form the theme of this Psalm of praise.
I was wondering what story is Psalm would be about, for what reason does David praise God? Except for the sentence, it is not known, but it is not necessary either. The main thought of this verse is, praise should always happen, that is it.

The first verse speaks of the story where David is brought before Abimelek and probably would have been killed if he had not pretended to be insane. Still it is the Lord's mercy to let Abimelek believe this and Mae the decision to drive David away, to let him go.

It is beautiful to see that David still praises the Lord and keeps on doing so, after losing his whole kingdom to one of his sons, losing his family as well, losing all he is when he is brought without stature to another king.
In fact, I think that David thought something like what Job said in Job 1:21

*Naked I came from my mother's womb...*

You cannot lose anything, for nothing was yours to begin with, and everything is still in the hands of the Lord (so nothing is lost).

*I will glory in the Lord ; let the afflicted hear and rejoice.*

The second verse focuses on the afflicted, those who have "lost" a lot in their lives as well. David now has been an afflicted one and still is one at the moment of writing (at least, after this happening). David is saying,
*Even you, afflicted ones, may be happy because the Lord is here. He will take care of your problems. Nothing is as bad as losing the Lord's favor, and nothing is as good as knowing Him and experiencing His grace.*

*Psalm 34:4-7 NIV*

*I sought the Lord , and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears. Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame. This poor man called, and the Lord heard him; he saved him out of all his troubles. The angel of the Lord* *encamps* *around those who fear him, and he delivers them.*

Seek the Lord, and He will answer you. Why does this not happen to everyone? I know some people who want to hear God. Could it be because they do not fear Him?
Do not respect Him, do not know God is watching them the time?
Or because they do not know what fearing God is?

*Psalm 34:8-14 NIV*

*Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the one who takes refuge in him. Fear the Lord , you his holy people, for those who fear him lack nothing.*
*The lions may grow weak and hungry, but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.*

It does not matter how strong you are, eventually we all grow weak. What matters is where we get our strength from.

*Come, my children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord .*
*Whoever of you loves life and desires to see many good days, keep your tongue from evil and your lips from telling lies. Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.*

So how do you learn the fear of the Lord? *Keep* yourself from evil, that is among others gossip, and lies. Not just one day, but every day, no weekends excepted the *always*. 
*Turn* from evil, so do not dwell in it, do not think you can handle the temptation, do not find excuses to stay in it, just go and turn away from it. 
*Seek* peace and *pursue* it. Do not stop until you have found it. And when you have found it, do not stop, but pursue it by doing everything you can to maintain it. 

*Psalm 34:15-16 NIV*

*The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are attentive to their cry;*
*but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to blot out their name from the earth.*

If you want your name to be a legacy on this world, which you should not, do not do evil, for the Lord will blot out your name.
Instead of wanting people to know your name, focus your acts on God hearing it and seeing it. How? Very simple, be righteous and cry out to Him.
Whenever you need help, ask Him,

*Psalm 34:17-18 NIV*

*The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.*

So, would God be close to those whose heart is not broken? I think it means that when you're is heart is not broken, it is hard and nothing can enter it. Those people do not want God near them.

**The righteous person may have many troubles, but the Lord delivers him from them all; he protects all his bones, not one of them will be broken. (Psalm 34:19, 20 NIV)**

The Lord has never said we will never get any troubles, rather yet Jesus has promised us that we *will* get them, we will be persecuted and we must bear our own cross. But God has also promised us that through these troubles we will only get stronger, develop persistence and character (Corintihians ?). 
What is likely meant by bones is that bones may be broken and *may* heal, and if they heal they will be stronger but deformed, but not always is there a chance of healing. However, if one is hurt but nothing is broken, the healing will be much faster.
TODO I am not really sure of this meaning though because I do see some things happening in lives of righteous people, that take a very long time in healing.

*Psalm 34:21-22 NIV*

*Evil will slay the wicked; the foes of the righteous will be condemned.*
*The Lord will rescue his servants; no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.*

Evil will even slay its own people, God will never do that. Rather He will destroy His foes.
This means that even though I do evil, I am not evil, and God will always come to the rescue, because I am His *servant*.
