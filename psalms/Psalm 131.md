# Psalm 131
*My heart is not proud, Lord , my eyes are not haughty;*

I do not know if I can say with certainty what David is saying here. Is my heart not proud? Only You know for sure, Lord. I think it is, I am proud of what I have done and what I am able of and others are not. But I realize that everything I do have is because of You.

*I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me.*

Of course I have major projects on my list and these are too wonderful for me, but not for You.
As a matter of concern, it depends on how he defines is. I do not concern myself with it, but I let You decide which matters should concern me.

*But I have calmed and quieted myself, I am like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child I am content.*

In that sense I am calm and content. I have nothing to worry about. The projects are chosen by the Lord, the size of the projects are according to His power and my faith in Him. Only one thing, the fact that I have a choice to do a project for Him, and which one it is, which I cannot clearly hear, that makes me a little restless.
But I am content, because I know my Father cares for me.

*Israel, put your hope in the Lord both now and forevermore.*
*Psalm 131:1-3 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.131.1-3.NIV*

Only by putting my hope in the Lord I can be saved. This is not contemporary, this is true even a thousand or million years from now.
