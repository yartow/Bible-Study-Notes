# Psalm 97 (NIV)
*Psalm 97:1-6 NIV*

*The Lord reigns, let the earth be glad; let the distant shores rejoice. Clouds and thick darkness surround him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.* **Fire goes before him and consumes his foes on every side.**

The Lord is not always easily approachable. He is King after all. He sits on a throne so high we can never reach. His standard of righteousness and justice are way above ours. It is clear that every contact we ever have with Him is only through His grace.

*His lightning lights up the world; the earth sees and trembles. The mountains melt like wax before the Lord , before the Lord of all the earth.*

No light is ever so bright to light up the world as lightning **.** One flash and everything is visible for a moment. As much as we know about and have seen of this light, which is almost nothing, this much we know about God. But what we have seen of Him already shows He is mightier than we can ever imagine. 
Is there anything that can make mountains afraid and melt like wax? Nothing here on Earth can do that, but God can.

*The heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all peoples see his glory.*

Heaven itself proclaims God's righteousness.
TODO What would that mean?
God has said that He lets it rain over the righteousness and unrighteous. Perhaps that is His righteousness.
Or it could refer to that all animals have their purpose, everything in nature has its purpose, there are stronger animals, but there are also smarter and faster animals. There is no king of the jungle. Everything stays in balance.

*Psalm 97:7 NIV*

*All who worship images are put to shame, those who boast in idolsâ€” worship him, all you gods!*

I do not know exactly how these people are put to shame except for examples where God wins and their idol loses. They will be put to shame in other ways as well, I think, as in receiving no answer from their god, no action of their god and not getting prosperity, both materially and spiritually, or peace in their hearts.

*Psalm 97:8-12 NIV*

*Zion hears and rejoices and the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments, Lord . For you, Lord , are the Most High over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods.*

No people would be glad because of judgment, except from You, Lord. When You judge us You do it righteously. Justice will only prevail when You are the judge.

*Let those who love the Lord hate evil, for he guards the lives of his faithful ones and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.*

I must have evil for God is guarding my life (with His life (added)) and if I do not hate evil I would be mocking God.
Delivers me from the hand of the wicked, I would be a fool to return back to the devil and waste all the effort God has put into saving me.
Surely, it is easy for God to save me, but He needs to pay to set me free as well. It will cost Him as much as it costs me, no matter how rich He is. Sin is not measured in money, but in pain, pain that Jesus now suffered for my cause.

*Light shines on the righteous and joy on the upright in heart. Rejoice in the Lord , you who are righteous, and praise his holy name.*

What do you do when you have a discussion with another believer? God's light shines on both him and you, on those who are righteous and joyful.
The answer is not really what I was looking for, and I am not even sure if this is the answer, but God does not give us answers we are looking for but answers we need.
It is *rejoice in the Lord always and praise His holy Name*. In other words, stop fighting, and rejoice together and praise God's Name for everything He has done.
