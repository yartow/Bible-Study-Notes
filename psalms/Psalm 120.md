# Psalm 120
*http://bible.com/111/psa.120.1-2.niv*
*I call on the Lord in my distress, and he answers me.*

In every kind of distress You answer us when we call. If we have not caused this upon ourselves, You answer.
After the exile there was a time that You were silent, I think, but now that we have the Holy Spirit, You have not been silent for two thousand years.

*Save me, Lord , from lying lips and from deceitful tongues.*

I cannot stand it if people around me lie, because I know I am in a sinful environment then. Save me and let escape that environment, Lord.

*http://bible.com/111/psa.120.3-4.niv*
*What will he do to you, and what more besides, you deceitful tongue?*

I am wondering what kind of punishment these lying people will get. Consciously lying all day long, fixing a lie with another lie.
I have done it myself, it was tiring and destroying me on the inside.

*He will punish you with a warriorâ€™s sharp arrows, with burning coals of the broom bush.*

An arrow kills everything and fire burns everything. Coals burn everything slowly which is even more painful and it takes a lot longer to extinguish the heat.
That is the punishment I have received for my part in lying. There is much more punishment for me to be received, but I have not seen it yet, because Jesus has taken it on the cross.

*http://bible.com/111/psa.120.5-7.niv Woe to me that I dwell in Meshek, that I live among the tents of Kedar! Too long have I lived among those who hate peace. I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.*

Living between these people is not good for me. I might become just like them *.*
Help me, Lord, to be saved, if not in body then in spirit, to not sin like they do.

TODO OPZOEKEN Meshek and Kedar
