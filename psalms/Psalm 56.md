# Psalm 56
*Psalm 56:1-2 NIV*

*Be merciful to me, my God, for my enemies are in hot pursuit; all day long they press their attack. My adversaries pursue me all day long; in their pride many are attacking me.*

Dear God, especially in these long pursuits I need Your help. I am very bad at defending myself for very long times, I get tired easily.
And now, my adversaries are attacking me know all day long, pursuing me, from really close.
I cannot make it if You are not there with me, Lord. I want to stop running and fight them, with Your power.
But they are proud, they think they can attack the Lord, with or without their weapons. They do not understand that are the One Who made these weapons and let them invent it. You are ruler over all our thoughts. We are merely clay in Your hand.
*Psalm 56:3-4 NIV*

*When I am afraid, I put my trust in you. In God, whose word I praise— in God I trust and am not afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?*

I am not afraid if You are there with me, for I know You will protect You and men are not even worthy to fight with You. With Your little pinky finger You can blow them away.
And what can they do to me if You are here to protect me?

*Psalm 56:5-7 NIV*

*All day long they twist my words; all their schemes are for my ruin. They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps, hoping to take my life.*
*Because of their wickedness do not let them escape; in your anger, God, bring the nations down.*

Dear Father, I am glad to say that nothing of the magnitude of what David is going through here has ever happened to me. Although of course there have been moments when I felt like I was the only person they were set up against.

Lord, let me know if I am allowed to pray for their downfall. Am I allowed to allow hatred to enter my heart and vengeance, though it is Yours?

*Psalm 56:8-9 NIV*

*Record my misery; list my tears on your scroll — are they not in your record? Then my enemies will turn back when I call for help. By this I will know that God is for me.*

You know how much sadness I have had in certain moments of my life. I am glad You know, because no one else knows.
And I also know how many times You have helped, it is countless, but I know for sure that it has been *every* time. 
I do not understand how people can go through suffering and sadness without You, Lord. How do they do that? Where do they find comfort?

*Psalm 56:10-11 NIV*

*In God, whose word I praise,*
*in the Lord , whose word I praise— in God I trust and am not afraid. What can man do to me?*

It seems like David is talking to both God the Father and the Son, and Jesus Christ.
He understands the power they have and realizes, if They are my protectors, what can man do, who were made by Them as well?
It is strange, however, to see that David is so afraid at other times.

*Psalm 56:12-13 NIV*

*I am under vows to you, my God; I will present my thank offerings to you. For you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.*

Not only do we thank God, we are under vows to obey Him the rest of our lives and even for these vows we thank Him.

It is through the help of God that we can walk before God. That sounds strange, but it means that without God's help we would not be able to know God.
