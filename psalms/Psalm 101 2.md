# Psalm 101
*Psalm 101:1-4 NIV*

*I will sing of your love and justice; to you, Lord , I will sing praise. I will be careful to lead a blameless lifeâ€” when will you come to me?*

I want to You to be proud of me, therefore I want to lead a blameless life. I want to love You like David did, and obey You like Joseph.
I want to praise You for everything, whether good or bad, like Paul, who was content in everything. So many people throughout the years have been good examples to me, I hope to be a good example to others as well.

*I will conduct the affairs of my house with a blameless heart.*

I want to keep my house clean, that means that I have to be clean as well and I have to keep my family members clean.
I, as a father, carry this responsibility for my family.

*I will not look with approval on anything that is vile. I hate what faithless people do; I will have no part in it.*

I do not want to be mixed up in affairs of faithless people and of heathens. I only want to be involved in Your Kingdom.
Of course if I have to help others in a vile area then I will do that.

*The perverse of heart shall be far from me; I will have nothing to do with what is evil.*

This is very difficult for me, Lord, because I am perverse of heart as well. I just hope I will not be affecting anyone with my perversity.
Keep me far away from all evil and protect me against every influence or distraction.
I need Your help on this, Lord.

*Psalm 101:5 NIV*

*Whoever slanders their neighbor in secret, I will put to silence; whoever has haughty eyes and a proud heart, I will not tolerate.*

Help me, Lord, to know the right way to interpret and act on this verse. Let me not use violence or wrong methods.

On the other hands, give me strength to not tolerate slander.

*Psalm 101:6*

*6 My eyes will be on the faithful in the land,*
*that they may dwell with me;*
*the one whose walk is blameless*
*will minister to me.*

Unfortunately, the Silent Time devotional I wrote here is missing because my other phone did not synchronize. What I wrote here though, was that my hope is on a country where the leader is blameless and chooses blameless ministers or whatever helpers as well.
Perhaps it was not right for me to write down the name of that person here, whom I thought of as immoral or not fit for leadership; or perhaps it is that I look down on him while I myself am full of sin as well.
 
 
*Psalm 101:7-8*
*7 No one who practices deceit*
*will dwell in my house;*
*no one who speaks falsely*
*will stand in my presence.*
 

I am not sure whether Moses or David is saying this, but both God's house, the temple or the church, as well a the government must be free of deceit.
I must take this as a reminder for myself in the first place. Do not deceive people with your outer appearance, not keeping promises.
 
*8 Every morning I will put to silence*
*all the wicked in the land;*
*I will cut off every evildoer*
*from the city of the Lord.*
