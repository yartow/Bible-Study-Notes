# Psalm 122
*Psalm 122*
*A song of ascents. Of David.*
 
*1 I rejoiced with those who said to me,*
*“Let us go to the house of the Lord.”*
*2 Our feet are standing*
*in your gates, Jerusalem.*
 
 Dear Father, I pray for Your mercy, for I need Your peace and hope in me, like a fountain welling up in me. Overflowing and giving to others as well. 
I am standing on the morning of our summer conference, not well enough prepared, for both this important task as well as for everything that comes with it. I am not prepared for any extra personal matters or anything going wrong, but I need Your help with that, because there will always be something different from what we planned.
 
 
*3 Jerusalem is built like a city*
*that is closely compacted together.*
 
 
I know I cannot compare Jerusalem with the summer conference, but the similarities are striking. At the summer conference it is where the different churches go up to praise Your Name, but also is it the place where evangelism, discipleship, ministry and worship take place, as well as being part of Your family.
Along with that much hatred and many conflicts.
Please let Your Spirit reign over us so that not we, but Your Spirit will be speaking through us.
 
*4 That is where the tribes go up—*
*the tribes of the Lord—*
*to praise the name of the Lord*
*according to the statute given to Israel.*
 
 
Now at the summer conference I fortunately see less friction than I initially expected. Thank You, Lord, for giving me hope for this. I need Your strength, both physically, mentally and spiritually.
Physically because I am tired of not sleeping enough and using my voice too much, mentally because also because of my sleep deprivation and the lack of inspiration I need to compose classes, and spiritually because I am pouring out so much, but receiving so little.
These words of prayer are the only direct contact I have with throughout the day.
I thank You that everyone here has come to praise Your Name, o Lord, and we teach our children to praise Your Name as well.
 
*5 There stand the thrones for judgment,*
*the thrones of the house of David.*
 
 
We praise Your Name, we do it figuratively in Jerusalem, but we know that that is the place of judgment as well. We know You are righteous. Therefore let us praise You in the right way, with our sincere hearts and not with mere words and gestures. Let us teach the next generations how to praise You sincerely with all of their hearts, minds, souls and strength.
 
*6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:*
*“May those who love you be secure.*
 
 
Now I understand, David is asking me to pray for Jerusalem that the people in His city are secure (those who love You). Father, I do not know how it feels to be a Jew or a part of Your congregation in Jerusalem, seeing the big temple that was once there. I can imagine though how it must have felt, an amazing place and no place on Earth closer than this to You, but still miles away.
I thank You that I do not have to imagine what it feels like to actually feel Your presence, even within me, because You have already shown me.
 
 
*7 May there be peace within your walls*
*and security within your citadels.”*
 
 
I pray that there may be peace in Israel, in Jerusalem, which does not even have walls anymore. Let not the peace be disrupted now that there are no walls anymore.
The Jews currently living in Jerusalem perhaps do not know this verse does not imply for them anymore, but they should know that they can find the peace within Jesus.
 
 
*8 For the sake of my family and friends,*
*I will say, “Peace be within you.”*
 
 
For Jesus will enter our hearts and then peace as well will be within us.
 
*9 For the sake of the house of the Lord our God,*
*I will seek your prosperity.*
