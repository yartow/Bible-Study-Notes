# Psalm 141
*I call to you, Lord , come quickly to me; hear me when I call to you. May my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice.*
*Psalm 141:1-2 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.141.1-2.NIV*

David describes a beautiful symbol of his prayer and the sacrifices for the Lord. Incense is set before the Lord. The evening sacrifice, when it is burned, the smoke will rise up, and so does David raise his hands.

*Set a guard over my mouth, Lord ; keep watch over the door of my lips. Do not let my heart be drawn to what is evil so that I take part in wicked deeds along with those who are evildoers; do not let me eat their delicacies.*
*Psalm 141:3-4 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.141.3-4.NIV*

My mouth, lips and heart all need to stay clean.
If my heart is *drawn in*, I will *take part* in wicked deeds. Please protect my heart, Lord. 
My mouth as well, needs to be protected so that nothings comes in that is evil. At the same time my mouth needs to be guarded so that nothing will come out of it that is evil.
It is not the food of evildoers, but hanging with them which will poison my thoughts.

*Let a righteous man strike me—that is a kindness; let him rebuke me—that is oil on my head. My head will not refuse it, for my prayer will still be against the deeds of evildoers.*
*Psalm 141:5 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.141.5.NIV*

Lord, You have put many righteous men around me and I have many a time been stricken as well. I ask of You to be stricken and rebuked by righteous men.

Put me around righteous and wise men, give me the wisdom to distinguish them from the wicked and to distinguish the wise words from the evil ones.
Let my prayers continue to be blessed by You in whatever form, but may they especially be for protection against evildoers.

*Their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs, and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken.*

We have seen through history that many ancient rulers have been killed, even now, though less frequent, assassination is not uncommon in (politically) undeveloped countries.

*They will say, “As one plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave.”*
*Psalm 141:6-7 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.141.6-7.NIV*

I am not sure what the mouth of the grave means, but this verse is probably saying that even in death or after death the wicked will not lay at peace.

*But my eyes are fixed on you, Sovereign Lord ; in you I take refuge—do not give me over to death. Keep me safe from the traps set by evildoers, from the snares they have laid for me. Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.*
*Psalm 141:8-10 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.141.8-10.NIV*

I fix my eyes on You, Lord, and not on all the other things that happen in life. Whatever happens with my enemies, whether good or wrong, it will not lead me from my path, as long as You do not give me over into their hands. Let the wicked be trapped in their own nets.

I know the devil has set immensely many traps, to even trap me while reading from Your Word, he does not leave any chance unused. I pray that he will get trapped himself, like he has done with Your Son Jesus Christ by killing him and in that way saving humanity.
