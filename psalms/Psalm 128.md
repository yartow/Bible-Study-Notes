# Psalm 128
*Blessed are all who fear the Lord , who walk in obedience to him. You will eat the fruit of your labor; blessings and prosperity will be yours. Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like olive shoots around your table. Yes, this will be the blessing for the man who fears the Lord .*
*Psalm 128:1-4 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.128.1-4.NIV*

Blessings truly come from the Lord alone, and the Lord truly gives His blessings to those who fear Him, as He has promised.
I do not understand though what is the case with people who do not have a wife or cannot have children, but who are fearing the Lord. How can that be explained?
My opinion is that they are blessed as well, though in other ways.

*May the Lord bless you from Zion; may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life. May you live to see your children’s children— peace be on Israel.*
*Psalm 128:5-6 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.128.5-6.NIV*

Should I suppose this Psalm has been written in the context of Jerusalem at that time?
Just like this blessing to see the prosperity of Jerusalem, while one may live not even near there, but it is the highest blessing for Jews at that time, to see prosperity on Jerusalem and to see one's children's children.

If so, then the blessing about having a fruitful wife and many children is also a figure of speech, though applicable to some, but with the intention that one will get the greatest blessing one can get for his time.
