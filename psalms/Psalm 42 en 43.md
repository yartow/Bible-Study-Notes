# Psalm 42 en 43
*Psalm 42:1-4 NIV*

*As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God.*
*My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.*
*When can I go and meet with God?*

This touches me so much! My whole purpose of setting up the Youth Day, CCGN Jongerendag, is all to accomplish but one thing, summarized in this single verse.
*When* can I go? Are young people eager to go, and not able to wait? That is what I am hoping for. 
When can I *go*? This means they want to do something, with their feet, their bodies, their hands and heads. 
And *meet* *with God*? In the end it is all about God. Do they want to go for any reason, or just want to meet with God in any way possible? 

*My tears have been my food day and night, while people say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”*

At the same time I have been crying, inwardly, for all the people, young and old, when they do not know Who God is or where He is, after being in church for so long.
How can they still not know Who He is? How come God has shown Himself to me, and others, but not to some?

*These things I remember as I pour out my soul: how I used to go to the house of God under the protection of the Mighty One with shouts of joy and praise among the festive throng.*

Yes! I remember going to the house of God, all kinds of Christian events have helped me so much in growing, in stirring up the fire within me, allowing the Lord's Holy Spirit to touch me.
All this was not because of my doing, it was by God's grace that I came in touch with these events, God's plan to let me see and hear the right things to touch my heart
*Psalm 42:5 NIV*

*Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.*

This verse is repeated at the end as well. I am wondering whether it means that the part sandwiched between these two verses gives the answer, and yes I have found it. Because in between these two verses there are two sets of two depressing verses as well, and in between those, in the center of it all, is one beautiful comforting verse, like a mountain peak in a valley.

*Psalm 42:8 NIV*

*By day the Lord directs his love, at night his song is with me— a prayer to the God of my life.*

But just like the area in front and behind a mountain is lower, so we must know that our time on earth here is mostly valley like as well.
It does not always look very well, but this mountain of hope is still visible in the past or in the future. And even when it so dark, David calls it *night*, God's song is still with us. What song, what is the meaning of giving a song? A song in the Bible depicts feelings, there are songs of praise, and songs of mourning, but always related to God. So if God gives us a song it means He relates to us. 

*Psalm 42:9-10 NIV*

*I say to God my Rock, “Why have you forgotten me?*
*Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?”*
*My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, “Where is your God?”*

Why I have this trial is logical, because You have told me so. It is to withstand the test and grow stronger, in perseverance, in faith and in wisdom.
Thank You for letting me pass so many times even though I did not do it on my own strength. You did it for me, but You accredited it to me.
I owe You my life, Lord, literally!

*Psalm 42:11 NIV*

*Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me?*
*Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.*

There is a reason why this verse is written three times in these two psalms, not only to sandwich the verses in between and emphasize them, but also to emphasize these this particular verse itself.
In any trial this verse will come back, a soul being downcast and disturbed. Forgetting to put your hope in God is one of the worst things a leader can do, because it does not help out the problem, does not give a good example to his followers, and does not help the leader himself to grow.
A leader needs to be constantly reminded of this.
I will praise the Lord.

*Psalm 43:1-4 NIV*
*Vindicate me, my God, and plead my cause against an unfaithful nation.*
*Rescue me from those who are deceitful and wicked.*

Lord, please save me while I am in the presence of the ungodly. Let me not be overturn by them nor have anything to do with their malpractices. Let me be faithful to You alone, Lord.

Please also let me keep my eyes clear from who my enemies are. Help me not to see you own brothers and sisters as enemies.

*You are God my stronghold. Why have you rejected me?*
*Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?*

It may seem like You have rejected me, it may seem like You have given the devil authority to tempt me, but I must always know that You will never allow the devil to tempt me beyond what I can bear, and I must be aware of the difference between a trial and a temptation.
In this case I need to have some confirmation about what I have done with the CCGN Jongerendag was right or not. I asked the people to give me feedback on those who were spiritually less motivated and who are motivated after the event.
Was I too much in control? Do I want to control processes in other congregations too much?

*Send me your light and your faithful care,*
*let them lead me;*
*let them bring me to your holy mountain,*
*to the place where you dwell.*
*Then I will go to the altar of God,*
*to God, my joy and my delight.*
*I will praise you with the lyre, O God, my God.*
What I need right now is Your leadership, oh Lord, for if I follow my own way, I will surely go the wrong way. A way where I will not worship You, but myself.
I do not have a lyre, but David probably means that he praises God with whatever is given him. I have my piano skills, or in this situation my organizational skills. But how do I praise God with these skills?
Do I have to tell others that God has given me these talents? That seems like boasting to me. Or is the leading of an event such as the CCGN Jongerendag praise already, even if I do not tell others I have organized it?
