# Psalm 134
*Praise the Lord , all you servants of the Lord who minister by night in the house of the Lord . Lift up your hands in the sanctuary and praise the Lord .*

Many Christians serve the Lord. We should all serve Him by day and by night, but some minister Him as well, in his house, which is what we call ministry. Some even have ministry at night, giving courses, pastoral meetings, evening sermons or lectures, or administration to catch up (after their secular job) or formal meetings for church projects.
This Psalm is no compliment for those people. Yet it is a command to call those people to lift up their hands and praise the Lord. Implicitly it is saying *thank the Lord for having this honor if serving Him*. Personally I can testify that without my servanthood my life would have no purpose. It is in my ministry where I can use my talents, where they flourish, where I am accepted and useful. That is all selfish. 
On the other side, it is there where I can help people, motivate and educate them or practically help them with my skills.
I will praise the Lord for giving me this useful life. If I die right now, I will not feel like I have wasted my life. I may not have done more good things than bad things, but if I have been of a little service to the Lord, I am glad.

*May the Lord bless you from Zion, he who is the Maker of heaven and earth.*
*Psalm 134:1-3 NIV*

Now the gift comes from the psalmist, in the form of a blessing from the Lord, which is more than we deserve.
