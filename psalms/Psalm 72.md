# Psalm 72
*Psalm 72:1-2 NIV*

*Endow the king with your justice, O God, the royal son with your righteousness. May he judge your people in righteousness, your afflicted ones with justice.*

Solomon is admitting here that he needs Your justice and righteousness. He knows that his own righteousness is that of the world and that Yours is different.

*Psalm 72:3-7 NIV*

*May the mountains bring prosperity to the people, the hills the fruit of righteousness. May he defend the afflicted among the people and save the children of the needy; may he crush the oppressor.*

What Solomon asks for is in the interest of the Lord, first of all, but second of all for the people.
He asks what is most necessary at the moment and what is worst in his country.
*Corruption* is present and because of that there is injustice. Poverty, perhaps as a cause of corruption, is present, and as I interpret it, there is also extortion. 

*May he endure as long as the sun, as long as the moon, through all generations. May he be like rain falling on a mown field, like showers watering the earth. In his days may the righteous flourish and prosperity abound till the moon is no more.*

Solomon is not only asking this for his generation, but for all generations to come. This means he asks for this righteousness to be on all kings to come.
Let Your righteousness be like rain on earth, letting us not be thirsty for it anymore. Let Your righteousness pour on us and let new things grow.

*Psalm 72:8-11 NIV*

*May he rule from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth. May the desert tribes bow before him and his enemies lick the dust.*

We pray for God's ruling on every piece of the planet. Solomon was wise in also including the desert tribes, for these are so often forgotten, because they hardly seem to have influence on our world, but there is so much violence and idolatry that they need to know about and give their lives to God.
The native people living in the deserts, forests or ice deserts, the Esquimaux, know so much about nature and its medicines, they do not get infected with malaria and ebola it seems, they know how to survive which we can not even with all of our technology, they care more about nature than any of us.

*May the kings of Tarshish and of distant shores bring tribute to him. May the kings of Sheba and Seba present him gifts. May all kings bow down to him and all nations serve him.*

It is very important as well that kings bow down and surrender to God as well, for they are the ones to let their people know about God. They are like fathers responsible for their children's actions and teaching them and letting them grow up in God's presence. They are to give the right example to their people.
Help me to give the right example myself as well, Father, to my family, my church and everyone I am with every day.

*Psalm 72:12-14 NIV*

*For he will deliver the needy who cry out, the afflicted who have no one to help. He will take pity on the weak and the needy and save the needy from death. He will rescue them from oppression and violence, for precious is their blood in his sight.*

God is praiseworthy for many reasons, of which one is that He cares about the needy.
Why has God made some of us strong and others weak? Because He wanted the strong to learn to take care for the weak, just like God does, and the weak to feel cared for, as a blessing from God.
Why has God given us emotions? So that we may feel what God feels towards us, love and pity, and understand why He would sacrifice His only begotten Son.

*Psalm 72:15-17 NIV*

*Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given him.*

I do not fully understand why gold from Sheba is specifically mentioned here. Perhaps it is the far distance, to indicate that people all the way from Ethiopia (is that the same as Sheba?) believe in God, as proof that God not only rules in Israel but in the whole world.

*May people ever pray for him and bless him all day long.*

Why would God need blessings? Or prayer for Himself? Of course we wish that no one will hurt God or insult Him, and that His Name will stand high in awe in everyone's eyes, but to me that still does not sound like a blessing for God.

*May grain abound throughout the land; on the tops of the hills may it sway. May the crops flourish like Lebanon and thrive like the grass of the field. May his name endure forever; may it continue as long as the sun.*

The abundance of grain and crops is put in the same sentence as "*his name endure forever*". The continuation "*as long as the sun*" of course is a euphemism (understatement). 

These verses seem to be sandwiched by verses 15 and 17, which exclaim that God lives forever. In between it blesses God that people should always pray for Him and that He will always give us flourishing crops.

*Then all nations will be blessed through him, and they will call him blessed.*

Originally it said that all nations will *use His Name in blessings*. If God's Name is used in a blessing, you can be sure it is good. 

*Psalm 72:18-20 NIV*

*Praise be to the Lord God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds. Praise be to his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen.*

*This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse.*

Only God does marvelous deeds. What He gives is truly good, no strings attached. Unlike the devil who promises the world, but does not give, and neglecting to say what is in heaven.
We give glory to God alone, everyone should!
