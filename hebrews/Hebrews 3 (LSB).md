# Hebrews 3 (LSB) 
### Jesus Greater than Moses
> **Heb. 3:1**   Therefore, aholy brothers, partakers of a bheavenly calling, consider cthe Apostle and dHigh Priest of our econfession—Jesus, **2** who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as aMoses also was in all His house. **3** aFor He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, in so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house. **4** For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.   

We are called **partakers of a heavenly calling here.** Each Christian has a heavenly calling, even if some do not believe in personal callings. Not only do we have this calling, we *partake*in it, which means we share this calling with other **brothers** (and sisters). This callout is not only to some, not only to the Jews addressed here, but to each one who has been called by God (cf. Romans 8:29f).
Now what is this callout specifically? It is to **consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession—Jesus**. We have to see Him as the Apostle Who started God's Church and the High Priest Who listens to our confessions, both the confessions of our sins and the confession of Who is the greatest God and King of all.
Consider also that this can be interpreted as a calling from heaven.

> **5** Now aMOSES WAS FAITHFUL IN ALL HIS HOUSE AS bA SERVANT, cfor a testimony of those things dwhich were to be spoken later, **6** but Christ*was faithful* as aa Son over His house—bwhose house we are, cif we hold fast our dconfidence and the boast of our ehope.  

We are the house over which Christ rules as a Son, which is the same house as where Moses served in. This means that together with the Israelites we form God's house. The centuries- or perhaps even millenial-old struggle between the Jews and the Christians about who forms the house of God is decided here by this single verse, saying that both form the house, but where the Israelites think that Moses is the leader of the house, the author of Hebrews says that Moses is only the (master) servant and that the real owner is Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Every servant who does not acknowledge Jesus Christ as the Son of God will be #todo/nogaftemaken 
This analogy should not be mixed up with who the children of God are, for there the answer is definitely the Israelites. The Gentiles were never children of God but have been *adopted* into His family. However, the Christians are right in that anyone who does not accept Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the leader of the house of God, will be kicked out of the house. 

> **Heb. 3:7**   Therefore, just as athe Holy Spirit says,   
> 	“bTODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE,  
> **8** 	aDO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS AS 1WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME,   
> 	AS IN THE DAY OF TRIAL IN THE WILDERNESS,  
> **9** 	aWHERE YOUR FATHERS TRIED*Me* BY TESTING*Me*,   
> 	AND SAW MY WORKS FOR bFORTY YEARS.  
> **10** 	“aTHEREFORE I WAS ANGRY WITH THIS GENERATION,   
> 	AND SAID, ‘THEY ALWAYS GO ASTRAY IN THEIR HEART,   
> 	AND THEY DID NOT KNOW MY WAYS’;  
> **11** 	aAS I SWORE IN MY WRATH,   
> 	‘THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.’”  
>   
> **Warning Against Unbelief**  
> **Heb. 3:12**   aSee*to it* brothers, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart 1that falls away from bthe living God. **13** But aencourage one another day after day, as long as it is *still* called “TODAY,” so that none of you will be hardened by the bdeceitfulness of sin. **14** For we have become partakers of Christ, aif we hold fast the beginning of our bassurance firm until the end, **15** while it is said,   
> 	“aTODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE,   
> 	DO NOT   DEN YOUR HEARTS, AS 1WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME.”  

We are God's **house [...], if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope**, and in the same way we are **partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end**. There are conditions on being part of Christ, in both cases we need to hold fast unto something, confidence and assurance, and in the second condition it adds unto that that we need to hold firm until the end. There is no point in holding something fastly and then dropping it right before the finish. 
::Should a person not be rewarded for having held fast all of his life, except at the last moment before his death?:: And if that moment lasted for, say, a year before his death until his death, would the same end result apply for a person such as C.S. Lewis #tags/famouspeople/christian who (might have) lost his faith as well in the period after his wife had died, but who later had faith in God again? We know that what matters is not how long a person has held his faith, but in what state he is at the end of his life. This is first of all because if a person is rewarded, the reward of eternal life is an expression of merit—::and we know that eternal life *cannot be earned* and is *not* one of merit but of *grace*::! Second of all, no one knows when he will be taken away. If someone is taken away early in life, is this to his fortune then or not? If this person held on to the faith at the time he was taken away, it is luck. In this case we would say that a believing child who dies at age six is lucky to have been taken away at this point, for who knows whether he would have held on to his faith if he had died at a later age?

**Example.** Question: does the parabel of the slave who owned the king, was forgiven and then didn't forgive his fellowman show that hell is only temporary (until the slave had paid back everything). 

Righteousness is whether the retribution (the justice) is correct. 

God has the power to create creatures that cannot sin, certain angels for example. 


If C.S. Lewis had been taken away at that moment when he did not have faith, would it have been unrighteous then if he did not get eternal life only because this happened to be at the wrong moment? ::If anyone says that, he is saying that God is not righteous:: for God could have taken him away any moment before or after that, and he *would* have been saved. This, of course, is not true, for this logic would only apply for those who do not adhere to the doctrine of *Once Saved, Always Saved* #biblestudy/theology/calvinism/osas and we know this doctrine is not correct. #todo/nogaftemaken . A person is either saved or he is not, and if he is saved, He will stay saved and never fall off of the faith. If C.S. Lewis was saved before his wife passed away, then even when he was angry with God in the period directly after this, he would still be a believer. I have not read about the doubts he had in this period, but if he was saved, these doubts would have been superficial and never about the power of the saving grace of Christ or God's existence. 

> **Heb. 3:16**   For who aprovoked *Him* when they had heard? Indeed, bdid not all those who came out of Egypt *led* by Moses? **17** And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, awhose corpses fell in the wilderness? **18** And to whom did He swear athat they would not enter His rest, but to those who were bdisobedient? **19***So* we see that they were not able to enter because of aunbelief.  

The conclusion is that the Israelites **were not able to enter because of unbelief**. The author comes to this conclusion because v.14 says that **we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end**. The Israelites   apparently did not hold firm until the end and lost their assurance somewhere along the way, which is synonymous to unbelief. Though this sounds harsh, this is meant as an encouragement to show that all it takes to **enter His rest** is persistent belief until the end.
