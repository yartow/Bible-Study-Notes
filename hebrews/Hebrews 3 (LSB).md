# Hebrews 3 (LSB) 
### Warning Against Neglecting Salvation
**Heb. 2:1**   For this reason we must pay much closer attention to 1what we have heard, lest awe drift away. **2** For if the word aspoken through bangels proved 1unalterable, and cevery trespass and disobedience received a just 2dpenalty, **3** ahow will we escape if we neglect so great a bsalvation? That*salvation*, first cspoken by the Lord, was dconfirmed to us by those who heard, **4** God also testifying with them, both by asigns and wonders and by bvarious 1miracles and by 2cgifts of the Holy Spirit daccording to His own will.

### Jesus, the  Author of Salvation
**Heb. 2:5**   For He did not subject to angels 1athe world to come, concerning which we are speaking. **6** But one has testified asomewhere, saying, 
	“bWHAT IS MAN, THAT YOU REMEMBER HIM? 
	OR THE SON OF MAN, THAT YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HIM?
**7** 	“aYOU HAVE MADE 1HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS; 
	YOU HAVE CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND HONOR, 
	2AND HAVE APPOINTED HIM OVER THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;
**8** 	aYOU HAVE PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET.” 

 For in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. But now bwe do not yet see all things subjected to him. **9** But we do see Him who was amade 1for a little while lower than the angels—Jesus, bbecause of the suffering of death ccrowned with glory and honor, so that dby the grace of God He might etaste death ffor everyone.

**Heb. 2:10**   For ait was fitting for Him, bfor whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to cperfect the 1dauthor of their salvation through sufferings. **11** For both He who asanctifies and those who bare being sanctified are all cof One; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them dbrothers, **12** saying, 
	“aI WILL RECOUNT YOUR NAME TO MY BROTHERS, 
	IN THE MIDST OF THE ASSEMBLY I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE.”

**Heb. 2:13**   And again, 
	“aI WILL PUT MY TRUST IN HIM.” 

 And again, 
	“bBEHOLD, I AND THE CHILDREN WHOM GOD HAS GIVEN ME.”

**Heb. 2:14**   Therefore, since the children share in 1aflesh and blood, bHe Himself likewise also partook of the same, that cthrough death He might render powerless dhim who had the 2power of death, that is, the devil, **15** and might free those who through afear of death were subject to slavery all their lives. **16** For assuredly He does not 1give help to angels, but He gives help to the seed of Abraham. **17** Therefore, He 1had ato be made like His brothers in all things, so that He might bbecome a merciful and faithful chigh priest in dthings pertaining to God, to emake propitiation for the sins of the people. **18** For since He Himself was atempted in that which He has suffered, He is able to come to help those who are tempted.
