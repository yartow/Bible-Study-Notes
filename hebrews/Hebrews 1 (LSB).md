# Hebrews 1 (LSB)
### God’s Final Word in His Son
> **Heb. 1:1**   God, having aspoken long ago to the fathers in bthe prophets in many portions and cin many ways, **2** 1ain these last days bspoke to us 2in c*His* Son, whom He appointed dheir of all things, ethrough whom also He made the 3fworlds,  

Jesus is not only the Prophet through Whom God speaks to us, but also the **heir of all things** and the Creator of the world. He is even more than that, He is the sacrifice needed to atone for our sins, He is the temple where this sacrifice takes place and where the Holy Spirit lives. We often speak of the Trinity, three Persons with different roles, as described according to—among others—the Dutch Confession of Faith (Nederlandse Geloofsbelijdenis) but of course by other catechisms as well, but it seems like the second Person, the Son, has most of the work to do. This of course is only appearance, for each of the three Persons are working invisibly to us. The Holy Spirit is present in every hook and cranny speaking to billions of people, and having spoken many billions before us, convicting them of their sin, speaking to their conscience, empowering Christians to do God's work and fulfill His will, all the while with angels, strengthened by the power of the Holy Spirit roam and watch the Earth to report back to God. All of this is then coordinated by God the Father, planned ahead before the ages, Who knows every person by name and every person's heart and wicked scheme in it. The Father has an intricate plan by which He intends to bring that person back to Him, without forcing Him, but by allowing a series of coincidences to occur in this person's life.
All three Persons care for the soul of each man. Like a shepherd who loves all of his sheep, but unlike a shepherd who cannot take care of seven billion sheep, God is able to much more and cannot be fathomed or represented in similes or comparisons. He is infinitely more love and knowledge than all of humanity together has.

The author of Hebrews speaks of a plural **worlds** here, indicating—perhaps—the heavens (also plural) and the Earth, but not—probably—alien or parallel worlds. The visible world, which is only inhabited on this planet, is present alongside an invisible world, that is the spiritual world, where angels and demons are present, but perhaps there are even more worlds. The spiritual world could be like the material one, but with another dimension that allows spirits to go through matter, a little bit like that movie *Interstellar* #tags/movies with Matthew McConoughey #tags/famouspeople/actors #todo/opzoeken , but not through time. It is very likely that God Himself lives in a world with more dimensions than the spiritual one as He freely moves through space *and* time. Whether that world is *created* is open for a philosophical debate, but will never be answered until we ask God Himself and even then the question is whether we will be able to understand His answer. For it comes to the fact that God has always existed, but *in what space or void* did He exist and where did this *space or void* come from? 

It's surprising to see that the author of Hebrews writes that Jesus was **appointed heir of all things**, considering the fact that God the Father will never die. So what use is there then to provide an heir if he can never inherit those things? The heir in ancient times was a prince who co-ruled with his father, the king. Before the father died and perhaps, even from a very young age—because one never knows when one dies, especially in those days with wars and illnesses—the son had to be prepared for taking over the throne and the prince would actually be co-ruling already before officially taking over the throne. Co-ruling was even considered to be something official, as can be seen in the chronicles of certain ages areas. Even in Chronicles and Kings it says #todo/opzoeken/reference "after this or this king had ruled for so many years", but when one compares the two books with each other, one will see that the timelines are not exactly the same, for in Chronicles the reign includes the co-ruling period, while in Kings the official reign of a king started when the previous king had passed away and it was only then when the heir had inherited the throne.

> **3** who is the radiance of His glory and the exact arepresentation of His nature, and 1bupholds all things by the word of His power;   

Here we read about **the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature**. We do not read "the glory", but "the *radiance* of His glory"; We do not read "His nature" but "the exact *representation*" thereof. It might seem as if Jesus is depicted here as less than God because he is not the substance itself but merely the representation of something or the cast shadow of a substance, like the *shadow* of a king—and a shadow is always less than the substance itself.
Is it true then that Jesus is less than the Father? Of course not, He is God Himself and He is equal to the Father in stature and position, or whatever one calls it. They merely differ in function and in Person. Be careful not to say "in being" here, for as Nabeel Qureshi #tags/famouspeople/christian explained in a debate with Shabir Ally #tags/famouspeople/critics, they are One in being, but three in person. So when it says that He is the *radiance* of the Father's glory, this doesn't mean He is less.
In order to explain that Jesus is equal to the Father (Philippians 2:6) we first need to explain what **glory** means and then what the **radiance** thereof  is. 

Glory is not a thing that can be grabbed. I am not speaking about material vs. an immaterial matter, such as the flesh vs. the spirit. Though the spirit is immaterial, it is still an object, or subject, of discussion. But *glory* is better compared with something like *intellect*. It is not a "thing" nor is it—actually—something one *has*. A person may *have* a certain capacity of thinking, analyzing and memorizing, but that does *not* show his intellect. It is the *product* of this capacity that shows this, which is visible in his speech or any work of his, such as a book. 
In the same way glory itself is not visible but the product of it is. A soldier may be very capable, but his glory is only shown when he has defeated his enemy. As for the glory of God, this is shown in part by His works (cf. Romans 1:20 and Psalm #todo/opzoeken/reference  "the heavens and stars proclaim the glory of God"). People are amazed by it and fall completely silent when they see the beauty of the starry skies, a waterfall or something like the Grand Canyon. I myself was silent for 45 minutes, just staring the size and greatness of that. But all of this can be viewed by man, without problems. If God shows just a little more of His glory, he is thrown backwards (John 18:6), blinded (Acts 9:8), his face will be completely radiating ( #todo/opzoeken/reference Moses) until he becomes so fearful of God that he will prostrate himself and fear for his life, and lastly even die, where both body and soul are destroyed, if God were to fully show His glory. 
Now it would be very strange to say that something *is* the glory, for we cannot define nor grasp this glory. We can only say something of the Person who obtained this glory (i.e. Yahweh) and the product of this glory. We know the Son, Jesus Christ, is this Person, and He is not the *product* of this glory. This product would be, among others, His Creation and His work on the cross and His subsequent resurrection. Therefore, rather, the Son is described as the *radiance* of Yahweh's glory. It is that thing that is *between* the Person and the product. It is very difficult to comprehend, but it is like *truth*. What is truth? It is not the person who mentions a truthful statement, nor is it the words that he speaks. Rather the truthful statement infers and imbues truth. #todo/nogaftemaken 

[het stuk hieronder is oud]
 but rather, first of all, we need to consider the fact that Jesus *is not* the glory of His Father, for nothing can *be* the glory. The glory of God cannot be materialized like a car. With a car one can speak of the reflection of a car or the radiance of a car and that any car itself is always worth more than a picture of it. But one cannot say the same of glory because it cannot be said that something is better than this glory. So one can also not say that the radiance of the glory is worse than the glory itself, because glory does not exist in and of itself.
Glory is something that one gives to another and it cannot be materialized, as said before. Glory can only be seen *through* its radiance. 
**Example.** Just like the sun in and of itself is nothing. It doesn't give heat. It is just a ball made up of atoms—hydrogen, helium, neon and other atoms—where nuclear fission and fusion are used to create heat and light. One could say that the radiance of the sun actually is what is important, for it is the radiance of the sun that gives us light and warmth. It gives us all kinds of other things, such as solar flares. It is not completely proven yet but during these solar flares there is a boost in electromagnetic waves #todo/opzoeken which cast off and protect us from large amounts of cosmic background radiation, which is harmful for us and nature. 

> John 1:14 And athe Word bbecame flesh, and 1cdwelt among us, and dwe beheld His glory, glory as of the 2only begotten from the Father, full of egrace and ftruth.  
> -> the glory of Jesus, the Son, is the same as that of the Father  
-> Jesus is also the *radiance* of God's glory. 


Another example is that the radiance of glory is not the same as the product of one's glory. For example, an artist such as Rembrandt or Van Gogh has disputably beautiful paintings and the glory of the artist can be seen through these paintings. The glory would be even experienced more, or would be more visible, when one could see the painter himself. Perhaps Van Gogh is not the right example, for he was a depressed person and I don't know the character of Rembrandt, but these artists are not necessarily more interesting than their works. However, my point is that there is something bigger than the picture of a painting, and there is something bigger than the painting itself. Maybe one could say that watching the painting is not enough. Touching the painting, watching it up-close, spending more time on the painting while observing or analyzing it—all of that is worth more than just a quick glance at it, like one does in a museum like the Louvre, where one hardly has enough time to study the plethora of works of art. And all of these things one is not allowed to do in a museum.

#todo/nogaftemaken 
Now in the same way we can say that the glory of God is visible through his creation, we can see nature and if you know nature more you can see DNA and no how nature is made up of cells that atoms and all kinds of internal biological constructions, which are fascinating.

But nothing is as fascinating as seeing the glory of God himself. Which we cannot see Moses has seen it, but even he saw it in a form of a vision because he saw God, but no one can see God without dying. And we know that most lift and ever seeing God.

So he saw something like God but in any case, he saw more of the glory than we ever did see. And that radiance. That we can see not the product of the glory, not the creation itself, but the radiance Like that mode like that which most saw that is Jesus Christ.

Jesus Christ, is the radiance of God. And of course, still mostly not see the full radiance and the full glory, but This is. Where Jesus is? It is no less than the glory itself. It is just One could say the substance of the glory that is visible to others.

Now, to the second point. It says **the exact representation of His nature**. Unfortunately the ESV has translated the word *representation* with *imprint*. An imprint, no matter how exact, stays an imprint, which is a mirrored version of the original. This is not so with a representative, an one hundred percent exact representative would be equal to the original, but there are no *exact* representatives.
So we ask ourselves the question: What is better, the nature of the Father or a representation thereof? Everyone agrees that the representation of the king is worth less than hearing the king himself. No one wants to rather have letters written by a representative of the king than letters coming from the king himself. First of all, the former letters do not contain the exact words, because a representative of the king will never exactly write down what the king has said. But even if the kings mentions each word and literal punctuation to his representative, and even the right intonation, this will never be exactly the same as a recording of the king's speech. Even more so, a recording of the king would never be the same as hearing the king speaking live. 


All we have Are. Speeches. Of recorded speeches of Martin Luther King Jr. And he spoke his famous speech. In Washington DC at the capital, whatever that place is called with that water. I have a dream speech. But those who are present there, those can really testify The feeling they had hearing him were also all others around him shouting for joy.

Maybe even chanting The same is for people who've gone to Woodstock even though that is of a whole other caliber and that's holy more profane. But in any case, The representation of something is not the same as the exact thing there is, but the exact representation of the father.

Is as it says, exact and not as, we mean an exact copy or something because then you still have to work copy or worldly term, exact, because nothing is exactly exact a copy is consist of other atoms it Could be the same batch of ink but it's another piece of paper and it's a copy of a letter.

It's other ink. They're really And now we're talking about spiritual things, not material things. In material things, you can never have anything. That is exactly, like another thing. But in spiritual things you can have For this one is experienced God. And at the same time, at the other end of the side of the world, another person experience, God, did they have the same experience of God?

If it's the same, Holy Spirit, if it's the same God, then they had the same experience, of course, leaving the emotional and the personal part aside. Because but I mean like, Something it is the same food. They ate literally, but But now I'm talking about this the same God, they saw And it is possible because God is not made of matter, but he is experienced.

Any. Representation of God's nature. Worth only an infinite testimony fracture less. Then, the father's nature himself, would not have been able to create. Anything is infinite as the universe and the verse before, it says that it is Jesus created the universe. In its perfect way. And it was good as God has said in Genesis 1.

So we know that Jesus is nothing less than an exact representation of God.

### The upholding of the universe 
Many do not understand what it means that Jesus **upholds all things by the word of His power**. Let us start explaining the *upholding* of things first and its implications on our lives. 
Everything is made up of atoms and every body is made up of cells, which consist of atoms. What is the difference in cells or atoms between a person who dies of old age and this same person but one second before he dies? Nothing. In the TV series #tags/movies *Breaking Bad* the protagonist is a chemist who once calculated what matter people consisted of. Summing up every known matter, such as carbon and nitrogen, still 0.2% remained, which could not be explained, and he wondered whether that was the human soul. Of course this is only fiction and neither the soul nor the spirit are contained in material form or take up any weight or volume, but there is indeed something that explains the difference between a dead and a living person. 
In its core a cell is merely a bag of fat, lipids, containing many molecules that float around. They are not *doing* anything, as if they are robots, but one way or the other, through chemical reactions and even *mechanical* workings—which we are not certain of how exactly these take place—cells and the molecules provide to each other what they need to stay *alive*. One could compare the body with a country, and every cell with a city, and the roads to each city with our vessels. If one city provides food and the other power, but the road between them is blocked, then both cities will perish. In the same way if one type of cell, blood cells, transport oxygen to our organs, and another energy, for example in the form of glucose, but the heart stops pumping, then the resources these cells and organs need will die. 
However, if we take the example of a car engine, which also needs oxygen (through air) and power (through fuel) to run, if these resources are not delivered, though the engine will die, it can easily be restarted. All it needs are those two resources and a kickstart and it will run by itself. The turning of a cylinder (piston) will turn something (such as the axis which will turn the wheels) and at the same time provide the power to suck new air and fuel to run another cycle. But with the human body—which is in fact only a bunch of cells—after it is deprived of oxygen for only ten minutes, it dies. One can then provide a surplus of oxygen to the deceased person and give as many kickstarts it wants through defibrillation, or even replace the heart, but he will not come back to life again. Now the human body is much more complex than a car engine and it has all kinds of controls through the brain and the peripheral nerve system, which uses electricity to control the nerves and hormones for slower working processes, but still, with all of man's present knowledge he is still not able to resuscitate a deceased person after a mere few minutes—and I dare to say that this will even apply in the future. 
The reason for this is that this does not depend on man's knowledge, but on the power of God *upholding* everything. Just like the Earth is far enough from the Sun not to get burned only because it is in perpetual motion, but will immediately be pulled towards the Sun by its gravity, in the same way every atom also consists of a nucleus and a satellite orbiting around it while at the same time both are attracting each other. As soon as God's Word does not empower every atom through quantum powers every atom, and in turn every molecule, cell and body collapses. 

Now what does it mean when it says that the universe is upheld by the **word of His power**? Note that it does not say *the power of His Word*. Does this mean that His power has words? In the most literal sense *power* could be a personification, just like *Wisdom* is personified in Proverbs 2. Now this personified *power* may be a figurative person who speaks words that uphold the universe. Such power does the Lord have that not only His, but even His servants' words have strength to uphold the universe. 
However, I do not think that this interpretation is meant here. Perhaps this should be read as *words of power* meaning that these words contain His power, which is more logical. 

### Verse 3b
> who, having accomplished ccleansing for sins, dsat down at the right hand of the eMajesty on high,  

These two verses must strike the Muslim apologist hard, because it is saying that Jesus sits **at the right hand** of God and that Jesus is **better than the angels**. Their prophet Muhammad is neither of those. There can only be one sitting at the right hand of God, and perhaps one at His left hand, but most honor goes to the former and that is not Muhammad. According to Islamic #tags/religion/islam teaching Muhammad is the last and the best prophet, no one will come after him, even though the Qur'an does teach that Jesus will return to Earth, just as described in Revelation ( #todo/opzoeken which differences does the Qur'an have with the Bible concerning that topic?), but Jesus' *first* coming was before that of Muhammad and there will be no new prophet after him. But if Muhammad is the best prophet but not higher than the angels, how can Jesus Who commands all the angels be less than Muhammad? Muhammad was afraid of the angel Jibriel—who is according to Muslims the same as Gabriel—and choked by him, but Jesus said He could ask His Father and He would send *more than* twelve legions of angels (Matthew 26:53). This is but one example, for in the rest of the Bible we find numerous examples of angels worshiping Jesus. 

### The accomplishment of cleansing for sins
What does it mean to have **accomplished cleansing for sins**? The ESV has *make purification for sins* here, but the LSB emphasizes in a sense that it is not simply *making* this, but that it needs to be *accomplished*. It was not a simple job to achieve this. 
The verse also seems to indicate that Jesus **sat down at the right hand** of God only *after* having accomplished this. This would contradict the doctrine that Jesus is God and always has been, for how could Jesus have had a period in time where He was *not* the Son—or did not have the right to the throne—but only *became* the Son after His achievements? Partially, it is for symbolic or poetic reasons when this is described in this way. David for example writes in Psalm 110:1 that Yahweh tells Jesus to sit at His right hand. Telling one to sit means that one is *not* sitting right now, otherwise it does not make sense and if we interpret this literally, this would mean that before Yahweh said this, Jesus was not at God's right hand. However, the psalmist is emphasizing the *relationship* between a king and his heir, and not the *current position* of the Son to the Father. It is like when a man tells his wife "You look so beautiful today," upon which the wife will not ask "So I did not look beautiful yesterday?" In the same way David is not describing when or whether this happened in the past or that this will happen in the future, but merely that Jesus has His place at the right hand of Yahweh. 
If there is any description of time it is in v.4 of this psalm where Yahweh swears that Jesus is "a priest *forever*" (emphasis added), and forever is an infinite amount of time both forward as well as backwards in time. (Note it does not say that Jesus will be a priest from now on until eternity.)

Still, the question remains whether Jesus sat down before His accomplishment of purification for sins or that He that position before His accomplishment. The answer lies in the fact that there had never been a time *before* His accomplishment. Even though Jesus birth, death and resurrection and the atonement that came along with it happened at a certain moment in *human* history, from God's point of view this happened even before the foundation of the world existed (cf. John 17:5) when Jesus *already* possessed His glory. We would say that Jesus had this glory *before* His achievements, but we need to realize that God lives outside of the dimensions of space and time and the achievements of His Son had been done all along. This means that when God spoke to the prophets, such as Ezekiel, Isaiah and Hosea, about His bride whom He would save and redeem, this had already happened and God was not looking forward to the event of His Son dying on the cross and the return of His bride, but rather describing these. 

#todo/nogaftemaken 



> **4** having become so much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent aname than they.  

#todo/nogaftemaken 
In Hebrews chapter 1, verse 4 read few things. And If you close from the old testament, These are extremely hard for Muslims to deny. Remember that most still have that first neck run that if anyone Has any problems with? In the Quran, he should go back to New Testament and the Old Testament, see what is written there.

And well they think the Bible does not officially say that Jesus is a God. Well, let's just see that just for the sake of our argument. It does say that Jesus is the son of God. Well what? Cuz that'd be, it could be an angel could be a leader of all the angels.

It could be a great king but in any case he is called the son And perhaps she's an angel as well. Well, I'm the don't have to rock. Don't of wish many people think it is a mosque in Jerusalem, which it is not.

It's written on the sides. That there is only one God Allah. And his name is Valau or something. Important is profit is more of it And God has no son. Something like that, sending it that up. But we know that. They cannot. Say that, that is true. And say that the Quran is true at the same time, so they are contradicting themselves.

If one uses only the Quran, Even then. They will contradict themselves.

Because the Quran says that, Rogers created by the word even leaving John aside, which says that the word is God. Was created by the word. And it says that Jesus is the word. It says. Through his word. Heading up all these sentences. Statements, this means that. Jesus is the word and he is gone because it is the word that created.

And by the way, this is an appropriate reflection of how the Old Testament and the New Testament work together. So if Muhammad says that we should go back to the Old Testament *and* the New Testament, one needs only to go back to this verse and will see the New Testament *citing from* the Old Testament that Jesus is God's Son. #tags/religion/islam


> **Heb. 1:5**   For to which of the angels did He ever say,   
> 	“aYOU ARE MY SON,   
> 	TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU”?   
>   
>  And again,   
> 	“bI WILL BE A FATHER TO HIM   
> 	AND HE SHALL BE A SON TO ME”?  

It might seem as if this verse is taken slightly out of context, for the Lord Yahweh was saying this to David, and the Lord was indeed like a father to David, as it says in the second part of 2 Samuel 7:14, that He would reprove him when he commits iniquity, but the relationship between the first and second persons of the Trinity, i.e. the Father and the Son, I had always seen as being #todo/opzoeken/engels controlling and operating, respectively. There would have been no place for reproving, for the Son never commits any sin. 
Again, I think we are putting an emphasis on the wrong thing if we look at this verse as *explanatory* of the relationship between the Father and the Son. The relation between the three Persons of the Trinity cannot be explained in any way with human words, nor by analogies—not by water, ice and gas, nor by an egg, its yolk and its shell nor by body, soul and mind. Perhaps it is for this reason the author of Hebrews did not cite the second part of the verse. These citations have as purpose to show that the relationship between the Father and Jesus is not like that between the Father and the angels. By far, for no angel has personally been called "My son"—although angels are referred to in a more impersonal way "sons of God" nor is there any description in the Bible of God's (any Person of the Trinity) love for an angel (as far as I know #todo/opzoeken ). 

### The status of the Son vs. angels — Being worshipped vs. worshipping
The previous two verses were about the difference between the relation between the Father and the Son, and between the Father and the angels. This part is about the differences between the status of Jesus. Jesus is God, which is inferred by the fact that God says that **all the angels of God [should] worship Him** (quoted from Psalm 97:7). We know that there is only One Who may be worshipped and that is God. So if God tells or allows anyone to worship any other person, then that Person is God as well. 

> **Heb. 1:6**   And 1when He again abrings the firstborn into 2bthe world, He says,   
> 	“cAND LET ALL THE ANGELS OF GOD WORSHIP HIM.”  

### The preservation of the Son vs. angels — eternal vs. temporal

> **Heb. 1:7**   And of the angels He says,   
> 	“aWHO MAKES HIS ANGELS WINDS,   
> 	AND HIS MINISTERS FLAMING FIRE.”  

The word *preservation* might be wrong here, but the point is that the Son is more than the angels. Though the angels may be like **winds**—which can go wherever they want and "never" be destroyed or even withheld by any force—and like **flaming fire**—which can destroy everything they come across—both are not eternal. Fire needs fuel and wind needs pressure. But Jesus—and His throne—**is forever and ever** and we know that the only thing that has always been, since eternity, is God. #todo/opzoeken I was there before the times began, ancient of days.

> **Heb. 1:8**   But of the Son*He says*,   
> 	“aYOUR THRONE, O GOD, IS FOREVER AND EVER,   
> 	AND THE SCEPTER OF UPRIGHTNESS IS THE SCEPTER OF 1YOUR KINGDOM.  
> **9** 	“aYOU HAVE LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATED LAWLESSNESS;   
> 	bTHEREFORE GOD, YOUR GOD, HAS cANOINTED YOU   
> 	WITH THE OIL OF GLADNESS ABOVE YOUR COMPANIONS.”  

Here is another depiction (by an unknown psalmist) of Jesus being God, for the psalmist calls Him this in v.8, and showing in v.9 that God (in the form of Jesus) has a God as well, Which is His Father. 
We know that v.8 is not wrongly cited merely to strengthen the argument of typology, for in Psalm 97, where this part is quoted from, we see in v.7 that "God, Your God, has anointed [the Son]". We also see another example of these psalms being used to emphasize certain aspects. In Psalm 97:9 for example we see that the Son will have the King's daughters as noble ladies, but of course we know that Jesus is far above marrying His own (sinful) creation, let alone many of them. It merely depicts the powerful king He is, for powerful kings in those days had many wives. It would be like comparing Jesus' wealth with the many cars and houses a rich person has. All of these mean nothing to Jesus, for He needs no place to live in or a means to be transported by. 

> **Heb. 1:10**   And,   
> 	“aYOU, LORD, IN THE BEGINNING FOUNDED THE EARTH,   
> 	AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;  
> **11** 	aTHEY WILL PERISH, BUT YOU REMAIN;   
> 	bAND THEY ALL WILL WEAR OUT LIKE A GARMENT,  
> **12** 	aAND LIKE A MANTLE YOU WILL ROLL THEM UP;   
> 	LIKE A GARMENT THEY WILL ALSO BE CHANGED.   
> 	BUT YOU ARE bTHE SAME,   
> 	AND YOUR YEARS WILL NOT COME TO AN END.”  

This part emphasizes the eternity of Jesus (and God). All things—which He created—will **wear out** and **be changed** but Jesus will remain forever. The Bible also says #todo/opzoeken/reference the everything comes to pass, the Word of the Lord remains forever. 

### The function of the Son — ruler
> **Heb. 1:13**   But to which of the angels has He ever said,   
> 	“aSIT AT MY RIGHT HAND,   
> 	bUNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES   
> 	AS A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET”?  
>   
> **Heb. 1:14**   Are they not all aministering spirits, sent to render service for the sake of those who will binherit csalvation?  

Angels are literally messengers, translated as angeloos  (Gr. #todo/opzoeken/greek) and here described as **ministering spirits**. It becomes clear here that Jesus is not an angel and much more than than an angel, for an angel is merely ministering God, while Jesus sits **at the right hand** of God and *rules* over His **enemies**. Furthermore, Jesus *created* **the Earth, and the heavens**, while no angel has ever created *anything*. Jesus will also *destroy* things and **roll [...] up** the universe **like a mantle**, but not angel has ever destroyed anything. Even the fire raining down from heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah was not caused by an angel. Yes, the Satan, an angel, did destroy Job's barn and the lives of many, but he did not disintegrate what he destroyed. He merely increased the entropy. 

This conclusion concerning Jesus' position is a sting in the eyes of the Jehova's Witnesses #tags/religion/jehovaswitnesses, for they claim that Jesus is merely an angel, albeit the leader of all other angels, but that would contradict all of the other statements concerning Him above.
