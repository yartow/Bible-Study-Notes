# Genesis 18
*Genesis 18:6 (ESV) 6 And Abraham went quickly into the tent to Sarah and said, â€œQuick! Three seahs of fine flour! Knead it, and make cakes.*

This is more than they could ever eat, about 21 liters of flour. It is custom to provide more to guests than they can eat, but this was too abundant. Perhaps he wanted to give them stuff along as well. This, however,  would contradict the theory that Abraham knew that among these three men God was present.
