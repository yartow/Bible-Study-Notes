# Romans 4 (ESV)
**Abraham Justified by Faith**
*What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? 2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. 3 For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.”*

Genesis 15:1-6 said that Abraham believed in Yahweh.  

*4 Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. 5 And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,* 

This is very difficult to explain. *If* Abraham was justified by works, and yes, he must have done a lot of good things—he listened to God and he took the step to go to the promised land—so he could boast before us, but he could not boast before God, for several reasons. First of all, it is never possible to boast before God because He is always immeasurably better than we are. Second of all, God *credited* salvation to him as righteousness. Verses 4 and 5 then explain how we can tell from this line whether Abraham worked or whether he believed. It explains that in the former case it is the worker's due and in the second case it is righteousness that is given to a person. 

*6 just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:*
*7 “Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven,*
*and whose sins are covered;*
*8 blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.”*

Paul then goes on to say that those who *receive* this righteousness *apart from works* but by faith—that is, the people who did not earn their righteousness by works but by faith (of which there are none by the way)—are blessed because they are forgiven for their sins.  Or put in other words, the one who *receives* righteousness is blessed because his sins are forgiven. What do we say then of the man who worked for his salvation? He does not need forgiveness because he has no sin, so he does not need to receive this blessing and thus this blessing would not apply on him. 

*9 Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. 10 How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. 11 He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, 12 and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.*

The text here explains clearly whether this blessing is for the Jews or also for the rest of the world. I could not explain it any better. God's purpose is clear. He has always wanted the whole world to be saved and this message had to be started through one man, Abraham. 
Paul clearly explains that if Abraham received righteousness before his circumcision then he would be the father of both the circumcised and the uncircumcised. The uncircumcised would then know that even an uncircumcised person is able to receive righteousness and the circumcised person would know that righteousness is given to those who are like the first circumcised person, i.e. Abraham, who walked by faith. 

**The Promise Realized Through Faith**
*13 For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. 14 For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. 15 For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.*

God made Abraham a promise to become heir of the world. Theoretically there could have been two ways in which God could have made Abraham heir, through the law or through righteousness of faith. If it were the former, then it would not really have been a promise from God, for Abraham would have worked for it himself. It would be a void promise, like a parent promising his child: "I promise you, you will pass your exams." Unless the parent does all he can to bribe the examinators and knows it will succeed in it, there is no promise in here. First of all, it is not a promise because passing the exams is not something the parent can do. A promise is only valid when someone actually *does* something. Second of all, if there is no certainty it cannot be called a promise—at least not one from God. 
So we conclude that it must be the latter. *God* works and makes sure Abraham receives what God promised him. 
We could have gotten to this conclusion through another way and that is that Abraham could never live a life without sin, even if one were only to count the life after God's promise. #church/material

*16 That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,*

There is also a *reason* why God wanted this promise to come through righteousness of faith, and that is because that is the only way God can guarantee all of Abraham's offspring. Abraham living a tenaciously sinless life does not guarantee that his son would do the same. As a matter of fact, Isaac was a little worse and both of his sons were far worse in being upright—Jacob was changed by God, not by Isaac's teaching. 

*17 as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”—in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. 18 In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, “So shall your offspring be.” 19 He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb.*

Abraham kept his faith and he is credited a lot of honor for this by the Jews, who see him as their father, because he had faith in having another child even though he was a hundred years old and his wife was 90. So tremendous was his faith, because nothing like this had happened before, as far as I think the Jews knew about. All other examples of barren women, like Rachel, Hannah and Elizabeth would come hundreds or thousands of years later. Those women could have faith like Abraham did on behalf of Sarah, who at first did not believe (but probably did afterwards, after finding out that these men were angels). 
For this perhaps just as much faith is needed as believing that God can raise someone from the dead. In fact that is what God has done and I think that somewhere the Bible explains this as well. Elizabeth's womb as good as dead, Abraham's body as well. Now if God can do those things, He can resurrect people as well. 

*20 No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, 21 fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.* 

What is especially remarkable is that Abraham did not have any unbelief. Even though he had a child with Hagar, I think that could either be credited to Sarah's unbelief and Abraham's obedience to her, or Abraham's wrong thinking in that that child would be God's, but never had it been the case that Abraham doubted God's ability to bring forth a child from Sarah's womb. 

*22 That is why his faith was “counted to him as righteousness.” 23 But the words “it was counted to him” were not written for his sake alone, 24 but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, 25 who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.*

#biblestudy/questions wat wordt er bedoeld met vers 22 waarin staat dat het geloof aan Abraham wordt toegerekend uit rechtvaardigheid? Heeft Abraham iets gedaan waardoor hij zo'n sterk geloof gekregen heeft? 

These words were written so that we may know that what happened to Abraham is available to us as well. First of all for the Jews, because they read it first and because they have received the promise, but second of all for us as well, because this promise is dependent on faith and to anyone who has faith.
