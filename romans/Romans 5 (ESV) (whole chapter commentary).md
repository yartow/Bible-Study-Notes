## Overview of Romans 5
This chapter is traditionally divided into two pericopes, e.g. according to the *ESV*
1. Peace with God through faith 
2. Death in Adam, Life in Christ

Depending on where the actual start and end is of this part, which is before and after Chapter 5—it can clearly be seen from the rhetoric that Paul uses that even in Chapter 7 the rhetoric continues—and which surpasses the traditional or "canonical" pericopes, I would rename and reorder this into 
1. The three rejoices (vv.1-11)
2. The grace of God abounds for the condemnation of Adam (vv.12-21)

The second pericope in vv.12-21 explains how death entered into this world and how Jesus' sacrifice brought eternal life for us and will also be explained [below](bear://x-callback-url/open-note?id=95964C3A-5133-47A9-A7B5-FACD598A7A09-1828-00022431033D8947&header=How%20death%20entered%20into%20this%20world). 

## The three rejoices
There are three things Paul rejoices in, or that Christians should rejoice in: 
1. Rejoice in hope of the glory of God (v.2)
2. Rejoice in our sufferings (v.3)
	1. Elaboration on hope (vv.6-8)
	2. Argumentation for the certainty of our salvation (vv.9-10)
3. Rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ (v.11)

The first rejoice is shortly explained by the fact that we now have peace with God and access into His grace. This is not commentaried #todo/opzoeken/engels gecommentarieerd, because this seems to be trivial. The second rejoice is elaborated more expansively in vv.3-10 and its commentary on [hope](bear://x-callback-url/open-note?id=95964C3A-5133-47A9-A7B5-FACD598A7A09-1828-00022431033D8947&header=Elaboration%20on%20hope) and [salvation](bear://x-callback-url/open-note?id=95964C3A-5133-47A9-A7B5-FACD598A7A09-1828-00022431033D8947&header=Argumentation%20for%20the%20certainty%20of%20our%20salvation) can be found below. This section is then concluded with commentary on [the third rejoice](bear://x-callback-url/open-note?id=95964C3A-5133-47A9-A7B5-FACD598A7A09-1828-00022431033D8947&header=The%20third%20rejoice%20%E2%80%94%20Rejoice%20in%20God%20through%20our%20Lord%20Jesus%20Christ%20%28v.11%29).

## The second rejoice — Rejoicing in our sufferings (v.3-10)
### Elaboration on hope

> *Romans 5:3-5 (ESV) 3 Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, 4 and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, 5 and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.*  

Paul describes a string of consequences starting with our sufferings as Christians. I am explicitly saying *our* instead of *their* because I think Paul meant not only that this happens but also that it *should* happen in every Christian's life.
The first part of this string is quite clear and does not need any extra explanation, but the relationship between character and hope might raise some questions. How does character lead to hope? We see mature people with good characters as those who are more relaxed, with more peace in their hearts. Most often they have some form of wisdom. *Sherlock Holmes* #tags/movies#, for example in the version played by Benedict Cumberbatch #tags/famouspeople/actors, seems to show this relaxedness though not due to hope, but due to his intelligence. This is *not* the form of relaxedness we hope for, as we know that Sherlock Holmes—at least in this version—is not known for his character. No, it is rather a *James Bond*-like character in movies that expresses this ease of mind and hope he has in a better outcome. In other words, hope, which is related to peace, is obtained through character and the experience of perseverence and suffering. 

The follow-up question is how hope does not put us to shame. My explanation here [[Romans 5 (ESV)]] explains this from verse 5 only, which in hindsight seems to be not comprehensive enough. The answer is actually found in vv.6-8 and is linked by the word "for."

> *Romans 5:6-8 (ESV) 6 For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. 7 For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die— 8 but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.*  

What this part says in the context of v.5 is that *because* Christ died for us even while we were sinners, weak and ungodly—so not righteous or let alone good—this makes us realize that God loves us so much (which is described by "the pouring of love from God") and this gives us hope. This hope is not realized through an understanding other than through the understanding that the Holy Spirit gives us. 

### Argumentation for the certainty of our salvation
> *Romans 5:9-10 (ESV) 9 Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. 10 For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.*  

Now that we have hope that God loves us so much as is willing to do so much more, Paul adds to this an additional reasoning by deduction—perhaps for the ones who still doubt, or simply to give more confirmation. He argues that if we are reconciled with God, this of course means that are saved. It is like two tribes having an argument and someone from the second tribe sinned against the first tribe and must now be executed. Instead, *someone* offers to take the place of that person (which in the case of Christianity would be the son of the chief of the first tribe). Now, if the first chief were an honorable man he would not, after this person has sacrificed his life, still execute the #todo/opzoeken/engels schuldige. 
In the same way, Jesus has died for us and this brought reconciliation with God and ultimately salvation. 
The same thing is written in v.9 which means that because of His sacrifice (i.e. His blood) we are saved from the wrath of God.  

## The third rejoice — Rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ (v.11)
The third rejoice seems similar to the first one but there is a difference. Most likely the author means the following: *Rejoicing in ~hope~ of the glory of God* means that Paul was rejoicing in the waiting for the full glory of God to arrive on Earth, or that he would be able to do something great to magnify God's glory or any other way in which he would be able to see God's glory. In all cases it is the waiting he rejoices in as hope always implies a waiting time because hope merely means it is not there yet. 
Sometimes the hope is even better than the arrival itself. Many can imagine having ordered a wanted item and during the delivery time one can already sense one's happiness even though the item is not in one's hand yet or perhaps one has never even seen one in real life because it does not exist yet, such as many of the crowdfunded products on KickStarter. Perhaps therefore Paul ends this pericope with the explicit words *more than that* meaning that he rejoices in the so-called *product*, which is the arrival of or the meeting with Jesus Christ, more than in the hope in Him. #church/material/sermon
Now the hope has a component of suffering as well. Let us say a man is awaiting for his bride to arrive and he has sent her a letter to say that a carriage (or an airplane, if you will) will pick her up. On the one hand he is excited, but on the other hand he is suffering from the time that he is missing her. In the same way (one could say) we are excited about Jesus' coming but also suffering due to the fact we do not have Him near us. This, however, is not completely correct analogy for we have the Holy Spirit in us Who teaches us about Jesus and through Whom we can speak with Him, but also the Spirit comforts our every anguish and discomfort. 
The real suffering here is the persecution of Christians and the loneliness and the exclusion one experiences in this world of strangers, since we do not belong to this world anymore (#todo/opzoeken ).

## The grace of God abounds for the condemnation of Adam

## How death entered into this world

**Romans 5:12-21 (ESV)** 
* 12 Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned— 
	* 13 for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. 
		* 14 Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.
			* 15 But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many. 
			* 16 And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. 
				* For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification. 
				* 17 For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.
			* 18 Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. 
			* 19 For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous. 
* 20 Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, 21 so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

This part could be bit more difficult to read because it keeps making sideways, without clearly indicating where one argument or sidenote starts or ends. All of these are left to the reader, but I will do my best to present them as I interpret them. 
First of all, the first verse, v.12, does not even seem to have and ending. But let us continue reading and we will see where we end up. 

The therefore is pointing to?
