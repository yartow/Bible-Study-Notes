# Philippians 2 (ESV)

*19 I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you.*

Why would Paul send Timothy to them, so that Paul may be cheered by news of them? The only way I can think of is that Timothy would return and bring the news to Paul. But Paul says in the verses below that he hopes—and trusts—to go to the Philippians himself *shortly*. Also, why has Paul not requested—through a letter for example—to let someone send news over from the Philippians to report to him? Does this have anything to do with their reliability? Did Paul want to know the complete truth and was Timothy one of the few whom he trusted to report the truth to him?  No, the answer can be found in the next verse. 

*20 For I have no one like him, who will be ~genuinely~ concerned for your welfare.*

Paul wants to be cheered and he will be cheered when Timothy arrives in the Philippians. Why? Because then there will finally be someone who is genuinely concerned for the Philippians' welfare. Then the Philippians will have someone to care for them, to teach them what is right and Jesus Christ wants. Furthermore, they will see a great example of how a Christian should behave.

*21 For they ~all seek their own interests~, not those of Jesus Christ.*

There were many false teachers in those days. I do not know whether this was the case in the church of Philippi. #todo/opzoeken Paul knew, however, that those false teachers spread false teachings about circumcision, baptism and salvation—all of these false teachings were not only wrong doctrine, but they stirred up the people to fight against each other. 
That is the biggest problem of churches back then and now, that there is an internal battle. Even around the time of the creating of the Constitution of the United States, there was a letter by #todo/opzoeken Benjamin Franklin or Lincoln? 
which said that America would never fall, but if it does, it would be by the enemy within. 

*22 But you know Timothy's proven worth, how ~as a son with a father~ he has served with me in the gospel. 23 I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me, 24 and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also.*

So it is difficult to send help to a church or to a group or a community when you do not have those people whom you trust with all your heart. And even if you have those people, you do not want to lose them. You want them to assist *you*, or you want to train them more. 
That is why Paul is also waiting to send him out. I do not know if Paul needed physical assistance #todo/opzoeken as could be interpreted from the words "how it will go with me", but apparently there was something that withheld him from going just yet.

*25 I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow ~soldier~, and your ~messenger~ (voorbeeld tatoeage op hoofd) and minister to my need,*

It is necessary to send someone in the mean time. 

*26 for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill.* 

The real mark of Christian brotherhood is mutual distress, shown out of genuine car. The Philippians heard he was ill, and he heard that the Philippians heard and and became distressed because he did not want the Philippians to be distressed. If the Philippians were not distressed, however, they would not show real affection for him. 
~~Now I do not know the relationship between the Philippians and Epaphroditus, but it may not have been as close as we have relationships these days. There was fellowship when they met, but afterwards it was only contact through relayed messages, orally or textually. Since letters and visits were rare I would not expect close contact or further building up of a relationship.~~ 
~~On the other hand, given the fact that everything was so far away in that time, I can imagine every gift and message was even more intense.~~

I once had the chance to show my distress for another Christian. My mother was in a coma due to an aortic aneurysm, near the epicardium or pericardium #todo/opzoeken and lost a lot of blood. There was not much chance she would survive if she did not receive an operation soon. 
My father told us to say to her a few words before she went to surgery. Now I had all kinds of reasons to reject that. My main reason was that I did not believe she could hear me anyway, my second reason was out of principle, as can be seen in movies, where a person refuses to say goodbye because he he has faith that he will see him back again. 
Now I did have faith, in God, that He will make all things work together for good, and I did have peace, but I had no idea whether she would make it alive out of surgery and whether she would fully recover or not, but I had peace with any decision God had made. However, my reason for not saying anything was to imitate those movie scenes #tags/movies — which my father not only did not understand but did not appreciate either. 
To him, it was a gesture of coldness of heart and distance. He is, then again, from another culture where people even burn incense for the dead and of forefather worship. If I had known all of this, I would have explained to him my reasons for doing so before we went to the hospital. 
On the other hand, #todo nog af te maken

Allerlei labels op mezelf geplakt om achter te kunnen schuilen, begrip te creëren bij anderen, maar ook om op die manier een oplossing te kunnen vinden. Maar ik had geen van die diagnoses. Weet je wat ik wel had? Een zondig hart en slechte gewoontes. Dat is het. Gewoon heel simpel. 
Je kunt het narcistisch noemen, maar ik was egoïstisch. Als er taart is, eet ik die het liefst in mijn eentje op. Als we naar de film gaan, wil ik de film uitkiezen. 

*27 Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have ~sorrow upon sorrow~.*

Now we have to know that all things in this world ale interconnected. Paul here speaks of a mercy that God had on Epaphroditus, but through this mercy God had mercy on Paul as well. You can imagine that if your loved one does not die, he is relieved, but so are his loved ones. 
The same thing goes for sin. If you sin against someone, you will first of all sin against God and then sin against another person. This sin, however, will have its consequences on other people. Consider someone who has been bullied, how does he respond to others? How will his future character hurt or influence others to sin? It is an endless chain of sin we set in motion each time we sin. 
If God had let Epaphroditus die, Paul would have had sorrow his death, but also sorrow because the Philippians would have been mourning. The mourning of one can cause another to mourn as well. This is what Paul meant by sorrow upon sorrow. 

*28 I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious. 29 So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and ~honor such men, 30 for he nearly died for the work of Christ~, risking his life to complete what was ~lacking in your service~ to me.*

It is exactly because the Philippians were so distressed about Epaphroditus, that Paul assumes they we will rejoice when seeing him, which makes Paul even more eager to send him. He commends Epaphroditus as well for the work he has done. 
Never does Paul commend himself, but often he commends others, which also is a trait of a true Christian: humility and the lifting up of others. 
His last remark, however, seems to be stating that the Philippians did something wrong. From what I can infer from verses like 1 Corinthians 16:17 and Philippians 4:10 it seems that Paul is referring to the absence of the Philippians during his imprisonment. In those verses, however, it is clear that Paul understands and that Epaphroditus is a compensation for that. However, this particular verse, verse 30, feels different because there is no explanation after such a direct statement, which I would not expect—even from Paul—when a church has already sent their messenger and a monetary gift, without an explanation.
