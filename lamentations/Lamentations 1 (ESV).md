# Lamentations 1 (ESV) 
***How Lonely Sits the City***
*1 How lonely sits the city*
*that was full of people!*
*How like a widow has she become,*
*she who was great among the nations!*
*She who was a princess among the provinces*
*has become a slave.*

Jeremiah uses the extremest of all depictions to show the sadness which the city of Jerusalem would have felt in his or rather God's anthropomorphized description of Jerusalem as God's daughter. It is as if she has lost a husband, it is as if she has lost her children, it is like the fall from royalty to slave. Perhaps a princess could even be deemed higher than royalty in this specific example, for the queen and the king had great responsibilities, cares and worries, but the princess could be careless and worries and yet have anything she wanted. 

*2 She weeps bitterly in the night,*
*with tears on her cheeks;*
*among all her lovers*
*she has none to comfort her;*
*all her friends have dealt treacherously with her;*
*they have become her enemies.*

The depiction continues with the betrayal of her friends and the abandonment of all her lovers. Just like the prodigal son (see Luke 15:11) who had many friends for as long as he had money. Here too, as soon as she is left without anything of worth, her friends and her lovers abandon her. 

*3 Judah has gone into exile because of affliction*
*and hard servitude;*
*she dwells now among the nations,*
*but finds no resting place;*
*her pursuers have all overtaken her*
*in the midst of her distress.*

If Jerusalem is the princess, then Judah must be her guardian, such as her brother or father. The guardian has left and now she has no place to go. A striking similarity of the situation has been depicted in the movie #tags/movies *Empire of the Sun* starring Christian Bale #tags/famouspeople who stars as a spoiled English child in China whose parents had to flee for the Japanese invasion and in their rush were not able to bring their son along. 
Just like in the case of Jerusalem, the invasion of the enemy was because of the child's disobedience, and now that his parents have fled and all food and water had dried up, he had to dwell among the others who lived on the street, the godless and criminal people, who even stole his shoes. 

 *4 The roads to Zion mourn,*
*for none come to the festival;*
*all her gates are desolate;*
*her priests groan;*
*her virgins have been afflicted,*
*and she herself suffers bitterly.*
*5 Her foes have become the head;*
*her enemies prosper,*
*because the LORD has afflicted her*
*for the multitude of her transgressions;*
*her children have gone away,*
*captives before the foe.*

It is Jerusalem herself who has transgressed, not merely once, but she has committed a multitude of transgressions. Jerusalem's punishment was separate from what the people of Israel and Judah had done. There was a separation between those two kingdoms, but even between Judah and Jeruzalem there was some sort of barrier, for we saw that (all #todo/opzoeken ?) the cities in Judah were taken by the Assyrians, but Jerusalem was left standing in the time of Hezekiah, due to his obedience and affliction (not God's affliction towards him, but his own, towards himself).
Now Jerusalem's enemies prospered at the cost of her suffering. For sure, a famine would have caused both friend and foe to suffer the same consequences, but God did not choose this kind of outcome, but one that would prosper her enemies so as to increase Jerusalem's suffering, just like any person on Earth would feel when his enemies are doing better than they are. 
To make things even worse, her children have gone away, not out of rebellion, but they have been taken captive by this same foe! Of all people, why did this foe had to prosper? 
We saw the same things happening to Judah, when among others Daniel and his friends as one of its children. Babylon prospered while Judah was suffering, for the same reasons Jerusalem was now suffering. It was, however, through these children that the Babylonian empire treated the Jewish people well and that Cyrus eventually let the Jewish people return to their country. 
In the same way the captivity of Jerusalem has had its own purpose even if we do not clearly see it.

*6 From the daughter of Zion*
*all her majesty has departed.*
*Her princes have become like deer*
*that find no pasture;*
*they fled without strength*
*before the pursuer.*

There was royalty who fled to Egypt and forced Jeremiah to come with them. Even they, who had enjoyed splendor and materials and land as royalty, not because of anything they had done, but only because of their bloodline and inheritance from David, were supposed to rule the country and even take the position of king in the situation where he and his next of kin were no longer present, such as in the case of Jehoiakim #todo/opzoeken who was taken captive to Babylon. 

*7 Jerusalem ::remembers::*
*in the days of her affliction and wandering*
*all the precious things*
*that were hers from days of old.*

It is not a melancholy that is depicted here, but rather a realization of the things she had and did not appreciate at the time.

*When ::her:: people fell into the hand of the foe,*
*and there was none to help her,*
*her foes gloated over her;*
*they mocked at her downfall.*



*8 Jerusalem sinned grievously;*
*therefore she became filthy;*
*all who honored her despise her,*
*for they have seen her nakedness;*
*she herself groans*
*and turns her face away.*

Israel and Jerusalem have aways had enemies, but there was a time when there were some who honored them. The king of Babylon before the neo-Babylonian empire under Nebuchadnezzar, for example, honored king Hezekiah of Judah, by that time left to only the city of Jerusalem and other countries paid tribute to Judah and Jerusalem as well perhaps also out of fear for the God of Israel, but nevertheless there was genuine honor. 
Now, however, Jerusalem has even left her own God and become adulterous with other gods. Just like Jerusalem a man or a woman could have both people who honor them and who despise them. But how many would find a woman, in this case, honorable if she left her own husband who was good to her, in order to sleep with, to serve and sacrifice her own children to other men? The enemies will despise her even more because whatever honorable thing she had in their eyes has disappeared now, and those who found her honorable have lost all reason for it. 
**Example.** In America the well-known fastfood chain for fried chicken *Chick-Fil-A*, owned by a Christian who (only) hires Christian employees and does not open on Sundays for obvious reasons used to donate only to Christian charities. They came under fire when the CEO mentioned that a marriage according to the Bible's definition is between a man and a woman. As soon as that happened Left-America went to boycott Chick-Fil-A promoting this through Twitter. 
Chick-Fil-A has its enemies, which are intolerent people who are pro-LGBT. But even among those there might have been some who saw honor in them when they opened up on *Sunday* in order to provide lunches for firemen and volunteers when there was a natural disaster, and when they provided lunch for all people in the airport when their flights got cancelled.  
As a result of these things, but especially the boycott, Chick-Fil-A's sales went through the roof, probably mostly by Christians supporting them. However, instead of making a stronger stand against LGBT and for the Biblical definition of marriages, they caved when they got criticism on the donating of a part of their profits to only Christian charities. Then, from 2019 on, they started donating to non-Christian charities as well who provided help to LGBT-communities and supported the cause. 
As an excuse they said that the charities do not discriminate in helping people of any kind, just like the *Army of Salvation* helps both Christians, non-Christians, gays and heterosexuals alike, but that they are missing the point that some of the groups they donated to were actually supporting the LGBT-*cause*. 
And just like that, they were out of the news. I have not heard about any economic downfall, and since this has been their only point of failure—in my opinion and as far as I know—I do expect to see God's mercy here. On the other hand, though, COVID-19 has had a negative impact on all restaurants and businesses and it would only be through divine or supernatural intervention if a restaurant were to stay standing, maintain its revenue or even keep growing. Chick-Fil-A had a probability to be one of those exceptional restaurants, but they threw away (that part of) their blessing, by building on their foundation with flammable and cheap materials. 

*9 Her uncleanness was in her skirts;*
*she took no thought of her future;*
*therefore her fall is terrible;*
*she has no comforter.*

A fall is all the more terrible when one has not thought of the future and made plans for calamities. Jerusalem had no comforter and all of her material possessions had been taken away. She was reckless in her behavior and trusted in her allies, those having been, among others, Syria and Egypt, among who none ultimately comforted her. 

*“O LORD, behold my affliction,*
*for the enemy has triumphed!”*
*10 The enemy has ::stretched:: out his hands*
*over all her precious things;*

Even though the enemy has stretched out his hands to grasp what was in the sanctuary, just like Babylon has done (see Ezra 1:7), God has stretched out His hand as well but in a much more authoritative and powerful way (see Isaiah 14:27). Note the singular, for God merely needs to stretch out a single hand with which He can cover the span of both hands and arms of His foes. 

*for she has seen the nations*
*enter her sanctuary,*
*those whom ::you:: forbade*
*to enter your congregation.*



*11 All her people groan*
*as they search for bread;*
*they trade their treasures for food*
*to revive their strength.*
*“Look, O LORD, and see,*
*for I am despised.”*

This is the first time the daughter speaks to God. She realizes that she needs to speak out and admit that she is helpless. How often do we not see in movies popular girls, who usually cheerleaders, relentlessly restraining themselves to ask for help or for a chance to express their actual needs? They have no place where they feel safe enough to do so. Only when they realize they have lost *everything*, even their supposed friends as well as their popularity do they become normal again with a slight and sometimes temporary feeling of humility. The movie #tags/movies *Can't buy me love* somewhat shows this result of losing everything, though in this case it is the guy, played by Patrick Dempsey #tags/famouspeople, who loses everything, and retreats himself and cries himself to sleep. He did not know God and had nowhere to go. 
The princess or widow in this story, however, still has God, somewhere tucked away, far in the back of her head or deep inside of her heart. That is her way out. It is because of this mercy, that God had tucked this truth in her heart, that He has taught her in her past long ago that He was the One Who created her and brought her up from nothing. Even more so, that He brought her out of the adulterous life (cf. Hosea 2) she was in order to become a princess and a bride. 

*12 “Is it nothing ::to you::, all you who pass by?*
*Look and see*
*if there is any sorrow like my sorrow,*
*which was brought upon me,*
*which the LORD inflicted*
*on the day of his fierce anger.*

Why is Jerusalem crying out to the bypassers? Is it to get comfort from them? I think not. Jerusalem at this point has already called on the Lord and realized her own transgressions. She is not looking for comfort from bypassers or other nations. 
She clearly wants the bypassers to know about the sorrow that can be inflicted by the Lord, as if warning them of the anger of God. In the next verses she describes how God does this and what she felt. 

*13 “From on high he sent fire;*
*into my bones he made it descend;*
*he spread a net for my feet;*
*he turned me back;*
*he has left me stunned,*
*faint all the day long.*

She describes the inflictions caused on her, but she does not describe herself as a victim (see verse 14). She realizes that God did all this to *turn her back*. 
Turning back is an action the inflicted needs to do voluntarily. One needs to make this choice himself. What God *can* do, however, is to prevent someone from going any further. Just like He left Jerusalem stunned and faint, as if in a drowse so that at least the person cannot walk further towards the gates of hell, in the same way God prevents us from sinking any deeper into sin by stopping us and retaining us in our doubts.

*14 “My transgressions were bound into a yoke;*
*by his hand they were fastened together;*
*they were set upon my neck;*
*he caused my strength to fail;*
*the Lord gave me into the hands*
*of those whom I cannot withstand.*

All of these steps were admittedly done by God, but this also means that God was there every  step of the way. When God gathered her transgressions He was with her and when He set these on her neck, He was there as well. All of this time she had been near Him, but not once did she call out to the Lord for relief. For the Lord is merciful—as we will see in 3:23—and a broken reed He will not break. Jerusalem should have known this. 

*15 “The Lord rejected*
*all my mighty men in my midst;*
*he summoned an assembly against me*
*to crush my young men;*
*the Lord has trodden as in a winepress*
*the virgin daughter of Judah.*

The way the Lord works is by first destroying all that can seduce one or that one can possibly depend on, other than God. In this God crushes the young men. Those young men could have been Jerusalem's lovers and seducers, if Jerusalem were an actual woman, but it is more likely that these were young men fit to serve as soldiers. They were, however, crushed by the assembly, probably that of Babylon. 
Then, God trods on Jerusalem as in a winepress, not once, like when walks on the streets, but over and over again until all the juice is out of the grapes, with either the feet or with a mechanical press of which the forces are greater than of any human hand. 

*16 “For these things I weep;*
*my eyes flow with tears;*
*for a comforter is far from me,*
*one to revive my spirit;*
*my children are desolate,*
*for the enemy has prevailed.”*
*17 Zion stretches out her hands,*
*but there is none to comfort her;*
*the LORD has commanded against Jacob*
*that his neighbors should be his foes;*
*Jerusalem has become*
*a filthy thing among them.*

Jerusalem knows that it is God Who did this to her, because of her own transgressions, and she knows that no one and nothing can stop God and no one can comfort her if God does not allow it. The only thing she can do is calling out to God begging for His mercy and hoping that He will extend it to her. She knows, however, that now is not that day, for her inflictions have not been fulfilled yet. 
The only thing she can do, is changing her ways and wait for the Day of the Lord when He shall come and save her. This would take another 70 years. 

*18 “The LORD is in the ::right::,*
*for I have rebelled against his word;*

Here is an explicit admission of Jerusalem of her rebellion against God's Word. 

*but hear, all you peoples,*
*and see my suffering;*
*my young women and my young men*
*have gone into captivity.*
*19 “I called to my lovers,*
*but they deceived me;*
*my priests and elders*
*perished in the city,*
*while they sought food*
*to revive their strength.*
*20 “Look, O LORD, for I am in distress;*
*my stomach churns;*
*my heart is wrung within me,*
*because I have been very rebellious.*
*In the street the sword bereaves;*
*in the house it is like death.*
*21 “They heard my groaning,*
*yet there is no one to comfort me.*
*All my enemies have heard of my trouble;*
*they are glad that you have done it.*
*You have brought the day you announced;*
*now let them be as I am.*
*22 “Let all their evildoing come before you,*
*and deal with them*
*as you have dealt with me*
*because of all my transgressions;*
*for my groans are many,*
*and my heart is faint.”*

It is very #todo/opzoeken/engels paradoxaal is misschien niet het juiste woord. It seems like it is unavoidable for Israel's enemies to receive God's punishments. 
What seems to happen every time Israel or Judah disobeys, is that God sends another country to attack Israel, after which He strikes down that country because they hurt His children. This seems to be unfair, for it is God Who called that country to execute a punishment, but then God punishes the country for doing exactly what it was told to. 
We know, however, that the enemies were not actually listening to or obeying God. They merely had one or more reasons not to go out against Israel, for example because of bad weather conditions or being occupied by another matter. So when God removed this factor #todo/opzoeken/engels they had no more reason not to attack Israel. So God punishes them for their actual actions. Another argument why God is fair and just, is because after having defeated Israel—even if it was only to obey God's command—they gloated over Israel (v.7) and perhaps even raped the women (v.4). 
Footnote: Gill's Exposition explains that these young women were supposed to parade or feast during the festival and they cannot do so anymore, but the ESV translation inserts a footnote there with the Old Latin translation that this meant "dragged away" which indicates a kidnap of the young women. 
Jeremiah seems to know about this pattern and now that Jerusalem has been attacked— #todo/opzoeken if this is about Jerusalem—he asks the Lord to exert His vengeance. This seems like a strange practice. When one has been punished justly (v.18)—and the Lord has even been merciful (see 3:23), i.e. He punished them less than they deserved—how can one say then that now the ones who inflicted the punishment should be punished? It can only be said in this way: Jeremiah stands on God's promise to pour out His wrath on anyone who mistreats His children and God holds true to His promise whether Israel is obedient or not. 
Notice that God did not have to make such a promise. He could have made a covenant, which would require obedience from the counter party, which is Israel. Also, Abraham never considered receiving a compensation of God for his own obedience and faithfulness towards God—neither could he or dared he ever consider that of God.
