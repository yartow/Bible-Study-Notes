# Lamentations 4 (ESV) 
**The Holy Stones Lie Scattered**
*1 How the gold has grown dim,*
*how the pure gold is changed!*
*The holy stones lie scattered*
*at the head of every street.*

The holy stones from the ephod of Aaron, worn by the high priests, as a symbol for the twelve tribes of Israel, were not scattered—figuratively, of course, but literally speaking the twelve tribes were scattered not only throughout Israel but also throughout all of the Middle-East and later on even further to wherever the Assyrian Empire extended. #tags/diaspora #todo/nogaftemaken Iets schrijven over Joodse stammen die gevonden zijn in Afrika en India. 
But the figure of speech used here, i.e. on the street, also says that these stones are defiled now. So not only are they scattered, they are on the street, touching the unholy and defiled ground where everyone walks and treads—perhaps even on the stones themselves!—without the protection of the ephod #todo/opzoeken the thing in which the twelve jewel stones were #todo/opzoeken/engels vastgemaakt, verborgen.

*2 The precious ::sons of Zion::,* #todo/opzoeken  #biblestudy/questions
*worth their weight in fine gold,*
*how they are regarded as earthen pots,*
*the work of a potter's hands!*

The sons of Zion could be referring to the children of Jerusalem, perhaps only the male ones, who have been called for holiness. Of course, everyone has been called to a holy life, but in the big city, near the temple, one could have positions within the temple for the priests and Levites. 
Or perhaps the "sons" are referring to the kings in the line of David and those in line for the throne. It is common for kings and royalty to behave well and be exemplary. Great-Britain is a good and bad example of that. They try to behave and be exemplary with good looks, speaking proper English, well-behaving children and submissive hat-wearing wives. In reality their behavior is far from the moral standards of God, but leaving that aside, their intention is to show the people how well they behave, as royalty should. Some things should be beneath royalty, such as immoral actions. In the same way the sons of David, i.e. everyone in the royal line of David, should behave properly, whether a king or not. But now they are regarded as earthen pots. 
We have seen the behavior of the "princes" of Judah in Nehemiah—it is not certain whether they were family of David, but at least Sanballat in Nehemia 2:10 was a governor, someone who should have been morally incorrupt—when the latter tried rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. The princes were not helping and mocking and discouraging and perhaps even inciting others to break down the walls at night. 
Earthen pots are not like gold in any way. Though this verse could be interpreted as very valuable pots, just like Ming vases which were made with an expensive kind of porcelain, with many hours of hand-painted decorations on them, this was probably not meant here. Yes, it is a potter who made them, but that also shows where it got its value from, for ceramic itself, like clay, is not worth much. Gold, on the other hand, has intrinsic value. 
Now, these princes worth as much as the people deemed them, which was not much anymore, while they used to have their value imbued on them by God. 

*3 Even jackals offer the breast;*
*they nurse their young;*
*but the daughter of my people has become cruel,*
*like the ::ostriches:: in the wilderness.* #todo/opzoeken 

If this verse has to do with the previous one, then the value of these princes has decreased so much because of their cruel actions, and where leaders go bad, their followers do the same. The people of Israel, but more specifically, Judah, have become cruel to people. As I have mentioned #todo/opzoeken  waar? elsewhere in this devotional, God's wrath comes when His Name is defiled, e.g. when the Israelites commit adultery with other gods, but also when the weaker people in society are hurt. Hence Jesus used the story (Footnote: note that this is not called a parable as this has probably really happened.) of Lazarus and the rich man to depict how God takes care of the poor. 

*4 The tongue of the nursing infant sticks*
*to the roof of its mouth for thirst;*
*the children beg for food,*
*but no one gives to them.*

Did the Israelites neglect the care for their children or is this a punishment from God as a result of Israel's infidelity? God loves children. The only reason He would allow this to happen is if it were for a greater cause. If the Israelites did not turn from their wicked ways even more children would die. The Israelites destroyed themselves, by sacrificing their children. They destroyed their economy through corruption and perhaps by all kinds of other things, just like the West has incorporated socialism #tags/politics/economics #tags/socialism and increased tax rates which has severely impacted the economy of the United States. 
Things would most certainly have gone worse. The Judahite and Israelite armies were not strong enough to defend themselves against their enemies, also as a result of the above. In 2 Chronicles we see a clear decrease in the size of the armies. Where the number of people begun in the millions it ended up in about 80.000 for the people of Uzziah. Repeatedly we read in 2 Kings about the temple and all the gold being raided. Whatever treasure there was left in the country, it was gone now. 
Of course, their loss to the neighboring countries—and later the empires of Assyrians and Babylon which no country could resist—was not merely due to the small size of their army, but their victory in Hezekiah's time was, and it could have been all throughout the period of the Kings, if only they had subordinated themselves to God Almighty. 
In a sense God saved the people from further perishing. The Name this people carried, which was the Lord Yahweh's, was (mostly) lost by the diaspora of the Ten Tribes, but their lives were mostly saved—at least those who lives had not been taken by the Assyrians during the bloody war, or perhaps better said massacre. 
The lives of the people in the South, the tribes of Benjamin, Judah and all who lived there, that is #todo/opzoeken a part or all of a few tribes who left the North and migrated to the South upon an invitation from Hezekiah to worship the Lord again, plus the Levites living in their designated cities, where mostly (I think #todo/opzoeken ) saved by the Babylonians, but exiled to Babylon to serve there, except for those who had to stay behind in Israel (north and south) to take care of the land, which was about 90 percent by the way #todo/opzoeken.
Either way, God ended the slaughter in this way or the total number of deaths would have been higher. 
This might be contradictory with verse 6, but see the notes there. 

*5 Those who once feasted on delicacies*
*perish in the streets;*
*those who were brought up in purple*
*embrace ash heaps.*

It does not matter how rich one was or what heritage one has, everyone will suffer from the punishment of God . If even the relatively good ones, such as the prophets, and the relatively innocent ones, the children, were not spared from death, how then one who indulged in wealth—especially those who did not help the poor—be saved from this? 

*6 For the chastisement of the daughter of my people has been greater*
*than the punishment of Sodom,*
*which was overthrown in a ::moment::,*
*and no hands were ::wrung:: for her.*

In terms of pain the punishment of Sodom was better, because the fire and brimstone from heaven killed the Sodomites almost instantly, seeing that there have been found pools or at least pieces of glass, which can only be explained by extreme heat. 
The impact, however, on the people of Sodom was definitely greater, for no one survived, while after the punishment of Israel and Judah, some of the Israelite and Judahite people are still present, although the Name of God they carried has mostly and often times completely dissipated. 
Another way the punishment of the Israelites was worse is because no hands were wrung for herm in other words, there was no one who mourned for her, outside of the afflicted. If it were Judah alone who were afflicted, the Israelites would probably have been cheering and vice versa. Now that both countries were afflicted all of the surrounding countries, which were their enemies as well, would have been cheering, had they not been captured by Babylon themselves. 
Israel and Judah had no friends. They only had each other and God. Now they had a strife with each other and a hatred more intense than that for their neighbors—which is common among family members—but in a world where God is one's only friend, it is not wise to make enemies out of one's only friends. 

*7 Her princes were purer than snow,*
*whiter than milk;*
*their bodies were more ruddy than coral,*
*the beauty of their form was like sapphire.*
*8 Now their face is blacker than soot;*
*they are not recognized in the streets;*
*their skin has shriveled on their bones;*
*it has become as dry as wood.*

From the princes' worth to their outer appearance, they have completely changed to an unrecognizable figure. Just like movie stars who get hooked on drugs or other people who become drug addicts and end up on the streets are almost completely unrecognizable if one were not to pay attention to them. Worldly seen the worst thing is that when they were normal they had a beauty or talent  that was above average, and now they have sunk to the bottom. 
Take for example #tags/famouspeople Philip Seymour Hoffman, an Academy Award®-winner for #tags/movies #todo/opzoeken in cold blood... who was an amazingly talented actor and had so much of a future ahead of him, but died at the young age of #todo/opzoeken  forty, not even to speak of people like James Dean #tags/famouspeople and what they could have accomplished had they lived.

*9 Happier were the victims of the sword*
*than the victims of hunger,*
*who wasted away, pierced*
*by lack of the fruits of the field.*

Another example that shows the gravity of the Israelites' affliction compared to the Sodomites, is in their hunger. Not only is it the longevity of the pain and death around them, which they had to endure, but also the hunger they themselves had to endure, which literally brought them to insanity (in my opinion) and kill their own children. 

*10 The hands of ::compassionate women*::
::*have boiled their own children;*::
*they became their food*
*during the destruction of the daughter of my people.*

It seems as if God says here that because Israel killed God's people or the daughter thereof, therefore they will kill their own children as well. Israel does not feel any remorse about this, however, except for perhaps a few of the parents whose children were forcibly taken away from them to be sacrificed by Molech or who were like the woman who did not want her child to be eaten—even though she was willing to another mother's—during the time of Jehoram in Israel.

Another example of an extreme change in people showing what they are capable of when sin takes over their life, is not depicted here in verse 10, but stated as an actual fact that happened in these days. Note that these children were not sacrificed to gods, but were killed only to survive themselves. So selfish and self-loving were the people that they had rather they live than their children. 
The extreme change is in this part. 
1. Not only are these people who kill, but they are women, while usually it is men who do this. 
2. Not only are they killing people, but they are killing children. 
3. Not only are they normal people, but they used to be compassionate people. 
4. Not only are these women who kill, but they are mothers. A mother would have significantly more problems with killing a child, even if it is not hers, than woman who has never had a child herself. 
5. Not only are they mothers who kill children, but they are killing their own children. 
6. Not only that, but they are even boiling and eating them. 

The steps needed to become as cruel and heartless as these mothers are many. Sin did not seep into their lives, it flushed in like a river pours its water into the sea. The Israelites had set their hearts open to sin in many ways—in all ways of sex, materialism, abuse of power and now even in parenthood and cannibalism. 

*11 The LORD gave full vent to his wrath;*
*he poured out his hot anger,*
*and he kindled a fire in Zion*
*that consumed its foundations.*

It is only logical if God releases His full anger—although I do believe that the word "full" is symbolically meant, for no atom or quark of the Earth itself would be left if God vents Himself fully—because of the sins committed in verse 10. One could easily point the blame to God for providing the circumstances for the Israelites to sin. It was God Who let the Babylonians raid Jerusalem to make them poor and hungry with nothing left to eat. However, one forgets then that God had given them ample chance to repent. Even before the raiding they could have repented and turn from their wicked ways; during and after the raids there was still the opportunity for it. However, not once did Israel repent and rather than praying to God for food, they turned to their own offspring.

*12 The kings of the earth ::did not believe::,*
*nor any of the inhabitants of the world,*
*that foe or enemy could enter*
*the gates of Jerusalem.*
*13 This was for the sins of her prophets*
*and the iniquities of her priests,*
*who shed in the midst of her*
*the blood of the righteous.*

Even the priests and prophets were committing serious crimes. What is even worse is that they did this in the midst of Jerusalem, the holy city of God. 
The point that these two verses are making is that no one thought it was possible to conquer Jerusalem. Jerusalem had been conquered previously in the days of Joshua or those of the Judges #todo/opzoeken , but that was a long time ago. Canaan was divided back then, Jerusalem, which then had a different name, was perhaps not supported by the armies of the other cities, partially because some or many of those they had already been defeated by Israel, and furthermore, they had a weaker god than Yahweh, the God of the Israelites. 
But ever since Israel possessed the land of Canaan, Jerusalem had never been taken, that is until Jerobeam's reign #todo/opzoeken He was the second king to leave God. The first one was Solomon but he was blessed because of God's promise to his father. As soon as a king would leave God, even the strongest and most fortified cities with the most and best trained soldiers would still be easily conquered, just like Israel conquered and broke the walls of Jericho, without any effort. 
So Israel's enemies did not know that Jerusalem could be conquered and thought that the city was invincible. They could have easily deduced that it was only because of their God that they had been successful, as they should have known from history during the many times they lost against the Philistines for example, each time they were disobedient. Had they known this, they would have certainly seduced the Israelites into temptation to follow their gods and then invaded Jerusalem. Unfortunately the Israelites themselves were not very clear of mind—or better said, haughty and proud—and did not know that that was the reason for their failure and now their ultimate affliction—the complete destruction of Israel and Judah, its people, the temple and now their land through the exile to Babylon. 

*14 They wandered, blind, through the streets;*
*they were so defiled with blood*
*that no one was able to touch*
*their garments.*

The opposite of Jesus and Paul, who were so holy that merely touching their garments or shadow would bring healing—through faith, that is, not through the garment itself—where here one becomes unclean when touching the priests' and prophets' clothes—of all people the ones who should be the most holiest of all become the unholiest and most desecrated.
Or perhaps there was so much clotted blood on their garments that when one thinks one touches the garment, he has not even penetrated the thick layer of blood and has touched that instead of the garment itself. 

*15 “Away! Unclean!” people cried at them.*
*“Away! Away! Do not touch!”*
*So they became fugitives and wanderers;*
*people said among the nations,*
*“They shall stay with us no longer.”*

It is clear that the priests and prophets were no longer holy and that the people did not want to become defiled by touching them, as if they were lepers. The ironic part about this is that it is the people say this, who themselves are as unholy as described in the parts before. So even to the people who desecrated themselves with idolatry and cannibalism these priests and prophets are defiled. How defiled must one be then? 
This is not necessarily because the priests and prophets have—worldly seen—broken more laws than the people, but rather because they have broken more spiritual laws. The responsibility of these men was higher because of their position (cf. Luke 12:48), their purpose was greater and hence their defilement was greater when they sinned. 
Furthermore, they did not commit the same sins as the people did, they actually *led* the people to sin or to sin more. They told the people lies (see Lamentations 2:14) and that is very serious sin, more serious than others when interpreted from Mark 9:42 (Footnote: The "little ones" may be interpreted as the innocent ones. In this particular case the people were neither children nor innocent, but still more unknowing than the prophets and priests who should be teachers as well.).   

*16 The LORD himself has scattered them;*
*he will regard them no more;*
*no honor was shown to the priests,*
*no favor to the elders.*
*17 Our eyes failed, ever watching*
*vainly for help;*
*in our watching we watched*
*for a nation which could not save.*

It was never the nation or God that could save the people of Israel, but Jeremiah probably means here that, just like in the foundation of the United States, it had always been the intention that the nation would place the right foundation for the people to thrive in. In the United States this foundation has been laid in the Constitution, which itself is founded in the Bible, but people step over it, diminishing the Amendments that give right to free speech, protection of oneself and the gathering as a church. Israel, however, had the Bible and its Law itself as its constitution and ignored it in a matter worse than the United States is doing right now. At least the latter still has courts and the Supreme Court which rule over these constitutional matters—in Israel the priests, who were the judges (presumably, at least in Jesus' time the High Priest was the judge of the Sanhedrin, which was similar to the Highest Court or current day's Supreme Court), were corrupt and led by the laws of the idols. 
Sadly, America is going this way as well. All we can do, is pray that God will have mercy on us when this day happens, or that He will prevent this from happening and turn the hearts of those instigating it. 

*18 They dogged our steps*
*so that we could not walk in our streets;*
*our end drew near; our days were numbered,*
*for our end had come.*

They way the Left prevents others goes so far that they do not even want people to be out on the streets. #tags/politics Here too the priests and prophets, the *leaders*, made sure that no one could go out and prevent the end from happening. Jeremiah's mouth was shut when he wanted to prophesy about not to migrate to Egypt and that they would be killed there (see Jeremiah 43), but he was shut up and posed as a liar. 
In the current day people are standing up to spill out the truth about COVID-19, the truth behind the *Black Lives Matter* movement etc. but no media or other news outlet is willing to publicize it. 

*19 Our pursuers were swifter*
*than the eagles in the heavens;*
*they chased us on the mountains;*
*they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.*

Everywhere we go the Left c.q. the devil, is present to block Christians and our values—even within the church. Everywhere in the media, in every social media channel, in every entertainment channel and almost every university. Just like verse 19 says, the devil is swifter than the eagles in heaven. They invented the mobile phone and planned on using it against Christians long before we thought of the possibility. They invented mass entertainment long before we thought of indoctrination. They thought of ways for mass communication and social media to gather data long before we (or at least most Christians) realized they were controlling our social and online behavior and in effect our offline behavior as well. With new technology the devil is always running ahead of us and chasing us wherever we go. Soon there will be no place on Earth anymore where we can be free—free in the broadest sense, but also free from technology and the Left's influence. 
Christians need to create their own society in order to protect our children. If we do not, but let them join this society, no matter how good things look, even if it is regarded as "Christian" such as Christian schools or other institutions, the devil is waiting and luring in the darkest and tiniest corners. 

*20 The breath of our nostrils, the LORD'S anointed,*
*was captured in their pits,*
*of whom we said, “Under his shadow*
*we shall live among the nations.”*

The breath of our nostrils is referring to the Holy Spirit Who has been blown into our bodies, but what is the Lord's anointed referring to then? Normally it would be the Christ, which means the anointed in Greek, but we know that He is not the same as the Holy Spirit. #biblestudy/questions Secondly, we also know that neither of Them are captured by the enemy. What we do know, however, is that the Holy Spirit has departed from the Israelites *as if* it had been captured. 

*21 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom,*
*you who dwell in the land of Uz;*
*but to you also the cup shall pass;*
*you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare.*

Regardless of culture and the age people live in, nudity has always been shameful. Even these days when people are almost completely nude on the beach and call it swimwear, few dare to go another step and almost all will feel that nudity is shameful. However, in earlier and Biblical days, when even the uncovering of shoulders or of a male chest was considered naked, even then there were women who stripped themselves bare. I will assume this is completely naked because that matches the sin of Edom and Uz. Perhaps this is because of the drunkenness, for when one is drunk he will know no limits. 

*22 The punishment of your iniquity, O daughter of Zion, is accomplished;*
*he will keep you in exile no longer;*
*but your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he will punish;*
*he will uncover your sins.*

All daughters have sinned, that is all the people. Israel has sinned most, because she had the knowledge, hence she is punished first. As a consequence, however, the other countries saw Israel being punished and laughed at her. They would have initially received a lesser punishment, but the situation has become really complex now. 
First of all, they would have received less punishment because they had less knowledge of God's Law than the Israelites. However, they had seen the afflictions caused on them for disobeying God for ages, so they have no excuse in saying that they did not know the power of Israel's God. This would increase their punishment. 
Second of all, they laughed at Israel when she got punished. This too increased their punishment. 
Third of all, Israel was punished in at least four separate periods, first the ten tribes in the north were deported to Assyria and then the two tribes (actually, there were more, but see elsewhere in #todo/opzoeken  Isaiah #todo/nogaftemaken  waar heb ik dit ook alweer opgeschreven?) in the south were exiled to Babylon in *three phases*. Each of the four times this happened they had a chance to repent, but they did not. 
We do not know (at least, *I* do not know) what happened with the Edomites as a people during the rise of the Assyrian, Babylon and Persian empires, but if Haman and Herod, who both were Edomites, represented their own people, then we know that the Edomites still bore the hatred toward their cousin, Israel, for the sin caused by its forefather Jakob to their forefather Esau. Furthermore, all we do know is that after the First Jewish War (66-73 AD) nothing has been heard from neither the Edomites nor the Idumeans, which are a related but geographically elsewhere located people.
