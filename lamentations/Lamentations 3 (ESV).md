# Lamentations 3 (ESV) 
***Great Is Your Faithfulness***
*1 I am the man who has seen affliction*
*under the rod of his wrath;*
*2 he has driven and brought me*
*into darkness without any light;*
*3 surely against me he turns his hand*
*again and again the whole day long.*

With the punishment against Israel's deeds in mind, it seems in verse 1 like Jeremiah is only perceiving this affliction and not experiencing it. Surely, because he was in the land and among the people he suffered from it as well, just like any person would in an economy that collapsed, unless he would have a privileged position. But in verse 3 we see that God's hand was against Jeremiah himself. 
Why would God be against Jeremiah and what has he done wrong that is worthy of this punishment? Perhaps he is speaking in emotional terms, just like David wrote in Psalm #todo/opzoeken  that "the whole world" was against him. Or perhaps Jeremiah meant that he too is part of the sin of Israel. 

*4 He has made my flesh and my skin waste away;*
*he has broken my bones;*
*5 he has besieged and enveloped me*
*with bitterness and tribulation;*
*6 he has made me dwell in darkness*
*like the dead of long ago.*

The skeletons of the dead have brittle bones when they have been in the grave for a long time and their flesh and skin are wasted away. Jeremiah has the same feeling because all that is around is a sort of darkness consisting of bitterness and tribulation. If God is light, then the absence of God is everything he is seeing around him, which is a lack of joy and happiness, blessings and abundance. 
Perhaps Jeremiah is trying to symbolize not only how much Jerusalem #todo/opzoeken  is like a grave right now (how would he know, because he is writing this from Babylon, but perhaps through prophecy or through the stories told by the men who came in the second exile #biblestudy/questions) but also how long this is taken—long enough for a dead person's skin to waste away if he were under the ground. 

*7 He has walled me about so that I cannot escape;*
*he has made my chains heavy;*

Jeremiah is walled in as a prisoner, as punishment for his sins. Cf. Hosea 2:6 where Gomer is surrounded by a wall and a hedge. This was done for Gomer's protection so that she would not be able to find the paths that led to her former lovers. Here, however, Jeremiah (or Israel) is not protected by this wall to give him time to think and repent. Verses 8-10 even claim God did this to block Jeremiah's call for help, because God did not want to listen to his cries and pleas. 

*8 though I call and cry for help,*
*he shuts out my prayer;*
*9 he has blocked my ways with blocks of stones;*
*he has made my paths crooked.*
*10 He is a bear lying in wait for me,*
*a lion in hiding;*
*11 he turned aside my steps and tore me to pieces;*
*he has made me desolate;*
*12 he bent his bow and set me*
*as a target for his arrow.*
*13 He drove into my kidneys*
*the arrows of his quiver;*
*14 I have become the laughingstock of all peoples,*
*the object of their taunts all day long.*

God did all of this because He *willed* to afflict the Israelites, not because he *wanted* it, but because He had said He would and therefore has to do so. He has made the path of Israel crooked so that He could punish them for the crookedness. #todo/opzoeken Referentie zoeken naar waar dit eerder is uitgelegd. 
Now for those Israelites whose hearts had been hardened anyway this would be just, but what about those who are righteous, like Jeremiah? Why should these be afflicted in such a way to become the target for God's arrows? Would that not be too harsh of God? 
No, God is righteous in every way. Even to the prophet Jeremiah for even he would deserve a harsher punishment than the one that Jerusalem received. 

*15 He has filled me with bitterness;*
*he has sated me with wormwood.*
*16 He has made my teeth grind on gravel,*
*and made me cower in ashes;*
*17 my soul is bereft of peace;*
*I have forgotten what happiness is;*
*18 so I say, “My endurance has perished;*
*so has my hope from the LORD.”*
*19 Remember my affliction and my wanderings,*
*the wormwood and the gall!*
*20 My soul continually remembers it*
*and is bowed down within me.*

Jeremiah writes about himself in verses 18-21, but it might just as well have been written about Paul, though he did not know him. As a matter of fact, most likely every prophet or person who notably suffered for the Lord could have written something similar. 

Our soul continually remembers all the agony we have been through, for by nature we are self-centered creatures. Even with all the good that the Lord has done for us, we would still pity ourselves. It takes willpower, or however one would define it, to exert oneself to bring up God's mercy and see that God's love and faithfulness are greater than all the affliction we have experienced. The affliction happened in the past and ended, but God's mercy are everlasting and without limit. 

*21 But this I call to mind,*
*and therefore I have hope:*

After 19 verses of physical, mental and spiritual pain and hopelessness and being laughed at #todo/opzoeken/engels, Jeremiah needed only to remember one thing to give him hope. How great is the value of a memory, but even greater than the memory is the deed itself. What had been given to Jeremiah that a mere memory of this deed could give him hope to last all of this pain and mockery? The answer is that he did not believe, but *knew*—for a memory is knowing something that happened in the past—that God's love had not ended, and His mercy had not come to an end. It is not that God has a limited supply of love and mercy, like our spouses have, but it is limit*less*. In any and every situation God is able to provide His love for us. No matter how deep the trouble we are in, He can reach out and touch our hearts and heal us.

::*22 The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases;*::
::*his mercies never come to an end;*::
::*23 they are new every morning;*::
::*great is your faithfulness.*:: #biblestudy/memorization/nathan #church/music/lyrics/bible

In Acts 27:27 the crew and passengers of the ship had been waiting for fourteen days before they suspected they were near land, but during last and most of those fourteen days they had hope. The hope given to them by God through Paul, a few days prior when they had lost all hope, was sufficient to last until the fourteenth day; either that or that hey had sufficient hope for each day, for there was new hope every morning. 

*24 “The LORD is my portion,” says my soul,*
*“therefore I will hope in him.”*

It is only because of what is written in this verse that the great men and women of God from Hebrews 11 had faith and therefore hope in God: because the Lord was their *portion*. 
Man always longs for so much, but it is in these critical moments such as on the ship in the storm in Acts 27 (see above) that man only wants one thing: life. All other things do not matter anymore. But the people of God know—not only when their life is about to end, but even when they are young—that their share of the cake, that is their reward, is the Lord Himself. 
Even secular people partly believe truth. They realize—although the realization usually comes people become older—that if there was one thing they could have done different in their life, it would be on the field of relationships and especially those that need mending. Ultimately, it is not money, power or materialism or any of those other worldly things—even secular people realize this according to research. Christians, however, go a step further and know that even relationships are not part of the most important thing they need. It is *the Lord Himself* Whom we need. That alone is sufficient and should be chosen above everything else. 

There is another question that needs to be answered before we really understand what the meaning is of the first part of verse 24 and that is why Jeremiah uses the word "therefore". It is for this reason: Everyone gets something in life—perhaps only *one* thing—and that is the *only* thing they can (i.e. they are able to) hope in. 
Let us take the example of the fairy tale *Puss in Boots*. A windmill owner had only three things to inherit #todo/opzoeken/engels afstaan, to his three sons. One received the windmill, so his only hope to make a living was in this windmill. The second son received the house, and had to think of a way to make a living with that. The third son, however, only received a cat. He had lost almost all of his hope for a better living, because a cat could not make him any money. The last bit of hope—and the last of his money and possessions along with it—he gave to the cat, which eventually turned out to be a wise decision. 
The third son only had two choices, either to hope or to give up hope. The latter probably meant that he would end his life, but the former meant he only had one thing to hope for, which is that the cat somehow could do something for him. 
Whether it is talents or possessions, an inheritance or something else, these hopeless and dead things are the only things we can hope in when we do not have Someone such as the Lord. These material and worldly things will not save us. If anyone has only one person left, a friend or a family member, then that is the only thing one can put his hope in, but even that person can let them down. The Lord is the only "thing" that can actually *do* something, or better yet, it can do *anything*, and will never let anyone down.

*25 The LORD is good to those who wait for him,*
*to the soul who seeks him.*
*26 It is good that one should wait quietly*
*for the salvation of the LORD.*
*27 It is good for a man that he bear*
*the yoke in his youth.*

When a man has to bear a yoke that is already hard enough, but when age is added to that, that is like an extra yoke. I cannot speak of this personally, but I can imagine. My father told me after I confronted him of having an increasing amount of anxieties as he gets older of, for example, driving too fast or doing adventurous or "risky" things in amusement parks, he told me that it is not only because he gets older, but also because he has become more responsible in the process and has more responsibilities as well. As a single person he had less to take care of, but now as the father of a household he needs to consider those who leaves behind if he passes away. 
I think that only partially explains it, because he had the same number of children now as when he was 37. The biggest explanatory factor is age itself. People bear the same yoke but it is harder on older men than on younger ones. Young men have more resilience because of their hope. 
However, Jeremiah is not only saying this because of resilience and restoration or recovery of the young man's peace. He is also saying this because a young man has more chance of changing his ways. 

*28 Let him sit alone in silence*
*when it is laid on him;*

Just like it is good for a young man to be punished and think about his ways, so that he will do them again, it is good for those who wait quietly for the Lord. In a sense Jeremiah is saying that this devastation on Jerusalem was good, because it lets the people be quiet and think about their faults. 

*29 let him put his mouth in the dust—*
*there may yet be hope;*
*30 let him give his cheek to the one who strikes,*
*and let him be filled with insults.*

This form of repentance of putting dust in one's mouth might give hope to the people. Perhaps if the people repent, there is hope that God will save them. But if the people do not repent, then they are lost forever. 
The crux here is that this is *not* the ultimate punishment! This affliction was meant to bring the people to repentance. No other thing God had done in the past for Judah has ever brought complete and inner repentance. Every king has sinned and the people went along with it. Perhaps this time the people will truly repent and God will save them. 
We already know the end and that is that even after the destruction of Jerusalem the people will not repent. They will go to Egypt to seek for help, just like Hosea prophesied in Hosea 7:... and seek for help from their lovers instead of from God. #todo/opzoeken 

*31 For the Lord will not*
*cast off forever,*

All of the above is good, as is mentioned in verses 25-27, but it is also better than having a life with riches and without trouble, but without God. It is better for a man to wait for the salvation of the Lord than to have never needed the Lord's salvation. 
The people who wait in verses 25 and 26 will not have to wait forever, for the Lord will not cast off forever. But those who do not have God will suffer forever. 
Just think about the reward: God causes grief, but His compassions is according to the abundance of His steadfast love. The grief is described in these chapters of Lamentations, but His compassion is indescribable. Verse 22-23 almost does away with all of the grief mentioned before. In a mere two verses Jeremiah says that all he needs to do to have hope is to call *this* in mind (verse 21). All he needs to do is *remember* and the hope and comfort of God is more than sufficient to cover all the grief and affliction. This is because God's compassion is according to His love, which is limitless, but His afflictions are not "new every morning." 

*32 but, though he cause grief, he will have compassion*
*according to the abundance of his steadfast love;*

#todo/nogaftemaken  voorbeeld van man die moet kiezen voor vrouw die ooit zal sterven of het nooit hebben gehad van een vrouw. 

*33 for he does not afflict from his heart*
*or grieve the children of men.*

This line ends all discussions about what God wants. God does not want to afflict people. He wants to save them. Why He does all of this is another question, that is answered elsewhere, among others, before this line in this and previous chapters. 

*34 To crush underfoot*
*all the prisoners of the earth,*
*35 to deny a man justice*
*in the presence of the Most High,*
*36 to subvert a man in his lawsuit,*
*the Lord does not approve.*

These are the things that God disapproves. Has He done those things to His people? God has given much affliction to His people, but none of the above. He has let his people be imprisoned by their enemies, but if they were crushed underfoot while in prison, it was their enemies who did it, not God Who willed it. 
That is why when the Israelites were in Egypt, whether it was just or not (there are different theories about this, but every Christian agrees that God is just), He would not allow the Egyptians to treat their "prisoners"—for in fact the Israelites were just that—in such a way, even if the Israelites deserved to be imprisoned or enslaved. (Footnote: See also https://mcarasik.wordpress.com/2012/04/03/why-were-the-israelites-enslaved/ for a thorough explanation of why the Israelites were enslaved. The author is not very clear on whether he believes this, but he provides a Biblical explanation.)

God has not denied any man justice, rather yet He has given the people what they deserved! Whatever one did not deserve, He did not get. 

*37 Who has spoken and it came to pass,*
*unless the Lord has commanded it?*

Everything that happens on Earth, and especially what happened here by Judah's enemies in Babylon, happens under the authority and sovereignty of God. Nothing happened outside of God's will. 

*38 Is it not from the mouth of the Most High*
::*that good and bad come?*::
*39 Why should a living man complain,*
*a man, about the punishment of his sins?*

The fact that the complaining person is a mere man is emphasized here. It is like an ant complaining about what one does to it, only smaller. Man will never understand—while on Earth—the ways of the Almighty. Both good and bad come out of the same mouth, but according to James 3:9-10 these things ought not to be so—for *man*. But God is sovereign and supersedes these laws given to man. 
Why should man complain when he knows that everything comes from God? If anything bad happens to one, as it did with Job, we know it comes—ultimately—from God. So if one complains, he is actually complaining to God about what He has given him. But does this person not know then that what God gives is just? So when one wants something else in fact he wants to have injustice. If a person complains about the affliction done to him, and he wants it to be removed, he wants injustice to occur—for this affliction did not happen without God's command. 

::*40 Let us test and examine our ways,*::
::*and return to the LORD!*:: #biblestudy/memorization 

Each person should do this multiple times a day, or better yet, all the time. Every time we sin we ought to know that we have sinned, but unfortunately more often the case is that we do not even know ourselves when we have sinned. 
We also need to *examine* our ways. This is not done by simply looking at what we have done or what we are doing. First of all, our *way* is that which thrives us to do what we do—it is not merely *what* we are doing. The *path* we are walking is founded by something, either it is the Bible or it is the world including all of its idols. So in everything we do, if it is founded by the Bible, only then it is the right way. 
The second thing I want to mention is that *examining* entails something far more than knowing what we have done. We need to go to our inner core and question ourselves *why* we did what we have done and how that came to be. The answer and conclusion is always because we are bad, immoral and corrupt. But it does not end there. We also need to figure out a way to prevent ourselves from sinning again and walking the same path over and over. This brings us to our next point. 
The third thing is to *test* our ways. If, upon examination, the way one is about to walk seems to be good and founded by the Bible, then it can be tested. A brother-in-law of a professor of mine quit smoking after he found out through his doctor that this was not the way he should walk in. After that he walked another way of extreme health by only eating nuts and doing much running. His cholesterol, however, increased even after this lifestyle because it was too healthy and because he did not #todo/opzoeken/engels binnenkrijg get any fats at all so that his body would produce its own cholesterol (which is something the veins and arteries #todo/opzoeken  difference between those two, 
need to stay flexible). Apparently, this guy had not tested this way by doing good research. 
As for Christians, research is a good thing, but even better is to pray about it and to ask our fellow Christians to pray for this issue and ask them for wisdom in choosing the right way. This, of course, implies that a Christian should let his fellow Christians know about the wrong paths he has taken. It cannot be kept secret if one wants others to pray for it. 

*41 Let us lift up our hearts and hands*
*to God in heaven:* 
*42 “We have transgressed and rebelled,*
*and you have not ::forgiven::.* #todo/opzoeken zelfde woord in het Hebreeuws als in andere teksten?

We people should always forgive, whether someone has asked for forgiveness or not, because unforgiveness will eat us up from the inside. God can choose not to forgive something, perhaps because He will not suffer from it. 
In this case it would be logical if God has not forgiven the people, because they had not even asked for forgiveness. This would explain the next verses about God's wrath and vengeance to His people. All was done to get them to ask forgiveness and Jeremiah reminds them of that before it is too late. However, it could also be that there are two different words for forgiveness in Hebrew, one indicating the forgiveness one should have in his heart, while the other indicates the retraction of the punishment. Just like a father is angry with his child, but will forgive him for its mistakes and not hold a grudge against him, yet he will still punish the child not only for what he has done, but also to prevent it from happening another time by teaching him what the consequences are and instilling fear in the child.

*43 “You have wrapped yourself with anger and pursued us,*
*killing ::without pity::;*

Verse 43 is not contradictory with verse 33. God can grief about those He killed, yet at the same time He kills without pity. To pity someone is to empathize with a person's feelings for being in a bad situation. However, in this case these people are in a bad situation due to their own fault. God does not empathize with them for being punished, because it is what they deserves. 
I think that if God Himself were to be punished justly for what He had done wrong, He would not want the punishment to be taken away. Neither would He want to have any pity from others, because it would be well deserved. In the same way God does not pity those who deserve their punishment, but He does grieve the mistakes they made and the lives that are gone now. 

*44 ::you have wrapped yourself with a cloud*::
::*so that no prayer can pass through.*::

#biblestudy/questions Does this mean that God does not accept prayers at certain moments? 
There are certain moments when our prayer is hindered when we are in transgression. If we cannot speak to God openly about our mistakes, being truly repentant, God will not hear our prayers. God cannot be fooled. True repentance requires true action. 1 Peter 3:7 says that the prayers of men will be hindered when they do not show honor to their wives. How could God accept prayer from a man who does not do so? He does not. 
In the same way, before these people lifted up their hands their prayers did not pass through this cloud, because their prayers were not genuine. Now Jeremiah is calling on them to be truly repentant.

*45 You have made us scum and garbage*
*among the peoples.*

The Israelites have indeed become scum and garbage among the peoples. It is often noticed by Jews and Christians especially that Israel gets an especially harsh treatment and a disproportionate amount of attention and condemning from the United Nations for its deeds #todo/opzoeken/engels against the Palestinian people—most of which are not even true in my belief. #tags/country/israel 
Christians claim then that it is the devil who wants to attack the children of God, hence the many attacks on Christians and Jews all around the world and in all ages. That much is true, but it also true that Jews have brought it upon themselves (and Christians too, for example by staying in one place instead of going out, so that God had to find a way to push them across borders, but that is out of the scope here). 
In verse 45 we read that it is God Who did this to the Jews and the reasons for it in are in the verses before. The question the Jews should ask themselves is: Have they truly tested and examined their ways as in verse 40? In part, perhaps, yes, which is why they were released from Persia, but perhaps the generations afterwards turned their way against God again. 
Even if the generations of the exile in Persia and thereafter behaved similarly "well" and could have been accepted as examining oneself, repentance and not rejecting God might still be a rejection of God during or after the life of Jesus. Those who have heard about Jesus—and especially those who have known or seen Him during His life—bear greater responsibility (cf. Luke 12:48). 
Some Jews, unfortunately not all, such as orthodox Jews, still aim for a moral life in honor of God, but still without recognition for His Son, Jesus Christ. As long as they do not recognize the Son of God, the Father will chastise them. This seems like a high bar, but it is unimaginable for a person from a hot climate if you recognize him but not his son. If one wants to be friends with another person, he expects you to treat his wife with the same courtesy and his children as well, how much more then would God expect this from us?

*46 “All our enemies*
*open their mouths against us;*
*47 panic and pitfall have come upon us,*
*devastation and destruction;*

The devastation that has become the Jews has been more than just destruction indeed. It has been the death of many Israelites, the destruction of many cities and buildings, including the Holy Temple, but also the reputation and denigration and discrimination of the Jewish people. 
Though their reputation should be good, because of their academics and economic achievements, mostly bad things are said about them, such as being cheap or fraudulent in their business. 

*48 my eyes flow with rivers of tears*
*because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.*

Jeremiah changes here from the plural to the singular first person perspective. His grieve is over the Israelites. Of course the Israelites themselves are grieving too, but about themselves. They do not see their fault in all of this, they do not even see the grievance in God, but Jeremiah does and on behalf of God he is suffering to show but a glimpse of what God is really feeling. He even calls the Israelites "the daughter of my people". Now this term has been used by many people, such as Moses ("let my people go", see Exodus) and even native American Pocahontas (at least in the Disney depiction #tags/movies) but both were leaders in a sense, but here and in verse 51 it sounds as if Jeremiah is above the people, even though he is *not* an official leader. He speaks as if the people of Jerusalem are his own. 

*49 “My eyes will flow without ceasing,*
*without respite,*
*50 until the LORD from heaven*
*looks down and sees;*
*51 my eyes cause me grief*
*at the fate of all the daughters of my city.*
*52 “I have been hunted like a bird*
*by those who were my enemies without cause;*
*53 they flung me alive into the pit*
*and cast stones on me;*

*54 water closed over my head;*
*I said, I am lost.’*
*55 “I called on your name, O LORD,*
*from the depths of the pit;*
*56 ::you heard my plea, ‘Do not close*::
::*your ear to my cry for help!’*::
*57 You came near when I called on you;*
*you said, Do not fear!’*
*58 “You have taken up my cause, O Lord;*
*you have redeemed my life.*
*59 You have seen the wrong done to me, O LORD;*
*judge my cause.*

Here Jeremiah claims that the wrong done to him was done by his enemies, people that is, but in v.4ee he claims it is God Who made him bitter etc. #biblestudy/questions

*60 You have seen all their vengeance,*
*all their plots against me.*
*61 “You have heard their taunts, O LORD,*
*all their plots against me.*
*62 The lips and thoughts of my assailants*
*are against me all the day long.*
*63 Behold their sitting and their rising;*
*I am the object of their taunts.*
*64 “You will repay them, O LORD,*
*according to the work of their hands.*

On the one hand Jeremiah wants God to repay the people what they have done, but on the other hand he is asking the people to lift up their hands and repent (v.41) so that the punishment will stop. 

*65 You will give them dullness of heart;*
*your curse will be on them.*
*66 You will pursue them in anger and destroy them*
*from under your heavens, O LORD.”*

The punishment that Jeremiah asks of God as retribution for his enemies is that they will be repaid according to the work of their hands, first of all, and secondly dullness of heart. He is asking for a just punishment, no more than they deserve, defined by what they have done. The form of the punishment, Jeremiah asks to be dullness of heart, that is a heart that cannot hear or feel the Lord anymore. Not only will that lead to ultimate destruction, as man is doomed to destroy his kind and himself as well when he does not have God, but perhaps to Jeremiah the ultimate punishment is not knowing God and his mercy. #church/material
