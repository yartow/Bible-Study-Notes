# 20171004 The shaping of God
#biblestudy/devotionals

Man shows its art in shaping the ends of things. The next door neighbor does that by shaping the top of his hedges or his buxi. 
People who work on people in artistic forms, such as hairdressers, shape the tips of people's hairs. 
People who work with people in companies, build buildings and scrape the sky, but do not shape the sky. 
But the clouds, that are too high for men to reach, are shaped by God. 
Also the oceans, that are too deep for men to sink to, and too dark to see, are shaped by God. 

Not only that, everything in between the skies and the bottom of the oceans is shaped by God. From the tiniest thing, such as grass tips, to the greatest mountains and valleys.

Even more so everything outside of the highest skies are shaped by God as well. Every star and planet. Every moon of every planet.
Every solar system and galaxy. 
Everything visible and invisible. So even the black holes and all the forces around it.
