# 2 Corinthians 1 (ESV) 
***Greeting***
*1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,*
*To the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:*
*2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.*

***God of All Comfort***
*3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, 4 who comforts us in all our ::affliction, so that:: we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves ::are:: comforted by God.* #biblestudy/memorization/todo 

We should not forget that in the first place we are comforted by God. The goal of our suffering is so that we may give Him glory. In Paul's case it was to humble him (see 2 Corinthians 12:7), but there are many other reasons possible. Thus when Paul is humbled he becomes more like Christ, and anyone who suffers can become more like Christ and in this way give God glory or show God's glory to others.
Even though this is the goal of suffering, it does not mean that God created suffering, for from good nothing that is bad can be created. 

Also note that the present tense "are" is being used here, indicating that God *still* is comforting us.

*5 For as we share abundantly in Christ's sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too. 6 If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer.*

Both the comfort and the suffering we experience are for the benefit of others. The more afflications we experience, the more comfort we can provide to a multitude of afflications of others. This is another reason why Paul rejoices in his sufferings (for example in Romans 5:3). Yet another reason is given below in v.9, i.e. to rely on God.  
Of course it is not necessary for someone to have experienced the same afflication before he can pastor another, but it does help.

*7 Our hope for you is unshaken, for we know that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in our comfort.*

Paul wants the Corinthians to know that if they will share the same sufferings as Paul did, they do not have to be afraid or lose hope, for they will also share the same comfort that Paul enjoyed from God. 

*8 For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the affliction we experienced in Asia. For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself. 9 Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But that was to make us rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead.*

Keeping in mind that there was another letter written between 1 Corinthians and this one, and that Paul had even paid them an unsuccesful visit where he was accused of several things (#todo/opzoeken ) and disappointed in the Corinthians for not standing up against these false teachers, for him who planted (perhaps) but at least helped build up the church and who is the apostle of their Lord Jesus Christ (see *MacSBNnkjv* for more background information), what would be the purpose of writing do1wn this emotional expression of his hardships. Of course in the first place it is to the glory of God, somewhat as a continuation of v.7 so that the Corinthians will retrain their hope. But in the second place, there might be a call here from Paul to wake them up from their #todo/opzoeken/engels roes and to stand up against the false teachers, expel them and accept Paul's techings on the Word of Christ. Paul is not looking for pity and he is not playing in #todo/opzoeken/engels on their emotions for that would contrast his style. Paul's style has always been a combination of rational arguments and an awe for the work of Christ. If there is any emotion, it is for Christ. Paul does always write a few emotional parts in his letters, about how he misses them and how he always keeps them in his prayers, but not with the intention to stir up their emotions so as to compel them to take action, for those need to be done from a change of heart, which can only be done by the Holy Spirit, not by an emotional #todo/opzoeken/engels ... . 
So what is the reason then for writing this? Perhaps it is more a question of my own, for I would think that the Corinthians would not be interested in hearing this from Paul. If the Corinthians were so cold-hearted that they even ignored Paul's teachings in his first letter and did not welcome him and treat him in the way they should a person who travelled hundreds of miles to see you, and thousands in total, would they then listen to another one of his letters? Probably not. But an emotional address such as this one might change their feelings towards him. But as I just mentioned, that would not be correct, so therefore I should not see this part as such. 

*10 He delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he ::will:: deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will deliver us ::again::.*

Apparently God had already delivered Paul before. Perhaps Paul refers to the events in Asia in v.8, but it could also be the other events he encountered on his way such as the multiple shipwrecks on the sea and the beatings he received while in and out of prison (#todo/opzoeken Handelingen). 

*11 You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many.*

In this verse "many" is mentioned twice. Here Paul asks the Corinthians to pray for him, just like many others have done (the latter "many"), and which granted the blessings that Paul and his fellow workers have received, among which deliverance from the deadly peril. But Paul also wants many (the first "many") people to give thanks to God, because God heard the prayers of the first group. 
So in other words, Paul is asking people to pray for him with supplication and then, when the blessing has been granted, he asks people to thank God on behalf of him. This alone is different from what most Christians do—if I may speak so freely, for I may be wrong about the "most"-part—for we ask God and ask others for a certain need, and then when God has provided we often forget to thank Him and more often forget to tell others what God has done in our life. But Paul goes even further, for he asks the Corinthians to pray for the *purpose* that many will give thanks to God. In other words, Paul's purpose is that people will see the glory of God. 

***Paul's Change of Plans***
*12 For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience, that we behaved in the world with simplicity and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and supremely so toward you. 13 For we are not writing to you anything other than what you read and understand and I hope you will fully understand— 14 just as you did ::partially:: understand us—that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you.*
*15 Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a second experience of grace. 16 I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on my way to Judea.*



*17 Was I ::vacillating:: when I wanted to do this? Do I make my plans according to the flesh, ready to say “Yes, yes” and “No, no” at the same time? 18 As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No. 19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not Yes and No, but in him it is always Yes. 20 For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory. 21 And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, 22 and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a ::guarantee::.*



*23 But I call God to witness against me—it was to spare you that I refrained from coming again to Corinth. 24 Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith.*
