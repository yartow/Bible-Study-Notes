Why we should witness:
1. because God loves us
2. because it brings joy to the Lord our God

## The mission of Jesus: Lesson 1. Jezus binds the evil one
Volume 14
Everything in the Bible is part of one greater story. 

They like Him, have to be ready to leave their comfortable situation
and enter their broken world

Jesus' teaching was different from entering this world. 

Capernaum, home of the great scholars: Biblically literate and best teachers. Jesus came here on purpose. 

How much is this community, a community of the Word. 
It is not how Jesus authenticates the Bible, it is the other way around. The Bible authenticates Jesus. 

There is not a single teaching of Jesus that does not come from the Bible. 

For example, come to Me... and I will give you rest. The Lord YHWH said that too to Moses. It is a confirmation of Who He is. 

More determined to be faithful than during the time of Jesus. 
To let the king reign
to be reminded to obey

We have to obey otherwise we will display God incorrectly. 

But there was a pendulum where people were too extreme in either of two directions. 

Decapolis, heathen city. To the Jews, it was everything we should not be. Adultery, pagan, ... 

No food, no mention of that city's name. They wanted to be set apart. 
But Jesus said (pointing that way): "That is your mission."
Peter said: "Our Jewish law does not permit us Jews to enter your house or ... "
Matthew 12, Jesus drives out a demon. 
* There were others driving out. By whom were they driving out demons?
* Satan is divided against himself and his kingdom will not stand. 
Two kingdoms, two kings, one of the two kings is your king. There is no third one. 
You can't steal the strong man's stuff, unless you first bind the strongman. 
What is the possession of the strong man? The man out of whom the demon was driven. So Jesus had already bound the devil. 

No where was that evil more real than in Decapolis. 

Jesus' disciples set out to Decapolis, because Jesus told them to. 
Did the other king, the devil, see them coming? Perhaps, that is why he stirred up the storm. 
*Who is this man? Even the wind and storms obey Him.*

Another time the disciples were in a storm, on the water. Jesus stills the storm. 
*Surely this man is the Son of God.*
Why such a reaction on the stilling of the storm and not to the feeding of the 5000? 

Job 9. ... walks on the waves of the sea
The storms and sea are metaphors of chaos. 
Both fall asleep, both cases the sailors awaken them with the same words. 

## Questions
1. We should go out and be a light. Is it not the fake Christians who undermine our best efforts? So there is no difference anymore when we say we are Christians. 
Sam: perhaps it is because the gospel is explained in the wrong way, only about love and not about the law. 
Andrew: in short, two reasons for this church: 
	1. low threshold, very welcoming 
	2. better growth, healthier Christians through more holiness.
But what about churches like Willow Creek and Saddleback. Why are they so successful? 
Bo: What is holiness according to you?
Sam: We should be attractive and include people, including people and then changing people. The focus is not certain things we believe or rules, but God. 
Brynne: showing others the better way is when we show our own brokenness.
1. Should every church be intercultural?
