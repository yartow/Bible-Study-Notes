# Isaiah 9
**Isaiah 9 (NIV)**  
*1 Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those who were in distress. In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the nations, by the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan—*

The states or provinces of Zebulun and Naphtali, which is Galilee, were the first ones to be destroyed by Assyria, and though they will be honored by Jesus' visit and continued presence during the beginning of His ministry, they are not honored because of their good deeds. Rather yet, they were punished first because they were part of the northern tribes, who disobeyed God even more than the southern tribes. So the only reason for receiving this honor is God's grace. Not as a retribution for the fact that they were attacked first during the Assyrian captivity, because that was what they deserved, but purely because of God's choice to let Jesus spend His time there. 

*2 The people walking in darkness*
*have seen a great light;*
*on those living in the land of deep darkness*
*a light has dawned.*

It took a miracle from heaven—though not literally from heaven as in "the sky", it was a literal *miracle* from Heaven, where God is—for the people to see the light. This is strange for us to understand when we put it in terms of actual physical light, for anyone with eyes can see light, *especially* when they are in the darkness. 
One cannot say that he is so used to the dark that he cannot see the light anymore. Rather yet, he would see the light even more clearly, perhaps even as so bright that his eyes cannot stand it. 
Both statements, however, were true of the pharisees and Jesus' presence on Earth. 

Some people could not see it, because they in fact were blind. They live in the dark and know this world best. They do not want to admit that there is a world outside that of the dark world, and how could they understand, for they are blind. That is why they do not understand Jesus' teachings and parables. And that is why they do not see His miracles as godly and His presence as from Heaven.
Then there are those who cannot stand the brightness of the light that Jesus shines with. It hurts their eyes, also because they have accepted that life is dark and because they see the advantages of this darkness. 
In this darkness they can sin, for others will not see it. Moreover, he cannot see his own sins even if they were in front of him, so dark is it.
And now that the light has shone he sees how dirty and messy his life is and how much he has to clean up. This does not attract him and he makes a moral choice to ignore whatever he sees. For he is thinking, as long as some people have not seen the light, I can still lead them and teach them about the truth. Which is a truth that benefits him especially. For it is a truth where one is saved when he has simply made a path to walk on. But he does not see what junk there is on the *side* of this path which is also a prerequisite to clean up before one is allowed to enter heaven. 

*3 You have enlarged the nation*
*and increased their joy;*
*they rejoice before you*
*as people rejoice at the harvest,*
*as warriors rejoice*
*when dividing the plunder.*

I cannot wait until this moment comes, the day that the Lord will come again and that—unfortunately—a part of this world will rise and rejoice, for the other part will see Jesus in awe but at the same time realize they are too late. 

*4 For as in the day of Midian’s defeat,*
*you have shattered*
*the yoke that burdens them,*
*the bar across their shoulders,*
*the rod of their oppressor.*
*5 Every warrior’s boot used in battle*
*and every garment rolled in blood*
*will be destined for burning,*
*will be fuel for the fire.*

You have not only removed the yoke, Lord, You have shattered it so it can never be placed on our shoulders anymore. The devil may try to bluff and threat to put it back, and some of us may fall for it. The devil will say something like, *if you do not do this, I will put this yoke back on you.* *You should feel ashamed for the sins you have committed, go and compensate for that by working extra hard, study till you can see no more at night, and then deprive yourself of your sleep by waking up early to pray and confess all of your sins.*
But by now, we should know that there is no yoke that the devil can bring back upon your shoulders. It is all a bluff. The devil **cannot** undo what God has done. If we have been saved, the devil throw us in jail anymore, for the price has been paid. God has created marriage and when two people are bound together, even if they divorce due to their own desires or because they listen to those of the Satan—which ultimately leads back to our own desires, for why else would we listen to him? Cf. James 1:13-16—then still the bond is not destroyed. The people can marry or have sex with as many people as they like, but that first marriage is still not broken until death has occurred in either party. 

*6 For to us a child is born,*
*to us a son is given,*
*and the government will be on his shoulders.*
*And he will be called*
*Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,*
*Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.*
*7 Of the greatness of his government and peace*
*there will be no end.*
*He will reign on David’s throne*
*and over his kingdom,*
*establishing and upholding it*
*with justice and righteousness*
*from that time on and forever.*
*The zeal of the Lord Almighty*
*will accomplish this.*

The world will be so beautiful when Jesus reigns. Even now when I hear of the small victories of the Republican party I am excited because, how marginally though that may be, it increases the freedom for the America people leading to a slightly more godly life. How wonderful would it not be then if the whole law and constitution and the whole world were on Jesus' shoulders, and every law came straight from His mouth, and every case in court, if there were any, would be ruled in an instance and always according on perfectly Biblical grounds?
This is why I love Psalm 119:96 so much when David says 
> How wonderful are the commands in Your Law. I meditate on it all day long.  

I see no hardship in the following of this Law, neither do I have any objections to the — according to this world *severe* — punishments. I merely see the good part of this Law, because if everybody abides by it, the poor will be fed, there will be no hunger and unrighteousness. There will be far less sick people and perhaps even insurances are not needed. 
There will be trust and social capital, because  there will be no corruption. 
What about rights for gays and pregnant teenagers? Again, if there is righteousness because everyone will follow the Law, as far as human righteousness goes of course, as opposed to God's perfect righteousness, then there is no argument for teenage mothers not being able to go to college or not have enough income, because the society and church will take care of them. Gays would not have communities or unions to protect them because there is no one who attacks them. 
As for gay marriages, if no sexual is committed against children, and if everything family is healthy then there *might* not be any gays. But if this theory is wrong, society would be aware of the dangers of sex before marriage and both heterosexuals and gays would stay pure before marriage. 

**The Lord’s Anger Against Israel**
*8 The Lord has sent a message against Jacob;*
*it will fall on Israel.*
*9 All the people will know it—*
*Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria —*
*who say with pride*
*and arrogance of heart,*
*10 “The bricks have fallen down,*
*but we will rebuild with dressed stone;*
*the fig trees have been felled,*
*but we will replace them with cedars. ”*

The people of Israel were not devastated when they saw their city falling apart, because they still had hope. Not faith in God, but faith in themselves. They had the money, probably, and the materials to build it up again. They did not need God for this. 
How often are we not the same as they are, relentless in putting our hope in the Lord, willing to do everything except relying on the Lord, trying to fix it as long as it is within our own powers? The problem with this thought of "our own powers" is that we do not have any powers, we only think we have. For where do our talents and gifts come from? From God alone. What has brought us to this place where we could learn so many skills?
Moreover, what upholds the universe? God's power alone, for without it everything would collapse. The same goes for every cell in our bodies. The people who really understand cell biology know that cells are more complex than the structures of a whole city. And what is upholding every single cell? *God* is the answer. 
What is it that gives our every breath? Him alone. Without God's permission we would not take a single breath.
Thank You, Lord, for upholding every second of my life and thank You for every second that I still get to live, for it is only by Your mercy that I can do anything at all.

*11 But the Lord has strengthened Rezin’s foes against them*
*and has spurred their enemies on.*
*12 Arameans from the east and Philistines from the west*
*have devoured Israel with open mouth.*
*Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away,*
*his hand is still upraised.*

The Lord has not put His hand over His people this time, because they would not listen nor follow Him. Not only is He allowing His people's enemies to attack them, but He is even strengthening them and spurring them on. And after that has happened, God is still not satisfied with the destruction that has been done to northern Israel. 
And rightfully so, for we see in the next verses that Israel still not has a change of heart. Israel really needs to lose something valuable, something that is critical to their survival. Only when that is removed, Israel can break, not only the country, but their hearts and bad habits and traits as well. 

*13 But the people have not returned to him who struck them,*
*nor have they sought the Lord Almighty.*
*14 So the Lord will cut off from Israel both head and tail,*
*both palm branch and reed in a single day;*
*15 the elders and dignitaries are the head,*
*the prophets who teach lies are the tail.*
*16 Those who guide this people mislead them,*
*and those who are guided are led astray.*

In this case the thing that makes them survive is like a cancer. No matter how much chemo or radiation is used on it, it cannot die. No matter how many innocent casualties #todo/opzoeken  there are due to the destruction of the cancer, this cancer will still not die, unless it is cut out of the people. 
These cancers are the false prophets, the elders and the dignitaries. They are spread throughout the Jewish societies and influence the people in different fields. Again, I must refer to the American society for examples because it is so well reflected and because I believe this is a prophecy speaking of the United States in this age, among others.
The prophets are the megaphones of their beliefs. To them, God or another god, is what believe in and what they live for. If it is not god, it is actually themselves, so they see theirselves as their god, for all they want is to serve themselves. Take for example temple prostitution where one could grow more crops by sacrificing a cow and then have sex with one of the prostitutes. That hardly seems like an offer and choosing this religion is highly motivated by their own pleasures. 
So the people are only living for themselves, that is their belief, in themselves. The false prophets tell them what they want to hear and they feel they are confirmed in their only beliefs. The truth, however, is that the Satan already knows what is in the hearts of people, and sends these false prophets to proclaim this. 

The elders, dignitaries and the prophets were of course working together. The prophets taught the Jewish people what was right and the elders punished any deviation thereof on the basis of this teaching. 

In the United States it is no different. The elders are the leading people, they are the people in the government and in politics. The dignitaries are those the people look up to and provide popular examples, in this case through Hollywood and other media. I am not sure if there was any form of news, but if there were, these must have been severely constricted by the elders and teachers as well. The prophets who were teaching are those in education. 
Indeed the teachers are acting like prophets, for they speak as if they have greater authority than others, greater than science and greater than other persons. They will decide what is morally right, and they have decided it is morally not right to deny gay couples a wedding. They have decided that people of all ages can say what their gender should be and should get gender-change operations.
It is no coincidence that Dinesh D'Souza, who is a Christian, wrote in his book *Stealing America*, that the Left controls these megaphones. These megaphones have existed throughout history and have caused the demise of the Israelites. 
If all three megaphones, media (news and Hollywood), politics and education, are in the hands of one, say, philosophy, then the people will follow that philosophy. We cannot let this happen! 
In the Netherlands politics is half-way taken by the Left, media and education are almost completely taken away. In the United States, fortunately a big part of the politics have been regained, by gaining Congress (the House and the Senate), which probably means there is a majority of Republicans in it, the White House and the addition of a Republican Justice. But they are losing heavily on the media and education. Perhaps they are still better off than the Netherlands, because there are still private universities, Christian universities and community colleges, as well as homeschooling. The number of conservative media seems to be rising as well, with YouTube-channels and official news-channels such as the *Daily Wire, Louder with Crowder, Breitbart, PragerU* and *the Tipping Point* gaining an increasing influence. Unfortunately, news-channels on the left might be increasing as well. *The Young Turks* is just one of those, but almost all television channels, NBC, MSNBC, etc. are all left, even CNN, though they do not admit it. Only Fox is not, but it is constantly ridiculed and not taken seriously by the left.

*17 Therefore the Lord will take no pleasure in the young men,*
*nor will he pity the fatherless and widows,*
*for everyone is ungodly and wicked,*
*every mouth speaks folly.*
*Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away,*
*his hand is still upraised.*

The Lord has always cared about the young men. In the Sinai desert he let all the men of age die, but he let the young men live. God has always had respect (if I may say so) for the poor and commanded His people to respect them as well, but now He will not pity anyone anymore. For everyone is guilty of treason to God through their worship of idols. 
Even the destruction of the "innocent" in the eyes of the world, the sick, poor and widows, even the children, will not turn God's anger away. And He is right in doing so. 
Why do I say so? First of all, because He is God and He is sovereign. If He does it, it *is* right by definition. Second of all, he knows the heart of all people. The poor may be innocent in some ways, but they are just as guilty as others for following idols. 

*18 Surely wickedness burns like a fire;*
*it consumes briers and thorns,*
*it sets the forest thickets ablaze,*
*so that it rolls upward in a column of smoke.*
*19 By the wrath of the Lord Almighty*
*the land will be scorched*
*and the people will be fuel for the fire;*
*they will not spare one another.*

I think Isaiah is talking in analogies here, but they are literal as well. It is true that wickedness burns *like* a fire, so it does not actually burn things, but it is contagious in that sense that everyone around the wicked person is sucked up into it and inclined to be wicked as well. Especially because wickedness leads to fame and fortune in a relatively short period and deep inside, all people want that. 
But there is truth in that the land of Israel burned, probably set by the Assyrians. The people were not literally fuel for fire, but they were the fuel for the fire (and rage) of God. 
What is interesting is that Isaiah says "*they will not spare each other*". It is they themselves who do not spare each other. They kill each other, even without God's intervention—if I may say so. 

*20 On the right they will devour,*
*but still be hungry;*
*on the left they will eat,*
*but not be satisfied.*
*Each will feed on the flesh of their own offspring:*
*21 Manasseh will feed on Ephraim, and Ephraim on Manasseh;*
*together they will turn against Judah.*
*Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away,*
*his hand is still upraised.*

And they will not only kill, but eat each other as well due to their hunger. Their hunger will be greater than their love for their fellowmen, their fellow Israelites and even their own offspring.
