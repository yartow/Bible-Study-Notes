# Isaiah 21 (NIV) 
**A Prophecy Against Babylon**
*1 A prophecy against the Desert by the Sea:*
*Like whirlwinds sweeping through the southland,*
*an invader comes from the desert,*
*from a land of terror.*

The invader of Babylon came out of the desert. Now Babylon is surrounded by desert (as far as I know), so this would be no surprise. On the other hand, if all is desert around you, it is easy to spot to an upcoming army. Spotting it in time, however, would give you perhaps a few days of preparation time and getting things set. This would only be enough if they had already been prepared of course. These last days would then be an emotional preparation, by saying goodbyes to family—if such things were ever done in these days and in these cultures.
The enemy would be either coming from a surrounding country or from a further country. I suppose surrounding countries would give a warning. At least tensions or signs would be noticeable beforehand. But in the case a country further away were the invader of Babylon, would this invader not attack countries on the road, for food and supplies? Or would it not even at least buy food and supply? And in doing either one of these, would this country that provides supply to the invader not send a message to Babylon for help in the former case, or a warning in the latter case? 
Perhaps so, but Babylon was still invaded. Whatever measures she prepared, not matter how big her army was, she could still not prevent being invaded. 
Babylon, as a city, was of course part of its own kingdom of Babylon and was conquered by Assyria, and a thousand years before that perhaps by many other invaders. So Babylon was far from unapproachable. But after the Babylonian war she might have gained a reputation and such pride that she *thought* she was, now with an empire greater than the Assyrians and in that sense a bigger army. 
I doubt whether the army became strong, because the army would have to be spread among a greater area. In order to keep the same strength, it needed to gain in size. But where would these soldiers come from? Most men were probably killed and how many men from invaded countries would be willing to fight for the invader of their home country?

*2 A dire vision has been shown to me:*
*The traitor betrays, the looter takes loot.*
*Elam, attack! Media, lay siege!*
*I will bring to an end all the groaning she caused.*

We have now moved forward in time. I am not sure whether the prophecies concerning the invasion of Cush and Egypt were referring to the Assyrian or the Babylonian army, but the invader of Babylon is first of all referring to the invasion of the Babylonian Empire, and not the city of Babylon, and second of all, it is referring to an army that chronologically came after the Babylonian Empire, which is the empire of the Medes and Persians. This verse verse proves this. 

*3 At this my body is racked with pain,*
*pangs seize me, like those of a woman in labor;*
*I am staggered by what I hear,*
*I am bewildered by what I see.*
*4 My heart falters,*
*fear makes me tremble;*
*the twilight I longed for*
*has become a horror to me.*

The prophet is in pain, but it is the pain God feels for the many people that are going to die. God knows what is coming. Even now the people are already ignoring His warnings and instead they are still feasting and celebrating their imaginative freedom. This hurts God as well. 
I do not know what Isaiah means with "twilight", but it could be that little bit of light that could save Judah. There was almost no hope in the near future for Judah's salvation except that Babylon was defeated by another country. That was the only spark of light, or *twilight*, I think, the Israelites had. 
But this twilight will turn out to be devastating, though Isaiah could already see what was coming. The horrors the Persians and Medes would go through to kill their enemy, the Babylonians, and conquer the land. Also, the Israelites who were already living in the Babylonian exile would perhaps not be better off than before. Daniel perhaps, stayed in somewhat the same position within the empire (or kingdom), but what happened with the others? And what about the Jews in the time of Esther? They were about to be persecuted, but something must have led to that. There must have been some kind of hatred already or small scale persecution. #todo/opzoeken  Persians more cruel than Assyrians and Babylonians? What language did the Persians speak? 

*5 They set the tables,*
*they spread the rugs,*
*they eat, they drink!*
*Get up, you officers,*
*oil the shields!*

In the midst of eating Darius and his the officials were disturbed by an attack of the Persians. It was an actual attack, and not a messenger briefing them with news of an oncoming enemy, for Darius was killed that same night. 
I do not know how it is possible for an army to travel at least 50 kilometers (assuming that is the viewing range a lookout tower has) in one night (assuming that the lookout cannot see in the dark). One possibility is that it was not an army that infiltrated Babylon, but a small group of soldiers, which are less noticeable from such a distance, or men (and women) dressed up as merchants and unnoticeably entered the city gates. 
Another explanation is that the war was already going on or the enemy was already in sight, but Darius still held a banquet because in his pride he thought this enemy would never win. The same pride caused his downfall, first because God let hem go, He would not use Darius as His tool to take care of the Jews anymore; second, because the Persians would (perhaps literally) take his head that night. 

*6 This is what the Lord says to me:*
*“Go, post a lookout*
*and have him report what he sees.*
*7 When he sees chariots*
*with teams of horses,*
*riders on donkeys*
*or riders on camels,*
*let him be alert,*
*fully alert.”*
*8 And the lookout shouted,*
*“Day after day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower;*
*every night I stay at my post.*
*9 Look, here comes a man in a chariot*
*with a team of horses.*
*And he gives back the answer:*
*‘Babylon has fallen, has fallen!*
*All the images of its gods*
*lie shattered on the ground!’”*

Apparently this lookout is posted not in Babylon. This prophecy is about the future, in the time that Babylon has fallen, the city or the empire. So where could this lookout then be placed? Perhaps it was placed in Judah. Although only few Jews were left in the Holy Land, they still hoped for relief and a destruction of Babylon.

*10 My people who are crushed on the threshing floor,*
*I tell you what I have heard*
*from the Lord Almighty,*
*from the God of Israel.*

The Jews were probably used as slaves or at least in hard physical and agricultural labor and they were crushed by the harsh treatment of the Babylonian invaders. 
This hope that Isaiah gave them was not a human hope filled with uncertainty, but Isaiah mentions here clearly, it is something he heard from the Lord Almighty Himself, Who is the God is Israel!

**A Prophecy Against Edom**
*11 A prophecy against Dumah:*
*Someone calls to me from Seir,*
*“Watchman, what is left of the night?*
*Watchman, what is left of the night?”*
*12 The watchman replies,*
*“Morning is coming, but also the night.*
*If you would ask, then ask;*
*and come back yet again.”*

[see Evernote]
Why did the person ask the same question twice? Did the watchman not hear well? 
I think he doubted as what to answer, because there were two answers. The first one would be a literal answer, as in how many hours were left of the night. The second answer would be more hesitantly given, for it is perhaps the last time one can answer this question. 
Surely, as a watchman he could see what was coming and warn the city (or country) of a coming attack. But it is just like with seeing a tsunami heading in your direction. There is nothing that can be done to stop it.
Yet he comes, although these are God's words, with these beautiful words in verse 12. In the movie *2012* people are shown, full of peace even though they know their end is coming and some see the beauty in it. 

But there is another meaning for this watchman's poetic reply.
*“Morning is coming, but also the night.* 
This could mean: "Literally, the morning is coming, but figuratively, it will be period like night." Or it could mean: "Figuratively, the morning is coming (that is, a relief from the ongoing Assyrian invasion, and figuratively, another period will come like night, which is the Babylonian invasion."
They have not even noticed the coming of Persia. 

**A Prophecy Against Arabia**
*13 A prophecy against Arabia:*
*You caravans of Dedanites,*
*who camp in the thickets of Arabia,*
*14 bring water for the thirsty;*
*you who live in Tema,*
*bring food for the fugitives.*
*15 They flee from the sword,*
*from the drawn sword,*
*from the bent bow*
*and from the heat of battle.*

Even Arabia, which would be Saudi-Arabia and Iraq, I think, though no invasion of the Assyrians occurred, is allowed to play a role in the events of world invasion by aiding the fugitives with water and food.
This is a call to Jews and Christians alike to take in these that are running from persecution, whether Muslims or Christian. This does not answer, however, the question of whether the United States should take in Mexicans, even if they are "good", that is not criminal. 

*16 This is what the Lord says to me: “Within one year, as a servant bound by contract would count it, all the splendor of Kedar will come to an end. 17 The survivors of the archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be few. ” The Lord, the God of Israel, has spoken.*

But this safety that Arabia has from the Assyrians is only temporary. For now they are helping the fugitives, but in due time they will be fugitives themselves.
