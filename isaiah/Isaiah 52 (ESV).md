# Isaiah 52 (ESV) 
**The Lord's Coming Salvation**
*1 Awake, awake,*
*put on your strength, O Zion;*
*put on your beautiful garments,*
*O Jerusalem, the holy city;*
*for there shall no more come into you*
*the uncircumcised and the unclean.*
*2 Shake yourself from the dust and arise;*
*be seated, O Jerusalem;*
*loose the bonds from your neck,*
*O captive daughter of Zion.*

Did God say here "into you" on purpose? He was probably not talking about objects being inserted into the Jews. It seems rather that he is speaking of the heathens, the uncircumcised, that will not join the Israelites anymore. My question then is, why does God write "no more"? They were not used to come into the people of Israel, were they? I might know of some exceptions, such as Ruth the Moabite, Rahab (#todo/opzoeken  what was she?) and Uriah the Hittite, but there most certainly was no standard practice to "baptize" heathens into Jewish culture. 
There were, however, a number of people in the country working for Israel, such as the Gibeonites. #todo/opzoeken I remember, though, that everyone, including those working for you, had to be circumcised. Though they might be unclean, if they did not abide by kosher rules or follow God, but at least were circumcised, so I think this line does not apply to them. #biblestudy/questions

*3 For thus says the Lord: “You were sold for nothing, and you shall be redeemed without money.”*

God did not sell the Israelites (and Judahites), otherwise this would be contradictory with a previous verse in Isaiah, but as a figure of speech these Israelites were sold off to other peoples, or perhaps literally they were captured by the Assyrians and then sold off as slaves, just like Solomon had done with the people he captured (he let them do hard labor without pay). 
But whether figuratively or literally, who got paid when the Israelites were sold? God did not get anything from the defection of the Jews. He gave them all He had, the whole world (not literally, because other peoples had their own countries as well, but at least everything they needed in it, they got), everything in it and even "virtually" or "futuristically" His own life or that of His Son. They left God with nothing. 
Then they got sold and still got nothing for what He had put in them. So logically God is going to take His people back without paying for it. They were His in the first place. 
Compare this with a dog that runs off with for example an expensive necklace you gave him. The dog might run away, and someone might capture him and/or sell him off to another person. Either way, this dog and everything it has, is yours because you paid for it and you should not have to pay anything to get your dog back. Perhaps, in this example, only some fees for the one who gets your dog back to you, such as the police, but in God's case, He does it all by Himself. 
He does not owe anything to anyone. If anything at all, everyone owes God!

*4 For thus says the Lord God: “My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there, and the Assyrian oppressed them for nothing.* 

#biblestudy/questions What does "at *the* first" mean? 

**Side note.** The Israelites went to Egypt about 4000 years ago, only a few years after the flood of Noah. It is striking to see that within only 400 years the three sons of Noah could populate the whole world including cities in Canaan such as Jericho and the whole country and civilization of Egypt including pyramids, which were probably built on the backs of the Jews #todo/opzoeken is the material of the Jews used anywhere in Egypt? 
Unfortunately, this also included gods. God blessed Ham, Japhet and Shem #todo/opzoeken with fertility and intelligence to create the many peoples and structures such as the by humans unbreachable #todo/opzoeken walls of Jericho and the "great" Pyramids, of Gaza for example. By 2000 BC, only 400 years into existence out of "nothing" except the knowledge in Noah's three sons' heads—and I am not sure if they had all the knowledge of the world, no matter how small the world population was, would they have known Jubal for example and learned from him the skills to make musical instruments or to make music, and other skills to work with wood and metal?
Also, out of them was created the people of China who which also was an innovative country with many inventions #todo/opzoeken  which inventions by that time? 
and even now world famous philosophers #todo/opzoeken  which ones? Lao Zi, Confucius? 
Now that is not even the most amazing thing. Whatever God had done was forgotten! That is what strikes me. God created a flood so big one could never forget and it is written in many cultures, and must have been spoken of in *every* culture. Yet, the "invented" new gods, or at least someone did. 
Perhaps a person thought he could make money by creating a religion, or perhaps—which is more likely—the devil disguised himself as Buddha or Brahman #todo/opzoeken when did Hinduism and Buddhism come into place?
or any other god or idol such as Baal and Astarte #todo/opzoeken and he did that simultaneously in every culture around the world, except in the Jewish culture, because God protected them there. 
Does this mean that God did not protect the other peoples? No, by far. It was always known to them that God did all of the miracles and where they came from. They did had not seen it with their own eyes or experienced it themselves, they could trust the testimony of all the previous generations. But when a "ghost" appeared, a so-called god, which was the devil in disguise, telling them that he created the world and that he wanted to be worshipped and—most importantly—that they could get what they wanted, fertility, riches and power, the people chose to believe in Satan rather than God. They preferred a god with human sacrifices than the worship of God Who demanded no such thing and only asked for loving Him and your fellowmen. 
The people were misled by their own greed and desires and Satan used this. He tempted them, that is for sure, but they gave in to their temptations themselves. 
::nog af te maken...:: #todo  In the same way as Adam and Eve were misled and followed their lust. 

This would mean that lust is in all of us, even if we were perfect. It would not be possible for us to turn sinful if there was not a seed of sin in us already. Or as James 5:13 #todo/opzoeken  puts it, we had an evil desires which turned into sin. #todo/opzoeken  "evil" staat er letterlijk in? 
so if something turns into sin, it means it was not sin before. One could also state that the evil desire used to be a normal healthy desire gone out of control. 
The word "control" is key here. As I see it God has given Adam and Eve healthy desires to reproduce, to become smarter and rule the world. Coincidentally these are three things of which for at least one, everyone #todo/opzoeken  or was it all men only?— will eventually fall for: sex, money and power—although money and power are closely related and intelligence or wisdom is not really analogous to money, although it usually leads to it. Another side note is that real intelligence and wisdom leads to insight and knowing that it is all wrong. For example, if someone would be so smart (or wise) that he could understand the whole Bible and every sermon and God's Word for him personally, then he would know what to do with this power and money and immediately follow God. 
But unfortunately wisdom and intellect are limited and more dangerous than not having these in the first place. Solomon was wise, the wisest in the world, but he thought he was so wise that he did not need God anymore. Later on, in his older years, most presumably, when he wrote Ecclesiastes, he found out he needed God after all to have a meaning and purpose for life. Apparently he was not wise enough and needed time to understand this fact of life.
One can only imagine what would have become of his life if he had known this sooner. But my guess is that even if someone else had written this book before him and shown it to him, he still would not have understood it, just like the many young and smart people straying away by walking on the many sexual immoral paths this world offers. 
This is because intelligence has nothing to do with conscience. Technically and theoretically perhaps, yes, but in practice people even do wrong when they *know* it is wrong because they *want* something really bad (as in, they want it badly). #todo/opzoeken grammar

This leads us back to our point and to this part of the verse: 
> *the Assyrian oppressed them for nothing.*   
Why would the Assyrians oppress the Israelites? For what benefit? Surely, the Assyrians did it to show their strength, to quench their thirst for blood, to defy the God of Israel by showing their's was stronger, and of course they got monetary gains and conquering Israel provided wives for their men and perhaps talented and elitarian people for their kingdom as well, as Nebuchadnezzar had done. 
But if it is true what the Assyrian messenger said (in Hebrew, and I am wondering how he would speak Hebrew unless he had lived in Israel for a while #todo/opzoeken  #biblestudy/questions), then it was God Who sent Sennacherib the dream to conquer Israel and win (but not a dream in which he would conquer Jerusalem as well #todo/opzoeken ). 
God provided him nothing, no payment or rewards, just a dream, and my imagination is that—if this is true—Sennacherib purely went for this dream to see if it would come true, regardless of the rewards. 
That is how this verse would be explained. 

*5 Now therefore what have I here,” declares the Lord, “seeing that my people are taken away for nothing? Their rulers wail,” declares the Lord, “and continually all the day my name is despised. 6 Therefore my people shall know my name. Therefore in that day they shall know that it is I who speak; here I am.”*

Now Sennacherib's people got word of this dream and even mentioned that this dream was from the Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel. But still they disgraced Him, they mocked Him—and in doing so contradicted themselves. 
If a powerful man allows you to break into your house, you should know that it is by his grace that you can enter and take whatever you want. But does this mean you can kill the man as well? No, for he is stronger than you. 
Now the Assyrians knew that God was greater than them, He could even control dreams and outcomes of wars (as the messenger mentioned when trying to invade Jerusalem, for by that time they had already conquered most or all of Israel except Jerusalem). But now, in their haughtiness they thought they could defy the Almighty God as well. Where is the logic in that? 
Can anyone ever defeat his creator? Yes, a sentient robot could kill his maker, if he were a man. ::nog af te maken:: but man is not actually a "creator" but rather a constructor. He constructs things from other things which were already made, but that is not *creation*. 
I do not think an actual creator would be able to create something that could destroy him. Such power does it require to create. 

Back to verses 5 and 6, it is exactly because of the disgracing and despising of God's Name. They have not heard God's voice, perhaps even the king has not and only heard an angel's voice proclaiming the word of God. But now, they shall know God's Name and know who it is Who speaks. This is the main reason why God punishes the Assyrians, because of a direct attack on God, which is even worse than a direct attack on Jews, His children. 

*7 How beautiful upon the mountains*
*are the feet of him who brings good news,*
*who publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness,*
*who publishes salvation,*
*who says to Zion, “Your God reigns.”*

###### The feet of the messenger
Those to whom God will proclaim His Name as in verses 5 and 6, will be doomed. Hearing God's Name for the first time is not a bad thing, but not wanting to hear it and not wanting to know God and being forced to know His Name and know Him, that is a bad thing. Either way, everyone will eventually bow down on His knees for God, out of reverence, or forcibly and out of fear. You choose which one you want. 
Jonah brought the news of Gods Name to the Ninevites, #todo/opzoeken  but he was not there to bring good news, not really. Or perhaps it was good news, because it was in fact the same gospel as John the Baptist and Jesus brought to us. It is a message of hope. There will be punishment, unless you repent. Then you will be saved. 
So perhaps these feet in verse 7 refer to Jonah's. It did not bring happiness in the first place, but repentance, but it did bring happiness after those 40 days of mourning #todo/opzoeken , to see that they were not destroyed.

*8 The voice of your watchmen—they lift up their voice;*
*together they sing for joy;*
*for eye to eye they see*
*the return of the Lord to Zion.*

There are watchmen, spiritual ones. Even though these ones are watchmen who watch out for enemies and shout when enemies come to attach the city and sing when it is the return of their king, I believe we have spiritual watchmen on this world to shout for danger. I am not sure who they are, but Steve Cioccolanti seems like one, who can be heard shouting for dangers such as the Democrats and evolutionists, and who "sees" what is coming through prophecies of God. 
Rick Warren would not be one, no matter how good a preacher or teacher he is, because I do not hear him warning us of spiritual matters and who the enemy is. He is not talking about enemies either in political or religious form, or in any other secular form, such as materialism and sexism. 
Ravi Zacharias on the other hand does mention a lot about what is wrong in this world, namely that there is no *truth* anymore and that truth has become *relative*, which he refutes in his book #todo/opzoeken  (which I still have to read). However, I would not consider him a watchman either because he does not explicitly name the enemies, merely the tactics used by the enemy. 
This is not to say they are worth less, for not everyone can be a watchman and not everyone can or should devote all of his sermons and seminars on current-day and end-time prophecies. Only some should do that. 
Another aspect of watchmen is that they see eye to eye with the return of the Lord. They see that the end-time is not near, but that we are already in it. In that sense, the end of the end-times is near and they see Lord's work in it. 

*9 Break forth together into singing,*
*you waste places of Jerusalem,*
*for the Lord has comforted his people;*
*he has redeemed Jerusalem.*

If you have ever seen the waste #todo/opzoeken  scrapyards, vuilnisbelt/ -hoop on which children live in the Philippines and India, not to work there, but actually *live* there, and if you have seen what they do all day long, where they go simply to relieve themselves #todo/opzoeken  een grote boodschap doen
you would say it is impossible for them to break out in singing. Even if you think singing would be a way to kill time an ease out pain, like slaves did on the cotton fields with their blues, and cowboys and gold-diggers did with their banjos, for these children this seems impossible. Where would they get the strength to sing? Would the children in stone mines be allowed to sing? And if they were, would they even be able to hear their own voice in the cacophony of resounding hammers on stone? 
Jerusalem, as far as I know, was no heap of waste, it probably was more in ruins than it was modern day trash, but living there surely would not have led to breaking forth in singing spontaneously. After all, there was no one to work the land. Perhaps the land was not even fertile and perhaps the weather and even climate had changed in these 70 years. God can do a lot things and these are not exceptions if we look at how God caused a drought for three years in Israel #todo/opzoeken only Israel and not Judah? 
with such simplicity.
You would be practically alone on the wastelands—I am not sure how many Babylonians came to Israel after they had invaded it. 
But there would be a time when people would break forth not only into singing, but into singing *together*. 

*10 The Lord has bared his holy arm*
*before the eyes of all the nations,*
*and all the ends of the earth shall see*
*the salvation of our God.*

Oh how great a sight would it be if God bares His holy arm. The strength and masculinity that would come from that would be awesome. I am not even talking about God touching anyone or beating anyone, but merely baring it. God's face is too holy to be seen by anyone, everyone would die just by seeing His face. Seeing God's back while one's eyes are covered by God's eyes would be amazing as well. I am not sure if Moses' face shone due to that as well, but that is about the limit a human being can see, and even then this was only by God's grace that Moses survived it. 
Isaiah saw God or a figure of it and already felt down prostrate, and this was only in a vision. It is like looking at something too bright, on a photograph, and still get blinded. 
In the same way we must interpret God's bare arm, the effect of that. As a matter of fact, we do not even need to speak of God bearing His arm, what is much more dangerous is God thinking a thought, because with one Word or thought or sentence He created one out of six parts of the world—though He could have created the whole world, but He did this in six parts *for us* and to show his poeticism. 

Now God is doing this, perhaps not in six parts, but at least in the part where he bares His arms and where shows salvation. He is like a hero, like the Lone Ranger who showed up at the horizon first, to give people hope. That is why it says "before the *eyes*". And not only Israel will see this but *every nation*, the enemies as well but even those who have nothing to do with it. *Every* nation needs to see how powerful God is, not to boast, but because God wants *everyone* as His child. The view of God's power is supposed to make other nations regret what they have done wrong and it is giving them a change to depart from their ways. Yes, it is a warning as well to show them that what is going to happen to Assyria and Babylon is going to happen to them too if they do not change, but more than that perhaps is the first view, not the second view of the bashing of these so-called powerful nations, but the first view of hope and God's strength, and the third view where everyone can see that the Israelites c.q. the Jews have been salvaged. 

*11 Depart, depart, go out from there;*
*touch no unclean thing;*
*go out from the midst of her; purify yourselves,*
*you who bear the vessels of the Lord.*
*12 For you shall not go out in haste,*
*and you shall not go in flight,*
*for the Lord will go before you,*
*and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.*

To whom is God speaking now? Could it be the people of Israel? I know that they would go out from the land of Judah, but that was in haste and in flight to Babylon, although it could have been slow as well. On the other hand, a lot of Jews could have wanted to escape Nebuchadnezzar and therefore would have fled Israel to the south, i.e. Africa, for example. It could be that God here is saying that they do not need to flee to other countries, because the travel to Babylon will be protected by God, for He would keep them safe there and put Daniel and his friends in control to safeguard the Jews. 
It could also mean that if any Jews were planning on fleeing to some other country, they could do that easily, because God would keep the Babylonians busy with occupying Israel.

Looking back at this whole piece starting from verse 7, I see that from verse 7 God is speaking about the return from Persia. So as for verses 11 and 12, this is about "escaping" from Persia. They did not have to flee, they could do it slowly, because the Persians would not take them back, unlike the Egyptians in the time of Moses. 
They could not walk too slow, however, and become attached to Persia. Unfortunately many Jews did stay and only 50.000 of them returned to Israel. Can you imagine? Moses started with 2 million Israelites around 3500 years ago (1500 BC). 
::[nog af te maken... hoeveel is 50k van 2M? Hoeveel zijn er afgesplitst tijdens de invasie van Assyrians?]:: #todo 
The Israelites are a stubborn people, which has its good sides, but most certainly its bad sides as well. The Israelites, like all people, were too easily attached to their surrounding as well. This too has its good sides and its bad sides. Throughout all ages the Jewish people have relocated from place to place. Even Abraham in his life did not stay in one place, in Ur of the Chaldeans, but moved to Terach and eventually to Canaan. The next generations would be traveling between Egypt and what would Israel with diasporas into Assyria, Babylon and Persia which covered most of the Indo-European world. The Israelites would survive—although I am still not sure whether the diaspora by the Assyrians left the Israelites with their identity—and adapt, either by creating Jewish ghettos where their culture remained, or by blending in, adapting other gods and becoming on of "them", i.e. the culture and people among which they lived. 
I have heard that many of the Jewish people fled to the Middle East and were allowed to stay there as long as they would accept Allah as their God and Mohammed as His prophet (actually it is with a capital "P" but I refrain from writing that as that is meant for the greatest Prophet, Jesus Christ). What did the Jews choose? They chose to stay and adapt, in order to survive. 
Most likely the Israelites had done that in the Assyrian diaspora as well as in the Babylonian and the Persian ones. During the latter two empires they did not have to do blend in, because they had Daniel and later on Esther, though only during the reign of Xerxes (also known as Ahasuerus #todo/opzoeken ) and only while she was his wife, to protect them, albeit with some struggle, like Daniel himself had (during the reign of the first king of Persia, Darius #todo/opzoeken ) and Esther as well. 
This blending in would, however, almost be the Israelites' demise in many cases, starting with the one from Egypt, where they worshipped calves and it was even Aaron who shaped it like that. It is only because they were not accepted by the Egyptians, that they were seen as a separate people. If it had not been for the cruelty of and the exclusion by the Egyptians, most of the Israelites would have married the Egyptians, followed their gods and become like them. If it had not been for Moses being separated for 40 years to forget about what had learned in the first 40 years of his life, he probably would not have been ready to accept what God spoke to him at the burning bush. 
Perhaps that is why in America the churches within the black population tend to grow faster, because of the exclusion by other ethnicities and the harsh circumstances in which they have to live.

**He Was Pierced for Our Transgressions**
*13 Behold, my servant shall act wisely;*
*he shall be high and lifted up,*
*and shall be exalted.*
*14 As many were astonished at you—*
*his appearance was so ::marred::, beyond human ::semblance::,*
*and his form beyond that of the children of mankind—*

What Jesus has done, God here calls that *wise*. Jesus was self sacrificing and died, and God thought that was wise. We should take Jesus' example, or better said, we *must* take Jesus as our example, that is the only way to come closer to God. Eventually that will mean that we will be taking up our cross, that we will be high and lifted up and exalted in God's eyes, but at the same time dying here on Earth. 
It will mean, some day, that our appearance will be so marred with scars from the Kingdom, that the people on Earth will recognize us, Christians, at once when they see one, but also they will be scared to approach us. 
If one sees a person with a marred face, like *Deadpool*'s, would you be afraid to approach him? 
But it is these scars that make one beautiful in the eyes of God. Not that God likes pain or ugliness, but a person with heavenly scars is formed more in character than one without. God takes more pleasure in formed and disciplined characters better than in unformed and undisciplined ones.
God loves to take care of the weak and feeble, because they are willing to open up to God. They already have scars, though for other reasons and heavenly ones, but they know that all of these scars are nothing compared to the love they can get from Christ. 
They also know that new scars will not affect them. Even though these type of people are  sensitive to exclusion, they are very sensitive to *inclusion* as well, and once Jesus Christ has included them, the exclusion by the world because they are Christian does not matter anymore, because they now belong to someone. 

*15 so shall he sprinkle many nations.*
*Kings shall shut their mouths because of him,*
*for that which has not been told them they see,*
*and that which they have not heard they understand.*

Does God mean here by "sprinkling" that he will sprinkle bits of the Messiah around many nations? Does this refer to Christianity where a little bit of the Holy Spirit, though fully at the same time, is in every Christian?
[Cf. MacSBNnkjv 52:15, where the sprinkling is explained. The priests used to sprinkle blood on the altar #todo/opzoeken on which places exactly and for what reason
I think it was to reconcile with God. Perhaps verse 15 is saying that when Jesus has sprinkled His blood across the nations kings will shut their mouths. However, we do not see that yet, unless the kings actually have shut their mouths for a time in the past, and have reopened it again. But I think that what is meant here, is that once they shut up, they realize Jesus is Lord. I think this is a reference to the future, to the last king of each country at the end-time. It will take a while before every king realizes that Jesus is our Lord and God. As a matter of fact, they would never realize if Jesus did not revealed Himself first.]

When have kings shut their mouths because of Jesus Christ? 
When kings who formerly persecuted the Christians in their country and now see that it is because of Christians that their country is thriving, that it is Christians who pray for their king and country and that Christians all over the world help out the needy in the country, then they will shut their mouths. 
India has rejected the money from Christians, at least from the Compassion organization, because it is bringing the Gospel as well, which they do not accept. Soon India will see, however, how much more pain they will inflict on their own people. How much more poverty, illiteracy and—as a result of that—(child) prostitution and child labor will be present or increase in the coming years? All this is because India does not allow for (Christian) help from the outside and because it is worshipping the gods of Hinduism. 
When the kings of India realize this, they will shut their mouths. They will see that Christ is the only Savior, both morally, spiritually, economically and in a lot more fields. 
They might not have been warned of this message, but they will see and understand they were wrong.
