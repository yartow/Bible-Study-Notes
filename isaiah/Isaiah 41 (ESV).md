# Isaiah 41 (ESV) 
**Fear Not, for I Am with You**
*1 Listen to me in silence, O coastlands;*
*let the peoples renew their strength;*
*let them approach, then let them speak;*
*let us together draw near for judgment.*
*2 Who stirred up one from the east*
*whom victory meets at every step?*
*He gives up nations before him,*
*so that he tramples kings underfoot;*
*he makes them like dust with his sword,*
*like driven stubble with his bow.*

I do not understand this part of Isaiah. It is made clear in verse 4 that it is the Lord Who is doing all these things, but who then is the "one from the east" in verse 2? And what is meant by "whom victory meets"? Is the one who meets victory victorious or is he doomed, for no one could defeat victory, I would say. 
I can only think of the enemies in the east, the Babylonians or the peoples of the eras before and after them who were very victorious in their warfare and defeated (almost) every nation.

*3 He pursues them and passes on safely,*
*by paths his feet have not trod.*

What is the meaning of this verse then? Have the great empires not walked over paths? For sure they have not been waging war over the seas only.

*4 Who has performed and done this,*
*calling the generations from the beginning?*
*I, the Lord, the first,*
*and with the last; I am he.*
*5 The coastlands have seen and are afraid;*
*the ends of the earth tremble;*
*they have drawn near and come.*
*6 Everyone helps his neighbor*
*and says to his brother, “Be strong!”*
*7 The craftsman strengthens the goldsmith,*
*and he who smooths with the hammer him who strikes the anvil,*
*saying of the soldering, “It is good”;*
*and they strengthen it with nails so that it cannot be moved.*

The coastlands all gather together to resist the force from the east, but they do not realize that if God has chosen this enemy from the east then it is of no use to defend yourself against them. Should they defend themselves and give up immediately? That would have saved many lives, if not all, if the eastern enemy was not bloodthirsty and merely wanted power. Or should they have resisted? 
In the case of moral issues they should of course never give up their purity, even if it costs them their lives and that of others. 
Were they allowed to band together with their enemies to defeat their common enemy? That would be like sleeping with the enemy.

*8 But you, Israel, my servant,*
*Jacob, whom I have chosen,*
*the offspring of Abraham, my friend;*
*9 you whom I took from the ends of the earth,*
*and called from its farthest corners,*
*saying to you, “You are my servant,*
*I have chosen you and not cast you off”;*
::*10 fear not, for I am with you;*::
::*be not dismayed, for I am your God;*::
::*I will strengthen you, I will help you,*::
::*I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.*::
*11 Behold, all who are incensed against you*
*shall be put to shame and confounded;*
*those who strive against you*
*shall be as nothing and shall perish.*

Israel does not have to worry about the question I just asked, because they do not need to fight—at least not by joining other countries. God is on their side and nobody can hurt them. Those who want to attack them will perish. 
How many times has Israel proven that? In the many wars to conquer the land of Canaan I believe no Israelite has died except when they were disobeying God. If God could protect the Israelites' shoes from walking 40 years of the sand, then God can protect their lives as well from such a minor enemy. They will be *as nothing*, God has said here above and below. 

As for the case of Eritrea, what should they do? According to an Eritrean Uber cab driver I spoke with in Birmingham, there is no war between Muslims and Christians, but rather between the government and the religious. Should they band together and stride against the government? If the above applies to Eritrea as well, the Christians at least may know that their enemies will be put to shame if they strive against Christians. They shall perish. 

*12 You shall seek those who contend with you,*
*but you shall not find them;*
*those who war against you*
*shall be as nothing at all.*
*13 For I, the Lord your God,*
*hold your right hand;*
*it is I who say to you, “Fear not,*
*I am the one who helps you.”*
*14 Fear not, you worm Jacob,*
*you men of Israel!*
*I am the one who helps you, declares the Lord;*
*your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.*

The Israelites would look for nations of the same fate, being threatened by the Babylonians or Assyrian forces as well, but they did not find them. Not that there were any, but they either refused to work with Israel or they were under attack as well and could not provide the means to help. 
God planned it this way. God wanted Israel to know that the enemy could not hurt them because God was on their side. God is the One Who helps them but the Israelites need to call upon Him.

*15 Behold, I make of you a threshing sledge,*
*new, sharp, and having teeth;*
*you shall thresh the mountains and crush them,*
*and you shall make the hills like chaff;*
*16 you shall winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away,*
*and the tempest shall scatter them.*
*And you shall rejoice in the Lord;*
*in the Holy One of Israel you shall glory.*

Inspired by God's Word spoken live to him, Isaiah used such formidable analogies which speak to the limits of our imagination. How can there be a threshing sledge strong enough that its teeth can cut through mountains and crush them? The hardest things it can crush are dried up clay and rocks it can merely turn over. But if it can cut through mountains it must be sharp and made up of a material harder than rocks, which is not steel but a mineral, such as sapphire, or diamond and because it may not wear #todo/opzoeken slijten. The sledge would need a weight heavy enough to penetrate the mountains, which would be massive, even if made from lead. 
As impossible as this may sound, God can provide it. He could remove the mountains with a flick of His fingers, but people would perhaps be in awe for only a short period of time. But when they can see the details of how this incredible machine can crush the mountains into such small pieces that the wind can blow it away, then there is all the more glory for God when the people see this. 
However, in the case of evolution, even though that is not true, but even if it were, people do not see the glory of God in it. Where does new intelligence come from? Do they not see the beauty of nature, of an insect, a single petal or even a cell? Why would we find something a "simple" as these things beautiful? It is because we are wired to find these things beautiful. 
On the one hand, certain ethnic groups and cultures find their own people or cultural peculiarities beautiful. Black people like the beautiful black skin of one another and certain people in Africa have enlarged lips or necks. These are things that other peoples not necessarily appreciate, but black people do, because they are wired like that. 
As a Chinese I find some Chinese women beautiful while Dutch people have no interest in them and do not see them as beautiful in their eyes, because they are wired liked that. 
Of course, this is in a big part determined by nurture instead of nature, but whatever the cause, a wiring in the brains can occur.
Ascending the level of ethnicity, people have many things in common which they find beautiful, such as a smooth skin and all things related to the golden ratio, because *humans* are wired this way. Beauty is not in the eye of the beholder, it is in God's eye and He put this perception in us. There is no difference between nature and nurture now, unless we compare humans with animals. 

*17 When the poor and needy seek water,*
*and there is none,*
*and their tongue is parched with thirst,*
*I the Lord will answer them;*
*I the God of Israel will not forsake them.*

This may seem like a contradiction. God says He will provide, but will let us become thirsty first. Why would God do that? Why would He let us become so thirsty that our tongues are parched before He even answers? And that is merely an answer, consisting of words, it is not even water yet, so the thirst will continue. 
God has very good reasons for this. Thirsty people are better listeners. On the one hand the thirsty will not be able to hear what you say, because of their thirst, but on the other hand the thirsty are willing to take any measure to get their cups filled. As shown in the movie *178 hours* #todo/opzoeken  people are even willing to drink their own urine. 
The second reason is that we realize we have to call out to God in time. If we ask Him for help when we are at our limits, water would not help anymore. There are literally people who starved to death with food in their stomachs. Food needs time to digest. It will not help you to eat in the last few minutes or even hours before you would starve to death. You need to realize sooner that your body needs food. 
This goes for almost everything in life. When you lose your job and you are applying for  welfare #todo/opzoeken uitkering vs bijstand in het Engels
you cannot expect to receive money as soon as you have applied for it. It takes time. 
We must realize that we cannot command God to do things for us *right now*, just because we are in a hurry and desperate need. We have no right to say to God that he has to give us water right now because we will otherwise starve from thirst. We should have asked earlier.

What I have written hear applies to all people, both the poor and rich. The poor and needy perhaps have not caused this situation of poverty on themselves and as a result are suffering from thirst and hunger, but they too must realize that they need to call on God soon enough, before it is too late. 

Concluding, know that when you are thirsty and call on God, He will hear you and *answer* you, but not always immediately *provide*. 
Also, God will not forsake the poor and needy.

*18 I will open rivers on the bare heights,*
*and fountains in the midst of the valleys.*
*I will make the wilderness a pool of water,*
*and the dry land springs of water.*
*19 I will put in the wilderness the cedar,*
*the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive.*
*I will set in the desert the cypress,*
*the plane and the pine together,*
*20 that they may see and know,*
*may consider and understand together,*
*that the hand of the Lord has done this,*
*the Holy One of Israel has created it.*

All of the above are seemingly impossible things, but that makes God's work all the more incredible. It is impossible for rivers to be on bare heights, for where would the water then come from? There must be a mountain higher than those heights. 
In Israel this is even more impossible considering the heat and drought and the speed with which water evaporates. Almost a whole sea like the Dead Sea has evaporated already.

I don't know much about the cedar, acacia and other trees, but I assume that these are not trees who can live without much water. Yet God can let them grow in the desert. 
Only the hand of the Lord can do this. He created everything and He can defy logic. 

**The Futility of Idols**
*21 Set forth your case, says the Lord;*
*bring your proofs, says the King of Jacob.*
*22 Let them bring them, and tell us*
*what is to happen.*
*Tell us the former things, what they are,*
*that we may consider them,*
*that we may know their outcome;*
*or declare to us the things to come.*

If you really believe these idols can help you, bring them and let these statues tell us (i.e. God, but this can apply to us humans as well) what will happen in the future or what has happened in the past.
Often the past is just as large of a mystery as the future. We do not know *what* will happen in the future, but we do not know *why* things have happened in the past either. Can idols explain these to us? No they cannot. But God can, and through His prophets He has explained why some crucial figures in history were sick and died, why people were killed and why some countries arose above others. I am referring to among others Naaman, how the army of Sennacherib and himself as well were killed and why the Babylonians rebelled and #todo/opzoeken  overwonnen the Assyrians. 

*23 Tell us what is to come hereafter,*
*that we may know that you are gods;*
*do good, or do harm,*
*that we may be dismayed and terrified.*

If there is anything these idols can do, let them do it to show that they have powers. But they cannot. 
Of course, voodoo magicians can do many a "great" thing, through the power of the devil, as we have seen fortune tellers in the Bible as well, such as the little girl who could heal others. Perhaps she could tell the future and explain the past as well. But note that that was only by the grace of God. She could not tell when Jesus would come back a second time, for example, because Jesus Himself did not even know that. 

*24 Behold, you are nothing,*
*and your work is less than nothing;*
*an abomination is he who chooses you.*

These idols are not neutral; they are *negative*. If you have these they will decrease your value, they will increase your sin. Everything that is bad they will emphasize, your greed, lust and immorality. 
Do not choose this. It adds nothing to your life, not even materialistic things, and it will make your life worse. 
Compare this with Buddhism. How has this helped people? Perhaps a few of them are living in peace with others, but as for the rest, they are living their lives as they normally would have. Does Buddha provide hope, riches, fortune telling or prophesy about the past or future? None of these things does Buddha do or claim to do, neither will idols of him.

*25 I stirred up one from the north, and he has come,*
*from the rising of the sun, and he shall call upon my name;*
*he shall trample on rulers as on mortar,*
*as the potter treads clay.*

As opposed to all the other idols and fake gods, God's calling actually causes things to happen. When God stirs up a ruler from anywhere, he will come  and it will happen with him as God has foretold. He will rule or he will die, all according to God's plan. This happened with Sennacherib and Nebuchadnezzar, both were allowed to invade Israel but only to as far as God allowed it.

*26 Who declared it from the beginning, that we might know,*
*and beforehand, that we might say, “He is right”?*
*There was none who declared it, none who proclaimed,*
*none who heard your words.*

Furthermore, what have pagan gods declared, or explained, about the origins of the Earth or about anything at all *so that we might know*? What predictions have they done? I have never heard about predictions in the Qur'an or claims thereof by Muslims, never by Buddhists, Hindus or any other religion. Merely the ending of the world by the Aztecs and Mayas was predicted, in 2011 or 2012 #todo/opzoeken  but turned out to be wrong.  

*27 I was the first to say to Zion, “Behold, here they are!”*
*and I give to Jerusalem a herald of good news.*
*28 But when I look, there is no one;*
*among these there is no counselor*
*who, when I ask, gives an answer.*
*29 Behold, they are all a delusion;*
*their works are nothing;*
*their metal images are empty wind.*

God shows again how all the counselors, of idols, are fake. He tested them by speaking, by announcing a herald of good news. But no one heard it. If they really were prophets, they would have heard it, but there was none who answered, because they did not hear! 
All of these counselors, mediums with glass balls, are fake and they do not even see what God is telling them clearly. None of them predicted the coming of John the Baptist and the Messiah. They did not even recognize them when they were right in front of them. 
What use do they have? Nothing. And their metal images have even less use.
