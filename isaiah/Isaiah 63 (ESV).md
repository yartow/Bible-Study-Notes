# Isaiah 63 (ESV) 
**The Lord's Day of Vengeance**
*1 Who is this who comes from Edom,*
*in crimsoned garments from Bozrah,* #todo/opzoeken 
*he who is splendid in his apparel,*
*marching in the greatness of his strength?*
*“It is I, speaking in righteousness,*
*mighty to save.”*
*2 Why is your apparel red,*
*and your garments like his who treads in the winepress?*
*3 “I have trodden the winepress alone,*
*and from the peoples no one was with me;*
*I trod them in my anger*
*and trampled them in my wrath;*
*their lifeblood spattered on my garments,*
*and stained all my apparel.*
*4 For the day of vengeance was in my heart,*
*and my year of redemption had come.*
*5 I looked, but there was no one to help;*
*I was appalled, but there was no one to uphold;*
*so my own arm brought me salvation,*
*and my wrath upheld me.*
*6 I trampled down the peoples in my anger;*
*I made them drunk in my wrath,*
*and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.”*

At a first glance this part seems to be about God Who is angry and trods the winepress in His anger, inducing, if you will, His wrath into these grapes. But at a closer look you can see that He was actually looking for a chance to be relieved of His anger. 
In the Bible the cup filled with wine is a symbol of God's wrath and Jesus was the One drinking from it. In other words, He was taking God's wrath on Himself. 
God, in His anger sought to look for some way to ventilate this anger. He wanted to bring a change. He would introduce the year of redemption, and not only introduce but also implement it. However, verse 5 says there was no one to uphold. Not that no one needed any help, but no one needed help from God! So this redemption did not come, but God's wrath continued and He trampled down peoples. 
Maybe Jesus, Who is the executioner and the execution Himself of God's plan of redemption, would have come at the time of verse 4, when God wanted to help, in 700 AD, but the people of Israel and its neighbors did not want Gods help at that time. They were not enough in trouble to call out for God, just like they were not on many occasions and most of the time in the period of the Judges. 
The period of the two kingdoms as well were cyclic in the sense that a good king would follow a period of reign by bad kings, who would destroy some things or everything his evil predecessors had built to worship idols. In the end only to become evil themselves rebuild at least some of it again. 
In the times of the Judges the Israelites did not want help until God let other nations invade them, and then they cried out to God. They did that until they were satisfied but then afterwards started going their own ways again. 

**The Lord's Mercy Remembered**
*7 I will recount the steadfast love of the Lord,*
*the praises of the Lord,*
*according to all that the Lord has granted us,*
*and the great goodness to the house of Israel*
*that he has granted them according to his compassion,*
*according to the abundance of his steadfast love.*

Isaiah remembers here the many things the Lord has done for Israel. Isaiah is one of the relatively few who have actually read the whole Bible, I assume, and actually *could* read at that literary level. Even more so, I presume that Isaiah and only a few others could *interpret* and get the deeper meaning of the Bible, for he was a prophet, worthy enough to write one of the most important books of the Bible.
He could see—more clearly than we ever could—the *abundance* of God's *steadfast* love. Steadfast is the right word to describe it. We do not often encounter this word, especially not of a person, because not many people have this. But it is an adjective here, not of God but of one of His characteristics—which makes His love even greater. God is love, and His love is steadfast—among others. 

#todo/opzoeken  which books of the Bible could be excluded without any significant impact, if any? 

*8 For he said, “Surely they are my people,*
*children who will not deal falsely.”*
*And he became their Savior.*

#biblestudy/questions Now this strikes me as a very strange question. Why would God say something like "surely", which is usually posited in a question-like way of speaking                    
No, God did not ask this, nor did He state this rhetorically. God knew that His children would not lie. Generally speaking, there was not a lot of lying in God's people. 
There was some lying between Jews, for example when we look at David's sons who lied to each other and to their father, but as for their response towards God, they were honest in rejecting or accepting Him, except for one king, who said he did not want God's help because he did not want to "bother" God #todo/opzoeken but in fact wanted to fix things himself.
However, still, I do not think this is what is meant here. Why would God be the Savior of children who merely "do not deal falsely"? I would say it is not sufficient to "not lie" in order to be saved. One needs to love God with all his heart.
Of course a counterargument could be that, first of all, none of us deserve God's love, and it is God Who chooses those Whom He wishes to save. Second of all, the Israelites are His children, whatever they do, and a good father loves His children more than his own life. 

#todo/opzoeken  Do Jews have a reputation and actual record of cheating people and if so, is this only the case with secular Jews? 

*9 In all their affliction he was afflicted,*
*and the angel of his presence saved them;*
*in his love and in his pity he redeemed them;*
*he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.*

It is uncertain which time this verse specifically is about, but it seems like a reference to the times of the Israelites in Egypt. On the other hand, it could also refer to any of the periods before God saved, i.e. within the cycles of the judges this could refer to any of those moments when God was with them. 
The next verse, however, is about those moments the people rebelled against God. 

*10 But they rebelled*
*and grieved his Holy Spirit;*
*therefore he turned to be their enemy,*
*and himself fought against them.*

Why does God specifically mention His Holy Spirit here and not Himself by any of His names? I understand that if God the Father is grieving, then all three Persons of the Trinity would grieve. 
Sometimes one can specifically grieve the only one Person. For example, if one denies God's *works*, i.e. Jesus' work on the cross, then that would mostly grieve Jesus Himself. If one denies God's love for him, it would grieve the Father. However, if one denies the *power* of God, then that would grieve the Holy Spirit.
In those instances where God saved the people of Israel, all throughout Moses to the end of the two kingdoms, *every* time it was the Holy Spirit Who saved Israel. Granted, not every salvation came through unexplainable events or timing such as Gideon and Deborah had encountered, but even the logically explainable things, such as David beating Goliath through bravery and technology, there too the Holy Spirit was present. 
Elijah noticed this, he saw the hundred thousands of angels surrounding them, not allowing any Assyrian #todo/opzoeken  or was Israelian? 
soldier to make any wrong move. Every move was literally watched and controlled by God. 
The fact that none of the Israelites had broken sandals after forty years of walking in the desert proves this. 

*11 Then he remembered the days of old,*
*of Moses and his people.*
*Where is he who brought them up out of the sea*
*with the shepherds of his flock?*
*Where is he who put in the midst of them*
*his Holy Spirit,*

If God remembered the days of old then in the previous verse where Isaiah mentioned rebellion, he was not talking about the rebellion of the first generation of Israelites from Egypt, but the things that happened afterwards. 
To me it is peculiar that God remembers the days of Moses and his people and that this changes his mind. It is like a father who is punishing his adult son now remember him being little, say six or eight years old, and rebelling towards him. It is by no means a cute or lovely sight at all. Rather, it shows how powerless the child is. Even as an adult, say an eighteen year old, he still is powerless, without experience, wisdom and riches. Why would this change God's heart? Why would He relent? 
The answer is given at the end of verses 12 and 14. 

*12 who caused his glorious arm*
*to go at the right hand of Moses,*
*who divided the waters before them*
*to make for himself an everlasting name,*

The first reason You, God, saved the Israelites from Egypt and performed all these miracles, is because You were making an everlasting Name for Yourself. Others can benefit from Your Name. Those who are worthy to carry Your Name—which is none except Jesus—or whom You have chosen and allowed to carry Your Name—which are the Israelites and Christians—will benefit from Your name and experience the peace and hope they may have in You. On the other hand, they will suffer from the attacks of Your enemies as well. 

*13 who led them through the depths?*
*Like a horse in the desert,*
*they did not stumble.*
*14 Like livestock that go down into the valley,*
*the Spirit of the Lord gave them rest.*
*So you led your people,*
*to make for yourself a glorious name.*

The second reason you saved them and led them is because Your Spirit is the only thing that could give the Israelites, and for that matter the whole world, rest—true rest. 
Also, by denying that rest, by choosing Egypt with its "affluence" of meat (though only little was for the Jews) over freedom, rest and the true God Who not only saved them but revealed Himself to them and ultimately died Himself to save them, that is truly showing utter disrespect for the Holy Spirit and grieving Him. 
It is like a king willing to exert his power to save an #todo/opzoeken/engels onbelangrijk persoon
a minuscule person like us, a person who is even lower than the lowest slave, to personally rescue him from jail, on the way killing the guards and people who holding this slave hostage, people who are in fact family of the king himself, just so that this slave could be free. 
Now they are out in the open, in the forest, without food and water, and the slave complains about why he saved him and says he wants to go back. "Don't you remember? It was you who called out to be saved? I have killed my own family members, whom I love, just to save you. They are bad and treated you worse, and you want to go back just for a little bit of food and water? Are you crazy? Even if they give you food and water, they will kill you right after or even worse, torture you to give up my name, before killing you. I have managed to save you from the deepest dungeon with the highest security available in the country. Don't you think I am smart enough to create a getaway plan with at least food and shelter?"
This slave is dumb, gulzig, short-sighted, ungrateful--> unworthy in our eyes to be saved. But the king so loves Him, because, it appeared. He is the king's own child. #todo/opzoeken #stories/bible# #todo/idea

**Prayer for Mercy**
*15 Look down from heaven and see,*
*from your holy and beautiful habitation.*
*Where are your zeal and your might?*
*The stirring of your inner parts and your compassion*
*are held back from me.*

I feel it is kind of disrespectful to speak in such a way to God, in rhetorical way asking God where His zeal and might are, while God Himself and Isaiah know really well these are and why they are not shown. It is for the punishment of Israel. Then why does Isaiah still need to ask such a thing? Where is the rhetoric? 
The convincing power comes in the form of urging God by saying that zeal and might are part of God Himself. Zeal and might are not what He does, it is what He *is*. Isaiah knows that God's inner parts is stirring and God *wants* to do something about it. 
It is far too disrespectful and downgrading to say that God has an internal struggle or a dilemma, even in poetic or metaphorical terms, but Isaiah phrases this in such a way which is true (God *does* want to show His might), factual (it is held back from me) and humble (through this prayer and through Isaiah's pleas). 

*16 For you are our Father,*
*though Abraham does not know us,*
*and Israel does not acknowledge us;*
*you, O Lord, are our Father,*
*our Redeemer from of old is your name.*

I am not sure of the exact meaning here, but I think Isaiah is saying here that the Israelites have strayed so far from God that Abraham and Jacob (Israel) would not even know or acknowledge them anymore. But God the Father will always know Israel, however disguised with sin and dirt.

*17 O Lord, why do you make us wander from your ways*
*and harden our heart, so that we fear you not?*
*Return for the sake of your servants,*
*the tribes of your heritage.*

I do not know why Isaiah would ask such a thing. Does he not know the answer himself? Is it not because the Israelites would not listen to God for many times, just like the Egyptians would not? 
And have the Israelites actually become like those never ruled by God (cf. verse 19)? No, I do not think that is the case. God still loved the Israelites and he cared for them, never letting them be blotted out and always punishing the nations who mistreated the Israelites. 
Even now, or just like it, most Israelites (Jews) are not obedient to God. In the West they are called secular Jews and yet they are mistreated by the Left. It is striking that these secular Jews want to be like the ones who persecute them. It was Hitler, who was left and socialist, who wanted to exterminate the Jews. And now, the Democrats, who are also racist, left and socialist, are puttings Jews and Israel at a disadvantageous position in many fields. In Harvard and other Ivy Leagues the percentage of Jews is capped. In the United Nations Israel is mocked—which would not be an understatement—and reprimanded. 
In the same way, the Jews in Judah were persecuted and ridiculed by the Assyrians and the Babylonians. This literally happened when Sennacherib's army lead (#todo/opzoeken see Hezekiah...) mocked God in front of the people in Hebrew so that everyone could understand.
Still, except for that period maybe, the Jews wanted to be like them, to have gods that do not "impose their will" on them (which God never did). Of course it is understandable that most would want to be like the Assyrians, being the ruler of all others. It is on our "image" to rule, rather than being ruled. That in itself discredits the integrity of the Jews, for God never wanted us to rule over other peoples like the Assyrians did, with much unnecessary bloodshed and violence. 
But that is not the worst the Jews did. In admiring their neighboring rulers, they also admired their religions. It is like one admires Cristiano Ronaldo's football talent (nothing wrong with that) and the attention of women he gets (understandable), but then they imitate his hairstyle, clothes, and even the bad things he does. This is when idolatry takes place. The latter will not get you to become a great football player. 
In the same way the Jews did irrelevant things, although they did not idolize Assyria or Babylon, but they idolized themselves and wanted to indulge in everything they had as well, freedom in everything with only the cost of an animal sacrifice. 

*18 Your holy people held possession for a little while;*
*our adversaries have trampled down your sanctuary.*
*19 We have become like those over whom you have never ruled,*
*like those who are not called by your name.*

Isaiah means with this last statement in verse 19, "we have become like those" that God treats Israel as if they were Assyria or Babylon, which, as explained above, is not true at all. However, adding the information from what I wrote about this verse one could also interpret this statement as if it concerned Israel's behavior. It is not God whose treatment of Israel has changed, it is Israel whose behavior has changed into that of those over whom God has never ruled.
