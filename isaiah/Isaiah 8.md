# Isaiah 8
**Isaiah 8 (NIV) Isaiah and His Children as Signs**
*1 The Lord said to me, “Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary pen: Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.” 2 So I called in Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah as reliable witnesses for me. 3 Then I made love to the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the Lord said to me, “Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz. 4 For before the boy knows how to say ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria. ”*

Dear Father, you show your prophecies even through the names of our children. Even if this name indicates a bad event for Israel, it will still give you glory, for your prophecy will be known as long as the boy's name is known. If he lives up to eighty, people will remember for at least that period that the Lord spoke, and we did not heed His warnings and brought this disaster upon ourselves. 

*5 The Lord spoke to me again:*
*6 “Because this people has rejected*
*the gently flowing waters of Shiloah*
*and rejoices over Rezin*
*and the son of Remaliah,*
*7 therefore the Lord is about to bring against them*
*the mighty floodwaters of the Euphrates—*
*the king of Assyria with all his pomp.*
*It will overflow all its channels,*
*run over all its banks*
*8 and sweep on into Judah, swirling over it,*
*passing through it and reaching up to the neck.*
*Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land,*
*Immanuel!”*

Not only have the Israelites rejected God, they have rejected His gentleness. Why would anyone reject that? If someone says *it is ok*, after you have said you are sorry, would you ever reject this person and say "no, it is not ok"? Only if you cannot forgive yourself would something like that happen. 
Instead the Israelites looked for the fearsome kings of Syria (Aram) and Israel. It is like the behavior of girls in the sex industry, who tend to look for bad and abusive boyfriends, who drink and smoke, and do not treat them well, while they reject the loving and tender guys, who really care about them. Why would they do that? It is because their nature has been broken through abusive relationships.

The other thing is that they can see how bad the other person is, much worse than they are, and therefore see less how bad they themselves are. Contrasting with a good person they would see very clearly how bad they are.  

*9 Raise the war cry, you nations, and be shattered!*
*Listen, all you distant lands.*
*Prepare for battle, and be shattered!*
*Prepare for battle, and be shattered!*
*10 Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted;*
*propose your plan, but it will not stand,*
*for God is with us.*

All other nations will be shattered if God is not with them. It is a little strange why this line is put below the one above. Because in he previous verse God says He is going to destroy this nation, North Israel, and almost completely destroy Judah as well, up to the neck. But now He is saying, He is actually letting His prophet Isaiah say, "God is with us", while God was *not* with Israel anymore. 
The nuance lies in how Isaiah says his words. 
He states the truth about Israel and Judah, that they will be punished by the Assyrians, but that does not mean the Assyrians are the good guys. Isaiah is telling the Assyrians that they as well will be shattered. 
Rather yet, any plan or strategy they have will be thwarted, because it is *their* plan and not God's. 

*11 This is what the Lord says to me with his strong hand upon me, warning me not to follow the way of this people:*
*12 “Do not call conspiracy*
*everything this people calls a conspiracy;*
*do not fear what they fear,*
*and do not dread it.*

Fear, but be sure of what to fear. Do not fear people and do no fear conspiracies. Know that if you are punished, it is because of God, not because of what humans planned.

*13 The Lord Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy,*
*he is the one you are to fear,*
*he is the one you are to dread.*
*14 He will be a holy place;*
*for both Israel and Judah he will be*
*a stone that causes people to stumble*
*and a rock that makes them fall.*
*And for the people of Jerusalem he will be*
*a trap and a snare.*
*15 Many of them will stumble;*
*they will fall and be broken,*
*they will be snared and captured.”*

The Lord alone is our greatest Savior but He can be the greatest destroyer as well. Him alone do we need to fear. 
It is God Himself Who saved the Israelites and gave them their name, the name they can carry of being Jews, flowers of God, although the multitude was not following Him anymore. But it is God Himself Who is he stumbling block that makes the Jews fall as well. For God is the One Who has created the Law and the Jews cannot keep it. 
If God had not created this Law then the Jews would not have sinned. This is an erroneous statement. It is because of this Law that they were confirmed in what is good and bad, which they already knew in their hearts. And now that they are confirmed, they must abide by it. 
Is God too strict in setting a Law of such high standards? No, He is not *too* strict. He is as strict as He should be. But the people have a way out, they can ask forgiveness and offer sacrifices, and that is not even what God cares about most, He cares most about us being merciful to others (cf. Hosea 6:4). If we can do that, out of love for our neighbors and for God, we probably would not even need sacrifices, because Jesus' sacrifice would be enough. 
The Jews themselves have chosen to not listen to their conscience, and chosen their own way. This is why they were captured. 
One step further, as this prophecy has a second implication. It prophesies Jesus' coming as the Messiah as well. Those who do not accept Him, will stumble of this rock as well. Fortunately, this rock is not hard to cling on to, see notes on the next two verses, but unfortunately for Jews this has not been the case in practice. 

*16 Bind up this testimony of warning*
*and seal up God’s instruction among my disciples.*
*17 I will wait for the Lord,*
*who is hiding his face from the descendants of Jacob.*
*I will put my trust in him.*

I am not sure who God's disciples are. Perhaps it is a remnant of actual believers within the Jews, such as the pharisee who looked up Jesus in the middle of the night, or the other one who stood up for Paul and Peter, or Simeon and perhaps even Joseph and Mary, he Jews who were actually still obedient despite the downfall of Jewish society. 
But it is true, God has hidden His face from the Jews. Not only during the four hundred years before the incarnation of Jesus, but also after it. The Jews right now are not seeking God, the orthodox ones might earnestly doing so, He is still hidden from them because He has already shown Himself, through the New Testament and a plethora of books. And not only that, but through the last two millennia where we have seen social, economic and scientific inventions by Christians, and political ones, the founding fathers were Christians and the whole nation of the United States is based on Christianity through the Constitution. Through Christianity slavery has been abolished.
Even though other religions who promote peace such as Buddhism probably would not   have wanted slavery to occur either, they were not the ones to stop it. God has shown Himself clearly by doing all that He stands for through Christianity, which means that God has not hidden Himself anymore! 
What a delight for Jews to hear, especially after having heard Isaiah's words for centuries! 

*18 Here am I, and the children the Lord has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the Lord Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion.*

It is because the Jews are God's symbols, and because they are signs and symbols that the Lord Almighty is real and still existent, that the Jews still know their identity. Without Jews on this world, it would *seem* like God has left His own children. 
The atheists would surely come up with an argument as: "So this God of yours abandons His own children because they did not obey Him anymore." While that in fact is true and totally makes sense, because God not only has given them many chances to repent, the people were atrocious in their sins as well. 
Also, without Jews in this world, Christians could tell about God and how He started with Abraham, but where would the living proof be, that is the descendants of Abraham? The world does not realize that they are living proof, for where else do Jews come from? 

**The Darkness Turns to Light**
*19 When someone tells you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living? 20 Consult God’s instruction and the testimony of warning. If anyone does not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.*

This part describes some people here on Earth. It appears that even in the days of Isaiah such people already existed. In those days idolaters were the ones telling us to consult mediums and spiritists. Right now, it is the left wing, or whatever it is called in your country who is doing that. In the Netherlands these are the political party D66, but in the States the Democrats.
Remarkably enough, in one way, both idolaters, such as New Age-followers and hipsters doing all kinds of yoga and pilates stuff, are all on the left and proponents of LGBT-rights and pro-choice stances. But atheists are on the left as well and support the same causes, while they do *not* believe in any god. So there is a side of everyone who does *not* believe and who *does* believe in a god, so long as it is not the Judeo-Christian God, 

We find this less remarkable in itself, because we know that the same power is behind these two movements, if you will. The world might, however, put forward arguments that Muslims as well are pro-life and in some sense creationists and support anti-LGBT and same-sex marriage causes. 
The devil does that to cause distraction so that distinctions between God and him cannot easily be made. 

*21 Distressed and hungry, they will roam through the land; when they are famished, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God.*

It is these kind of people, the pro-choicers and LGBT-supporters and feminists who roam through the land and stir up every place. Not only do others need to be tolerant, they need to do as they do and accept what they do.
They are cursing our God at this very instant, though they do not believe in them, and they will curse everyone else, even their own king, which in this case—at least until a few months ago—was Hillary Clinton, "queen of politics". Though she has not been publicly dropped by the Left, her tweets do seem to be very sad with a desperate longing to become president in next elections. 
At this very moment they are cursing their own strongest supporters, Harvey Weinstein, who is (one of the) king(s) of Hollywood, one could say, next to Steven Spielberg, as well as Kevin Spacey, one of their own, as he's come out as gay. 
We know that the four biggest megaphones are Hollywood, politics, the media and education. It is good to see that at least one of those megaphones is fading, which is Hollywood, and that politics is rising due to the Republicans on the right, through Trump's political incorrectness.

*22 Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness.*

Furthermore, note what verse 22 says. They will see only distress and darkness. This is exactly what the Left is doing now. They are predicting doom by hailing the Global Warming theory. Who knows what other theory will come up next?
The good thing is that they will be thrust into this same darkness as well. If they want to live in the Middle Ages, they will be thrown into the Middle Ages. 
The hypocrisy lies in that they want to enjoy America's freedom, but they want to use this freedom to destroy it. The sad thing about it is that they, both the people and the Democrats, do not even know about this.
