**Isaiah 25 (NIV) Praise to the Lord**
*1 Lord, you are my God;*
*I will exalt you and praise your name,*
*for in perfect faithfulness*
*you have done wonderful things,*
*things planned long ago.*
*2 You have made the city a heap of rubble,*
*the fortified town a ruin,*
*the foreigners’ stronghold a city no more;*
*it will never be rebuilt.*
*3 Therefore strong peoples will honor you;*
*cities of ruthless nations will revere you.*

Reading the first few lines I would have expected wonderful things that God has created, but instead a list of destroyed things is given. 
To some, the artists and scientists perhaps, God shows his glory through wonderful creations and the beauty of these in nature, including in outer space. But to the strong and ruthless, who lack the finesse of perceiving beauty in art, God shows His strength and impresses them in this way. Indestructible towns and fortresses and strongholds God can destroy within seconds in such a way that they will never be rebuilt. That is some feat no one can do. 
God, show Your strength to the ruthless people here on Earth, to the dictators of the world, the gangsters and the pimps, so that they may praise You and fear You for Who You are and what You can do to them. 

*4 You have been a refuge for the poor,*
*a refuge for the needy in their distress,*
*a shelter from the storm*
*and a shade from the heat.*
*For the breath of the ruthless*
*is like a storm driving against a wall*
*5 and like the heat of the desert.*

To the poor You show Your comfort, You show them that You are a refuge and a shelter as well. A very strong shelter Who is hard to the ruthless but soft to the poor and needy. 

*You silence the uproar of foreigners;*
*as heat is reduced by the shadow of a cloud,*
*so the song of the ruthless is stilled.*

As You show in many of Your actions, You are amazing in providing miracles through subtle ways. With one action You can destroy the ruthless and help the poor at the same time. You provide a cloud that silences the heat which provides refuge for the need as well. 
Mostly, the things You do go more than two ways. Things You do affect everyone on this planet. 

*6 On this mountain the Lord Almighty will prepare*
*a feast of rich food for all peoples,*
*a banquet of aged wine—*
*the best of meats and the finest of wines.*
*7 On this mountain he will destroy*
*the shroud that enfolds all peoples,*
*the sheet that covers all nations;*

The Lord our God is not a God of destruction alone, for He destroys but builds as well. With sadness in His heart He destroyed the towns where so much of the all the idolatry took place, He destroyed His beautiful works of architecture and perhaps in those towns. Even though those people created these works with their hand, it was and is always God's inspiration that man receives before working it out. 
Even a human architect himself does not help build a tower or building, but he watches as his design is being built and the workers can enjoy seeing a beautiful piece of art, even though they did not design it. Would the architect be sad when his building is destroyed? He did not pay for it nor did he worked on the building itself. He even got paid for his work on the design, so what is it to him when one of the buildings of his design is destroyed? 
Even more so it is with God. He did *not* get paid for His designs, he did *not* get credits for His designs and He had to destroy His work *Himself*. We can all understand the agony of a situation like this. No one should experience a feeling as this, yet God did experience that and He still does, although I cannot think of any present day examples. 
But what I do know is that God is a god Who builds as well. He is still building new buildings and cities, even though the people working on it do not know that the inspiration is from God. As a matter of fact, all beauty is from God and inspired by God. 
Was Jesus handsome then? Perhaps not, but purposely so that the people would not be blinded by His beauty, just like God did not make Him rich, even though He possesses all riches on Earth, for people look only at the outside and focus too much on that.
God builds relations, He heals broken hearts. When he prepares a banquet, He gives the best meat and the finest wines. And just like I mentioned in my notes on the verses above, He can strike two birds with one stone. He destroys the shroud that enfolds all peoples and the sheet that covers all nations.
He destroys racism for example, or in other words He builds up equal treatment and unity. Again, God can build and destroy at the same time. 

*8 he will swallow up death forever.*

There is something that enfolds all peoples. First of all, the fact that we are human beings is at least still recognized by this world. But it is more than that, it is something sinful. It is sin itself. 
This sin presents itself in many ways, by racism and discrimination, for example through the caste system in India, through materialism, which has so haunted the Israelites and for which they were severely admonished, because they did not take care of the poor but rather took from them, and something that does not look like a sin, but really is: worrying and not putting your faith in God, which leads to idolatry because one is then putting his faith in something else.
But God will destroy these cloths of sin and without sin, death is gone as well.

*The Sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears*
*from all faces;*
*he will remove his people’s disgrace*
*from all the earth.*
*The Lord has spoken.*

It cannot be said enough: God can comfort you. God can fill in the hole in your heart that a beloved one has left there, because He is a greater beloved One. 
God can take away the disgrace others have put on you, because He took this disgrace upon Himself and gave you His grace instead. 
::From *dis*grace to *His* grace.:: #church/material
And the Lord has spoken. He has not promised or sworn, for He does not need to. ::His words are His *Word*.:: It is always true and will always be so. 

*9 In that day they will say,*
*“Surely this is our God;*
*we trusted in him, and he saved us.*
*This is the Lord, we trusted in him;*
*let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation.”*

The poor will say that God has rescued them, but the rich will not. Not that God favors the poor because of their low status—although God's heart does go out to help the helpless, which is in His character, and we know this because humans have this partially as well—but because they are not proud. In the same way God does not help the rich because they are proud and refuse to help the poor and acknowledge God. 
The poor will get the honor of saying "He saved us", while the rich will be the ones regretting their chosen path in life. 

*10 The hand of the Lord will rest on this mountain;*
*but Moab will be trampled in their land*
*as straw is trampled down in the manure.*
*11 They will stretch out their hands in it,*
*as swimmers stretch out their hands to swim.*
*God will bring down their pride*
*despite the cleverness of their hands.*
*12 He will bring down your high fortified walls*
*and lay them low;*
*he will bring them down to the ground,*
*to the very dust.*

Once more this opposition between two peoples or two lands is shown. One that will be saved and the other that will not. It may seem unfair, but one must realize that God has given them ample chance, first of all. The Moabites have had several hundreds or even thousands of years since Moses to change their ways. They had seen the miracles of the God of the Israelites. Even Jericho, though 40 years after the events, knew what happened to the Egyptians and how God made the Red Sea split. Furthermore, the whole Middle-Eastern world knew that Israelites were less prone to diseases. There was more than enough evidence for them to follow the Israelites or at least follow their ways. 
Second of all, the Moabites have hardly been punished as hard as the Israelites have been for their transgressions. God understood that these Gentiles were not instructed as well as the Israelites had been. If the Israelites had done the same things as the Moabites, and in part they had done so, Israel would have been wiped away all along. But it is through the prayer of faithful ones like Moses for the people of Israel that God has relented and added to His patience.
