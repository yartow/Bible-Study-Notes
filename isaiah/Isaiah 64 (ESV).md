# Isaiah 64 (ESV)
*1 Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down,*
*that the mountains might quake at your presence—*
*2 as when fire kindles brushwood*
*and the fire causes water to boil—*
*to make your name known to your adversaries,*
*and that the nations might tremble at your presence!*
*3 When you did awesome things that we did not look for,*
*you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.*

Oh, how I long for God to come and show His might. I know I will be terrified, but not as much as my enemies will be. This is the main aspect of my personality, that I want to prove them wrong and prove that I was right. It is often not possible (for me) to reason with others. Either they do not understand the logic or I cannot explain it well enough. But if a miracle were to happen or when God shows Himself, they will understand. They will see that I was right. 
That of course, is not the purpose of God's coming. It is not to show that *I* am right, it is to show that God was right, His Word was truth and His promises shown to be kept. It is to glorify Him and put everyone on their knees so that He gets even more glory. 
Either way, I am glad when He comes.
As mentioned, we will all fear Him. As fearful as thunder might sound when one is near it—and I have never actually been near it nor was I outside, but the closest I have gotten to was miles away and it was indeed terrifying and deafening—or as hot and uncontrollable a forrest fire is, where nothing can stop its insatiable hunger for more, even more so will God's presence be when He returns. But yet, I long to see and experience it because it is He. I had rather receive the punishment of God than the loving kiss of the Satan—my own paraphrase of a certain proverb. #todo/opzoeken 

::*4 From of old no one has heard*::
::*or perceived by the ear,*::
::*no eye has seen a God besides you,*::
::*who acts for those who wait for him.*::

This is such a wonderful verse because it makes the statement that none is like God, not even the other gods. Other gods do not act for their followers, but they treat them as slave. They do not save their follows, because they are not worth saving. 
But our God *acts*, because He sees us as His children and His friends. He really reaches out to us, unlike Buddha, who in the original version does not help earthlings and in the Chinese version only helps people when they are willing to sacrifice something. 
You, God, are great. Not because you reach out to us, but it is because of your greatness that you reach out to us. 
There is no reason to mention why You are great, oh God. It is just Who you are. You are the definition of greatness. Everything great is measured by Your greatness and everything

*5 You meet him who ::joyfully:: works righteousness,*
*those who remember you in your ways.*

God is indeed One Who comes to those who *joyfully* work righteousness. It is of much importance that one does his work for God with joy. God has given man free will, and everything must come from that free will, otherwise it is not out of love, and that is prerequisite for God. God cannot accept anything that is not done out of love. 
That is the big difference between our world and His', in our imperfect and broken world we accept imperfect things. We accept gifts not given out of love. Employees who only work for the money. Obedience without respect. We even accept "love" without love—which really comes to accepting only the good things about love that are actually not love but *come with* love. 

*Behold, you were angry, and we sinned;*
*in our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved?*
*6 We have all become like one who is unclean,*
*and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment.*
*We all fade like a leaf,*
*and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.*

But what happens when one does not work righteousness—let alone doing it joyfully? The Israelites (and this applies to us as well) had sinned for such a long time that they have not only become unclean spiritually, but also *like* one who is literally hygienically unclean—like one who infects and contaminates others when he touches them. Like one who wears polluted garments and germs spread themselves in the air without even touching it. And this person cannot clean or wash himself because as soon as he puts on this garment he becomes unclean again. Or he washes himself with the garment and the body may get partially clean, but the garment will only be minimally washed. 
After some time, however, both the body and the garment will get dirtier because of the humidity. Molds and other things will grow then even faster. 

*7 There is no one who calls upon your name,*
*who rouses himself to take hold of you;*
*for you have hidden your face from us,*
*and have made us melt in the hand of our iniquities.*

This is a very serious accusation against the Jews. I understand why the Jews killed their prophets when they spoke like that. It is claiming no exclusivity, everyone is included in this statement—most likely the prophet himself too. And what they are accused of makes things even worse: they are accused of not even calling out God's name. Such a simple thing, which the Jews most likely did do—albeit in the same breath as calling out the other gods' names, with utter disrespect for the Lord of lords—they were being accused of, which enraged them even more. But Isaiah knew what he was talking about. 
He knew that even prophets do not call on the name of the Lord if this were not given by the Lord first. 

*8 But now, O Lord, you are our Father;*
::*we are the clay, and you are our potter;*::
*we are all the work of your hand.*

This is where Isaiah admits—mostly on behalf of his people—that we humans are merely clay. We should be thankful for even being chosen to become anything at all. We should be grateful for being used as a vessel in God's great plan and purpose. Even more so, God has given each of us a different purpose. No two people and purposes are exactly the same, just like two handmade cups will never be exactly the same. 
But humility is necessary to come to this conclusion. Our so-called greatness must be put under that of God. We must realize we are nothing without Him. I do not mean that we are worth only a *little* without  Him, but *nothing* at all.

*9 Be not so terribly angry, O Lord,*
*and remember not iniquity forever.*
*Behold, please look, we are all your people.*

To me this part sounds like a plea for mercy, like one begging on his knees with desperate cries. Seeing what I wrote in verse 8 that is the only way to approach God. We are nothing, as a figure of speech I would say we are worth even less than clay. Clay is fertile, lots of things can grow in it. One can do lots of things with it as well, on the skin it moistens it, when it gets hard one can use it for bricks or pottery. Ceramic has unique properties that allow it to withstand extremely high temperatures. The nose #todo/opzoeken  of the space rockets are made of a certain kind of ceramic material. Suits of specialized firemen contain ceramics and can withstand up to 5000 degrees Celsius #todo/opzoeken . Also, molds can be made of ceramic because molten metals will not destroy these molds. 
At the same time ceramic can be very #todo/opzoeken/engels bros
fragile and expensive, when it is used for priceless Ming vases for example. #church/material
Is clay something worthless? Yes. Intrinsically it has no worth. We are worthless when we are not used by God. But when God uses us, whether he puts a seed in us to let it grow, or whether He molds it to make a useful object out of it, it gains worth.
It is fitting for us to beg for mercy. It is by grace that we have been molded—for we could have remained clay—and it is by mercy when we are not destroyed when we are not fit for His purpose for us. 
Some have been destroyed, others have remained—only by the mercy of God. 

*10 Your holy cities have become a wilderness;*
*Zion has become a wilderness,*
*Jerusalem a desolation.*
*11 Our holy and beautiful house,*
*where our fathers praised you,*
*has been burned by fire,*
*and all our pleasant places have become ruins.*

God's wrath knows an end, but it is not as little as we think. God does not punish with merely a slap on the wrists and leaves it with that. If He pursues He can go on until nothing is left. Even His own people and temple He is willing to destroy. His people He would have destroyed in Egypt if it were not for Moses intervening. God listened and delayed His punishment. He acted out in smaller ways by the death of 15.000 Israelites when the Israelites worshipped the two golden calfs, xxx Israelites when they disobeyed God and were killed by poisonous snakes #todo/opzoeken  All of of this is only the Torah. 

During Joshua's reign we 600 #todo/opzoeken Israelites, during Achan's disobedience, during the reign of David we even read about the deaths of xxx Israelites due to David's pride, incited by the devil.
The numbers in itself do not seem to follow a pattern. Of course, the worse the atrocity, the more people die. 

It is important to notice that David's disobedience in two cases, one where he became proud and demanded a counting of the soldiers, and one where committed adultery with Bathsheba. In the first case thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands Israelites died, while in the latter, only one. The goal was not to let David repent—I think—for I think that one death or even the warning through a prophet would have let him repented. But the severity of a king committing adultery and willing to cover it up by murdering one person—which is a trespass of the xxth and tenth commandment #todo/opzoeken —is much smaller than a king showing signs of pride in himself instead of in God—which is a trespass of the first two commandments. 
Tim Keller has mentioned that all sins inevitably lead to the sin of pride, because we replace God with ourself as our idol and we only listen to our idol. 
A king who sees himself as God knows no limits to anything. That is why God had to intervene more severely here than in the case of adultery. #church/material

Another thing to notice is that the temple itself means nothing to God. It is merely material and God can recreate it at any time. 

*12 Will you restrain yourself at these things, O Lord?*
*Will you keep silent, and afflict us so terribly?*

This verse seems to be a question and a request at the same time. When we look at the explanation of the question, we will see that it cannot be a request. As for the question, it is to ask God whether He will restrain Himself. First of all, it is not God destroying these cities Himself, but He did see everything happen—by free will of man himself. Now Isaiah asks God whether He is willing to restrain Himself from doing anything and to let even more of His own people be killed? The answer is *no*. God says in Isaiah 65:6-7 that He will take action, though perhaps differently than expected. 

As for the second question, will He keep silent? We know the answer from history. The answer is *yes* here, though not forever. God would keep silent for 400 years because the Israelites needed this affliction. It was perhaps the only, but most certainly the best way to teach the Israelites to stay away from idols. 
The best way could be for a man (or woman) to let him be with his mistress, so that he realizes the good of his own wife.
