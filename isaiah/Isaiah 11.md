# Isaiah 11
*Isaiah 11 (NIV) 1 A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse;*
*from his roots a Branch will bear fruit.*
*2 The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him—*
*the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding,*
*the Spirit of counsel and of might,*
*the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the Lord—*
*3 and he will delight in the fear of the Lord.*

Remember that this is a prophecy about the Messiah that was still to come and this is the description of Him. We now know in hindsight that it is a perfect match with Jesus' person. This Messiah would have God's wisdom, understanding, counsel and might, knowledge and fear of the Lord and delight in it. 
Indeed Jesus showed His fear for the Lord. Not that Jesus has to be afraid of the Lord, because He *is* the Lord and He has nothing to be afraid of because He has done nothing wrong. But He still showed in His life what a person's life should look like if he were afraid of God. By analogy, Jesus showed us how to tiptoe in order not to wake up someone. Jesus showed us what it is like to live under God's Law and revere God and not only showing fear, but also love for His Law. Even more, He showed us how we can delight in this fear, because it is His Law that keeps us safe and have more joy and peace within these boundaries than anything else can give us. 

*He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes,*
*or decide by what he hears with his ears;*
*4 but with righteousness he will judge the needy,*
*with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth.*
*He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth;*
*with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked.*
*5 Righteousness will be his belt*
*and faithfulness the sash around his waist.*

What Jesus showed us as an example is not to judge with His eyes or ears. We are the complete opposite of that. We often judge even before we have seen or heard the whole story, and even when know the *whole* story, we can only judge by what we know. How can we judge through anything else than our eyes and ears? We cannot read minds and feelings like Jesus can, but for sure that is what Jesus longs from us, that we do not only judge with our minds, but with our hearts as well. 
How does Jesus judge then? He judges with righteousness and justice—both the good and the bad. In other words, He *does* something for the poor and needy, something they need, which is the righteousness due to them, because of the wicked's treatment of them and their oppression. 

*6 The wolf will live with the lamb,*
*the leopard will lie down with the goat,*
*the calf and the lion and the yearling together;*
*and a little child will lead them.*
*7 The cow will feed with the bear,*
*their young will lie down together,*
*and the lion will eat straw like the ox.*
*8 The infant will play near the cobra’s den,*
*and the young child will put its hand into the viper’s nest.*
*9 They will neither harm nor destroy*
*on all my holy mountain,*
*for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord*
*as the waters cover the sea.*

As strange as it sounds that the wolf and the lamb lie together or all the other things described above, this is perfectly normal when people and animals have the knowledge of the Lord. This knowledge does not only consist of knowing God, but it also means that you know His love, you have experienced it. Once you have experienced it, you will start doing good to others, for love is more powerful than anything else and it is a force, if I may say so, that drives us. 
Perhaps a bad analogy, but someone who has experienced drugs before feels the need of it after its effect has worn out. He will want to feel this feeling again, but out of a selfish longing. With love it is the other way around, if someone wants to love, it is by definition not selfish, because love is self-sacrificing. A person who wants to be a parent wants to give love to a child. A person who wants to marry, wants to serve his or her spouse. But once anyone has directly felt this love of God, which is so much more powerful than the love of people—which is only a reflection of the love of God—he will want to give this love to others. 

*10 In that day the Root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples; the nations will rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious. 11 In that day the Lord will reach out his hand a second time to reclaim the surviving remnant of his people from Assyria, from Lower Egypt, from Upper Egypt, from Cush, from Elam, from Babylonia, from Hamath and from the islands of the Mediterranean.*

The day will come that Jesus will be the symbol of all people. A symbol of hope, of His as the Savior. Whatever flag there is with whatever meaning, the symbol Jesus will imply more. The Dutch and French flag, for example, has three colors that stand for three values, *fraternity*, *equality* and ...
#todo/opzoeken  paternity?
All these three are rooted in Christianity, but Christ is more than just those three. Christ is the core of all good, which is rooted in love, righteousness and mercy. 
Christ Himself is rooted in love and out of love come these three values. One can even say that the American constitution is rooted in love, although that might require some context. 
So if this banner is a flag that stands for all countries, then yes, Jesus alone stands for all the good in the world. 

*12 He will raise a banner for the nations*
*and gather the exiles of Israel;*
*he will assemble the scattered people of Judah*
*from the four quarters of the earth.*

A banner is also meant to be seen from afar, signaling a message, sometimes a message of war and at other times a message of hope, depending on the situation and on what the country stands for. When Jews see the banner that Christ raises they will see that He is their salvation. He is the source of all their country is built on, the Word in flesh, which is also the source of their culture, their life and their purpose.
Jews from all over the world *will* see one day that Jesus is King and they will gather. Back then, the Jews were not vastly spread around the world. Perhaps some had gone as far as neighboring countries, but most certainly not as far as East-Asia or America. But God has spread them all around the world through the Assyrian dispersion, although I do not know whether these Jews remembered their roots after a few generations.

And once more did God allow a dispersion when the Jews fled Israel after the Jewish Revolt, perhaps so that the Jewish culture, not the outward appearances, but the love from God in the first place, and the love for God second, would be shown throughout their culture. 
Instead, however, the Jewish people kept their cultural celebrations to themselves as an exclusivity, excluding others and stirring up hate, while they were supposed to make other peoples jealous of them. The Jews made a lot of money, but kept it to themselves, stirring up envy. Jews have invented many things as scientists which have helped many people as well. There are many Jews who have won Nobel prizes for Economics and for Physics. A lot of good has come from them, though unknowingly, because they merely did research for their own gain, not to benefit people. 
If they had spent the money they are so good at earning at on the people, they would have caused a lot of admiration for where this talent and intelligence is coming from. Instead of envy and hatred, the world would see the physical proof of God's protection and blessing over His people.

*13 Ephraim’s jealousy will vanish,*
*and Judah’s enemies will be destroyed;*
*Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah,*
*nor Judah hostile toward Ephraim.*

#biblestudy/prophecy/fulfilled One of the promises that God made was that there would not be enmity between the north and the south of Israel anymore. There still was, even 700 years later, when Jesus' discipled wondered why He did not circumvented Samaria in order to go to Galilee. Even though this only lasted until 66 AD, and Jews only returned to Israel about 1900 years later, in 1945 after the Second World War, there has not been enmity anymore between the north and the south ever since. Granted, there has been enmity between Arabs and Jews, and most of these live in the areas described in the next verses, Philistia in the west and Nazareth in the north. 
#todo/opzoeken What was the exact location of Samaria? Why was Galilee not part of Samaria, of the part invaded by the Assyrians and mixed with Assyrians?

*14 They will swoop down on the slopes of Philistia to the west;*
*together they will plunder the people to the east.*
*They will subdue Edom and Moab,*
*and the Ammonites will be subject to them.*

This is still something that the Israelites have not done completely. They have not completely obtained the slopes of Philistia to the west, which is probably the Gaza Strip. Although they own it, they do not or cannot remove the Arabs living there. In the east Edom and Moab, which are now the country of Jordan, are not subdued by Israel either. Israel's territory has decreased significantly between 66 AD and 1945. 
#todo/opzoeken  where is Edom now, do people live there? Jordan, of course. 
Though literally, they have not subdued these countries or places, the meaning of this verse is that Israel will not be subject to them anymore, but the other way around. This too has become reality in the present. #biblestudy/prophecy/fulfilled Israel is now the most powerful country in the Middle-East. It may not have the same capital as Saudi-Arabia (I do not know, perhaps it does have), but in terms of education, life expectancy, literacy and economy it definitely stands on top. 
Either way, they are not subject to them. Rather yet, Israel is even helping out Jordan with irrigation techniques to save water, so that the people of Jordan can irrigate their fields. They need the technology and knowledge of Israel on this field. 

*15 The Lord will dry up*
*the gulf of the Egyptian sea;*
*with a scorching wind he will sweep his hand*
*over the Euphrates River.*
*He will break it up into seven streams*
*so that anyone can cross over in sandals.*

This prophecy will be fulfilled, for this has not taken place yet. But a symbolic meaning is behind this verse as well. Where the Euphrates is a natural border between Iraq and another place, this border will fade away. 
What happens before this is—according to MacArthur's Study Bible Notes, cf. Revelations 16:12)—a heating of the Earth, melting the ice caps of Mount Ararat and swamping the valley, making it impossible for the eastern army to start the war at Armageddon. Note that this eastern *confederacy*, as it is called, is deemed to be [China](http://www.christiandataresources.com/easternconfederacy.htm) but could be India as well with over 1 billion people.  
So the meaning is that a border will disappear, but it will lead to a war as well. 

#todo/opzoeken  Note on Revelation 16:12. What is the Eastern Confederacy? 

*16 There will be a highway for the remnant of his people*
*that is left from Assyria,*
*as there was for Israel*
*when they came up from Egypt.*

Because the border has disappeared, there will now be a highway for God's people to cross from Assyria over the Euphrates river to Israel, just like they had to cross the Red Sea in order to go to Israel from Egypt. 
However, at the moment of writing the Jews captured by Assyria have already spread to the rest of the world and the war at Armageddon is still to come. Does that mean that the descendants of these northern tribe Jews will still come back to Israel at this final war? #biblestudy/questions
