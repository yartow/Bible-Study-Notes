# Isaiah 15
**Isaiah 15 (NIV) A Prophecy Against Moab**
*16:6-12pp — Jer 48:29-36*
*1 A prophecy against Moab:*
*Ar in Moab is ruined,*
*destroyed in a night!*
*Kir in Moab is ruined,*
*destroyed in a night!*

If God wants to destroy something, He can do it in the shortest time possible. The fact He destroyed Ar and Kir in a night, is only a sign of God's great grace. If this city has been destroyed over a night, many people still had time to flee the earthquake or fire or whatever the disaster was.

*2 Dibon goes up to its temple,*
*to its high places to weep;*
*Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba.*

Even when they are testifying of such greatness of God, they do not realize it is God Who did this and that it was to punish them. For still they go up to the temple of their idols, most probably to ask them for help and to find comfort there. They do not realize they were actually the source of his disaster. 

*Every head is shaved*
*and every beard cut off.*
*3 In the streets they wear sackcloth;*
*on the roofs and in the public squares*
*they all wail,*
*prostrate with weeping.*
*4 Heshbon and Elealeh cry out,*
*their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz.*
*Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out,*
*and their hearts are faint.*

God realizes how much this hurts the people. No matter how hard-hearted they were, towards poor people and towards God, and no matter how cruel they were in the idolatrous practices, they still had feelings, if only for their family and friends. 

*5 My heart cries out over Moab;*
*her fugitives flee as far as Zoar,*
*as far as Eglath Shelishiyah.*

Of all those hurt, God Himself is hurt most, for He loves all of us more than we can ever love anyone or everyone combined. For all love comes from God, He is the source of all love. Without God's love, we would not have any love in us. 
The total amount of love we have for others plus the love for ourselves, is the amount of love God has given us. As long as we keep giving to others, God will replenish us with new love. But when we give to ourselves, we are taking from the love that was meant for others, and love that is used in this way, will not be replenished. 
The selfish person will therefore run out of love at one point and take love from others, which can result in narcissism.

But as soon as this person is fully out of love, he will not even have love for himself anymore nor for life itself, and start the road towards suicide, killing himself slowly by drinking himself to death, or in faster ways. 
Not only the party you give love to makes a big difference, but the way you use it as well. One can say that the "burn rate" of love is different. You can use love in a slow and fast way. 
Take for example candle wax and kerosene. Kerosene burns a lot faster, but runs out faster as well, while candles give little warmth, but can burn a lot longer. They are both used for different purposes and both are needed. 
#todo/opzoeken Why do airplanes use kerosene instead of gasoline?

Or take another example, money. Money can be used to buy material things like gifts and drugs, which will give you an endorphinic rush, but money can also be used to buy food which the body needs to stay alive.
An expensive meal might taste better, but it is better to continually keep eating than to have one big meal for yourself and nothing else after that.

Will the love used for yourself—when used wisely, slowly—be replenished? Surely God will not blame us for using His love for our own bodies. Rather yet, God commands us through Paul in 1 Corinthians 6:18 to love our own bodies as God's temple and to keep it holy and to abstain from all kinds of sexual immorality.
But the question was not whether God blames us, but whether He replenishes this love we used. Let us suppose He does not replenish any love used for ourselves. How then do we obtain enough love for ourselves? In the same way money works. 
If you have only 1 euro left, you can buy a loaf of bread, eat and die, like the widow was planning before she encountered Elisha the prophet. Or you can set this 1 euro to work, sell whatever you can buy with this euro and make more money. Another way is to borrow money and do business. 
With love it is the same. Give whatever you have left, no matter how little, and God will multiply the love you have. No person has ever said he does not have enough love to give, because he has given away too much. Only those who have given too much to themselves can say they do not have enough love to give to others, because they simply have none of it left. 
In the example of a person on the brink of suicide, who does not have a single grain of love for himself anymore, note that it sometimes *seems* like that, but in fact, there always is a little bit left. Some people can, in their last moments before they want to jump off a bridge, for example, pity and love another person, say, a beggar on the street, and gather from this act enough love to change their mind. 

Also note that codependent people are of another class. They give so much love to others that they do not have any love left for themselves. They even give away the portion that was meant for themselves. 
They have in fact, lots of love, accumulated from the large amounts they have given away over the past, but their own self is so severely worn out (devastated) that they need to love their self for a long time. The amount is not crucial, but time is and to heal their self they will need to learn to change their behavior as well.

*They go up the hill to Luhith,*
*weeping as they go;*
*on the road to Horonaim*
*they lament their destruction.*
*6 The waters of Nimrim are dried up*
*and the grass is withered;*
*the vegetation is gone*
*and nothing green is left.*

God's work is thorough, and so is His work of destruction. He can destroy things people cannot do. Surely, the Romans burned down a city and threw salt on it, so never could ever grow there again, but that is easy. Anyone can do that. 
God can make the waters of Nimrim, a river or a lake, dry up and make all vegetation disappear. Who can make everything that grows out of the ground disappear? Nobody, that is. 

*7 So the wealth they have acquired and stored up*
*they carry away over the Ravine of the Poplars.*

Still, after seeing all this and after all this heart-cry, it seems the surviving people have not changed. They are still being referred to as "the wealth" and not even "the people of Moab" or "the surviving family members". It is the wealth that is of importance here. It is of importance to them. And now they are leaving these places, because they can no longer live there. 
The reasons for this are several, in my opinion. They would need to start building up the city from scratch. Perhaps they did not want to do that or they were not capable of doing that. Imagine a group of wealthy Wall Street brokers being left with the remains of Manhattan. Do they have the carpentry and engineering skills to build up the city?
Another reason is that the surrounding cities were devastated as well, and a city does not work well when there are not other cities to commute to and do business with. A third reason—of course—is that God has rendered the city uninhabitable by drying up Nimrim.
Now their wealth is a burden to them. Not only do they have lots of it, they had even stored up lots of it, so the burden becomes bigger. Also, they need to descent into a ravine—and climb out of there later again—which is heavy with all their wealth carried on their backs or on the backs of their cattle.
In other words, they have left what was truly dear to them—their family and friends first, their city second—and are left with the one thing that was dear to them but was also one of the main causes of inflicting the wrath of God upon themselves. And now they are stuck with it and their treasure has become a burden for them.

*8 Their outcry echoes along the border of Moab;*
*their wailing reaches as far as Eglaim,*
*their lamentation as far as Beer Elim.*

I do not know how far Eglaim and Beer Elim are, but it is probably near the border of Moab. Moab was not such a big country, but every person killed is one too many and deserves an outcry. People were killed all over the while country of Moab, even up to the borders. Or perhaps it is not that people at the border actually died, but that the people who died had relatives all the way up to the border. 
In any case, the wail was exceedingly high, mourning was all over. The worst natural disaster in our age would have been small compared to this war, if Isaiah is speaking of a war that killed people. The worst one in our age would be the earthquake in China that killed a 100,000 or more, though not officially published, and the worst war in a single country would be Rwanda, where a million people were murdered, but what the Babylonians do is far worse. 
#todo/opzoeken How many killed in Rwanda?  
A few years prior the Moabites had probably been struck by the Assyrian invasion and now again by Babylonians. If not only fathers, in the previous invasion, but now children as well, who have grown up to be men, are killed, how many people will there be left then? Children do not even get to grow up and have their own children in such a short time span. 

*9 The waters of Dimon are full of blood,*
*but I will bring still more upon Dimon—*
*a lion upon the fugitives of Moab*
*and upon those who remain in the land.*

But still, the Lord's wrath has not subsided, for even the surviving ones, whether in or out of the country, will be taken care of.
God's hate for the Moabites is so great, because the love for His children is even greater and Moabites tried to destroy His children. But God's love for the Moabites is great as well and that is why he has slain the Assyrians and will slay the Babylonians as well.
