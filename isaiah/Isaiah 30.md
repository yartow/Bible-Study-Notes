# Isaiah 30

**Woe to the Obstinate Nation**
*1 “Woe to the obstinate children,”*
*declares the Lord,*
*“to those who carry out plans that are not mine,*
*forming an alliance, but not by my Spirit,*
*heaping sin upon sin;*
*2 who go down to Egypt*
*without consulting me;*
*who look for help to Pharaoh’s protection,*
*to Egypt’s shade for refuge.*
*3 But Pharaoh’s protection will be to your shame,*
*Egypt’s shade will bring you disgrace.*

God's children, which are the Jews, are obstinate, they are stubborn and unwilling to change. They have plans for themselves and sometimes, if ever so rarely, they coincide with God's plans so they say they are doing God's will and doing what is written in His Word. But their intentions are wrong. Their purpose is wrong. They are doing it for themselves, never intending to do God's will. 
They want to be saved from the Assyrians, and yes, that is what God wants to, but He wants it to happen through humility for God. God wants to do it Himself, and the Jews want to do it themselves. They had rather humble themselves for Egypt than for God—rather for those people from whom they fled, who killed thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of them during the killing of babies in Moses' time. 
Why did they do such an illogical thing? Why would they rather go to an enemy an incur a debt which extremely high rent, when they could just ask their father, God? Is it because they did not want to humble themselves? No, because they had to humble themselves either way, either to God or to Egypt. 
It is because Egypt required from them only material things and promises; perhaps to give them gold and a number of wives, or even services through labor or knowledge. But God asked them not those things, but to give to Him their hearts—all of it—and that is what the Jews found harder to do than their possessions. 
Everything comes out of the heart, eventually—whether good or bad things, lust and love, they are all from the heart. It is like asking an alcoholic to give up on alcohol or a nicotine addict to quit smoking, or even worse, asking someone to stop eating sugar and salt. The latter is hard even for those who are not addicted to food. Nobody *wants* to do those things. Those are the things that give pleasure to life. 
Of course the addicted person does not know any better—at that moment and stage of life—and only knows that that feeling of taking this substance to him—whether drugs, nicotine, sugar or alcohol—is the greatest feeling he can get. He does not know that his brain has been hijacked by that stuff. Yet God knows that there is a greater feeling than all of those which comes forth out of love. It is the feeling of *knowing God*. 
Truly, where I have seen people converting to Christianity in an instance, it was because they saw a glimpse of God. Of the many testimonies I have heard or conversions I have seen in movies, the converted Christians had a feeling of love from God, His righteousness which let them feel they were sinful, but at the same time His mercy that forgave them and His grace that granted them a new life. This combined feeling is *knowing God*—although that is much too big a word to use for what it actually is. It is only a reflection of a reflection, and so on. God is too big to comprehend with our five senses and our thoughts or feelings, but He shows Himself in this way and only one taste of it, one sniff of the scent of Jesus Christ, is enough to convert someone to Christianity and to pull away from all other addictions. 
Now the Jews were still in that addicted phase—perhaps they still are. They can only see what is good, but not what is perfect. *It is good to be set free from the Assyrians, but it is better to have an only temporary debt to the Egyptians than an eternal debt to God.* That is what they were thinking.
We will see later on in Isaiah what consequences this had for their relationship with God and for the rest of their people. It is the leaders of the nations who led the people into such dismay!

#church/material voorbeeld van 50k geven aan iemand terwijl hij 50k schuld staat, of als hij 0 schuld staat. Is een verschil! Dit is het verschil tussen mercy en grace.

*4 Though they have officials in Zoan*
*and their envoys have arrived in Hanes,*
*5 everyone will be put to shame*
*because of a people useless to them,*
*who bring neither help nor advantage,*
*but only shame and disgrace. ”*

I am not sure whether it is the Egyptians or the Jews that had officials in Zoan or in other places, but what is certain is that the Egyptians were useless to the Jews. They may have thought they could stand up against the Assyrians, but they were as easily defeated as all the countries before them.
Now the Jews had humiliated themselves before the Egyptians, but to no avail, for they could not help them. God shamed the Jews in this way. Could they return to God? Yes of course they could, but they felt too ashamed to do so. They had rather find another place to hide and seek, if only there was one, one not subdued by the Assyrian threat. 

*6 A prophecy concerning the animals of the Negev:*
*Through a land of hardship and distress,*
*of lions and lionesses,*
*of adders and darting snakes,*
*the envoys carry their riches on donkeys’ backs,*
*their treasures on the humps of camels,*
*to that unprofitable nation,*
*7 to Egypt, whose help is utterly useless.*
*Therefore I call her*
*Rahab the Do-Nothing.*
*8 Go now, write it on a tablet for them,*
*inscribe it on a scroll,*
*that for the days to come*
*it may be an everlasting witness.*

God has been merciful to Egypt, He has kept it alive so that *it*—perhaps denoted on purpose with "it", a sexless participle, instead of "he" or "she", because it is not worth being associated with anything human—will be an everlasting witness. 
Indeed, we see throughout history that Egypt has stayed alive. The pharaohs of Egypt have been witness of Joseph's ruling, although the presence of the Israelites in Egypt either has been blotted out of their history, out of shame, and Joseph's name is unrecognizable to us because he had an Egyptian name—but speculations have been made of some [vizier (sage/viceroy)](http://creationwiki.org/Joseph_and_Imhotep) who might have been Joseph.
Whereas so many countries have disappeared from history, leaving only sparse traces of their civilization, from Edom and Moab, to the land of the Hittites and even Babylon and Persia, Egypt has survived, its pyramids have stayed intact and the country has always been known throughout the ancient world. That is a promise God made, because they had the task of being the witness of how the Israelites were looking for help with them, only to be rejected. 
Why did God keep Egypt alive? He could have buried Egypt, like He has done with Assyria and Babylonia, and let someone dig up old traces on tablets or scrolls proving that the Israelites had indeed looked for help with the Egyptians. But God chose to do it this way and His way is best, for His way is sovereign. The Jews, after all, are not a people that have been dug up, like the Assyrians. No, they have always lived, though spread across the world, they have known their roots—that is, being the children of God and the children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—and their geographical roots, which is Egypt and Israel. 
Since Israel did not exist anymore—perhaps it was even removed from the map for a while and renamed by the Ottomans and Muslims or other peoples that invaded the land—they still had Egypt as proof of their existence. 
The Jews have always been able to say—even if Israel did not exist anymore: *Even though we do not have proof that Israel exists, it might be buried under the sand, we know that the stories of our fathers are true, for Egypt is a witness of it.*

*9 For these are rebellious people, deceitful children,*
*children unwilling to listen to the Lord’s instruction.*
*10 They say to the seers,*
::*“See no more visions !”*::
*and to the prophets,*
*“Give us no more visions of what is right!*
*Tell us pleasant things,*
*prophesy illusions.*
*11 Leave this way,*
*get off this path,*
*and stop confronting us*
*with the Holy One of Israel!”*

In history we see that prophets and ministers are proclaiming the good news and instructions for the abundant life, which is to follow God. That is, the instructions are to follow God and the abundant life means having a relationship with God. We also see this culminating in certain periods where Christianity grew, with ups and downs though, in the United States for example. Unfortunately, secularism grew as well and started during the Industrial Revolution, where economic welfare started to rise in 1900s and grew even harder in the 50s getting pushed to grow even faster by music, sexual revolutions and drugs in the 70s. By then it was normal to push the boundaries of morality or to cross it, to show how tough you were, as a way of rebellion. From a certain age, say puberty, people wanted to follow the world. 
By the new millennium, when we thought things could not get worse, they got worse. Not only was everyone already breaking all the rules, but now the moral rules were gone. Moral definitions changed and what was bad now is good. Not only that, but these bad rules were taught to children as being good. Even the age barrier is gone. 
Where the sexual activities in the 70s were a revolution, even to adults, such as free sex and the rise of porn movies, in the 2000s they are normal, and by 2010 they are taught in elementary schools. Condoms are being spread to eight year-old children and taught how to use them. 
Can it be any worse? *Yes it can.* (Note that this is a pun to Obama's first campaign slogan *Yes, we can*. The reason for reference to Obama is that the worst (sexual) immoral transgressions of God's Law happened under the Obama administration.) Children are taught that sex and gender are two different things. They are taught that it is perfectly normal to be born "in the wrong body", with a gender in its mind which is different from the sex, to be a boy trapped inside a woman's body or the other way around; they are taught that is normal and that homosexuality is normal. They are taught that we shouldn't distinguish between men and women anymore, because there are an indefinite number of different genders, coined as the *gender spectrum*, where any person can be in between. Some are even different genders at different times of the day, which is called *gender fluidity*.
They are taught that it is not a problem in their minds and that they should deal with the problem—because there is no problem—but that they should fix their body by getting operated. 
All the while persecution of Christians is increasing because of their different stance and the "intolerance" for the LGBTQ community. (Note that this abbreviation is getting longer by the minute. It is made up of 30 different characters right now, for all different "gender types" within the spectrum, including people who have undergone a full and a partial sex surgery, i.e. without surgery on the reproductive organs.)

*12 Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel says:*
*“Because you have rejected this message,*
*relied on oppression*
*and depended on deceit,*
*13 this sin will become for you*
*like a high wall, cracked and bulging,*
*that collapses suddenly, in an instant.*
*14 It will break in pieces like pottery,*
*shattered so mercilessly*
*that among its pieces not a fragment will be found*
::*for taking coals from a hearth*::
*or scooping water out of a cistern.”*

This is quite a difficult depiction the punishment God is going to give the obstinate nation. #todo/opzoeken  People. Perhaps it is people instead of nation, because I am thinking—again—about the Left here in the United States. Would this punishment be on the non-Leftists as well? 
It is #todo/opzoeken  frappant to see that God is using a *wall* here as the symbol of their punishment—although this wall will break. In actuality, the building of this wall that Trump wants is actually their punishment, because that will stop the flow of new immigrants, it will stop the return of deported immigrants and it will require immigrants to work and integrate and behave like good Americans, before they get a permit to stay. This will heavily impact their voters because the Democrats will then not be able to do much for immigrants anymore. 
Aside from this wall, the symbolic meaning of the wall is a protection for this nation, and God is saying now that this protection will break, it will shatter so mercilessly that there will not even be rocks under which they can hide. The pieces of the wall will be so small (as broken pottery) that they cannot even use it to take coals out of a hearth or scoop water out of a cistern. 
I understand how a sharve #todo/opzoeken scherf in het Engels, is concave and can be used to scoop water, but why would anyone use these to take coals out of a hearth? Would not a stick be more practical? But that is aside from the theological aspect.  

The protection of the Jews would be gone. Egypt could not help them nor could any other country. As for God, He was watching them and the Assyrians, the Babylonians and the Persians to see that they did not go too far. That is protection, but only minimally, not enough for the Jews to be thankful for. 
Yes, this wall broke down for all Jews, even the good ones, although God spared the righteous ones by letting them or their children return to Israel. How about the Israelites in Israel, captured by the Assyrians? Only God knows what happened to those righteous one, but one thing is for sure, *God is righteous* and He would not allow unrighteousness to happen under His hand. 

*15 This is what the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One of Israel, says:*
*“In repentance and rest is your salvation,*
::*in quietness and trust is your strength,*:: #todo/opzoeken referentie van Still (Don Moen)?

God wants to give us so much, He wants to give us real love, real pleasure, real quietness and rest and real strength. It comes in other forms than we can imagine. We think that love comes passively, that somebody will love upon us. We think that pleasure is fun and that the longer and more euphoric it takes place, the better it is. We think that rest is equal to holidays and strength is equal to energy and the amount one has done.
But God is saying *no* to all these things. That is not how He intended us to enjoy life. 
Real love does not come through receiving love, it comes through giving, because only then you will know the value of love. One can not truly appreciate something when he has not done it himself. You cannot truly appreciate what your parents have done for you, if you have not been a parent yourself. You cannot truly appreciate one's cooking, if you have never cooked yourself and know how hard it is. The same goes for love. Someone can love upon you, but you will not feel loved, you might even be insensitive to it if you have been  spoiled all of your life. But you will understand when you start loving someone yourself and know how hard it is to love the unloveable. 
Real pleasure does not come from partying and fairs. These are fun because they are not happening all the time. If we had Christmas everyday it would not be fun anymore. Somehow worldly people do not understand this simple phenomenon. Things are fun because one does not have them. But they want to party two times every weekend and still have the feeling they once had at the very beginning. Because they do not have this feeling they take drugs and more alcohol to get this feeling again, which they get in some sense, but with many side-effects. Better said, they do not get a pleasant feeling, but they numb out their negative feelings through alcohol and drugs. 
These people have no reason to celebrate. They want to party because they like the good feelings. Christians get to celebrate Christmas because Christ has dealt with the negative parts. That is a good reason to celebrate. The world wants to have these feelings as well, but can only cover the negative parts, because they have no Savior.

So, summarizing, there are two reasons why people do not get the "good feelings", the peace, Christians have. 
People have *tasted* this peace before—not meaning they were Christians but not now anymore, but meaning that know a little bit of what it is like to have this feeling of Christian peace—at least some, and I think many, have felt this during a party, and they want to have this feeling again. So they are relating this feeling of peace with parties.
[reference to the Wedding Crashers]
[I too had this feeling my first time at Asian Parties, although it was more because of the attention I got than the party itself.]

However, there two reasons why this feeling does not return. The first reason is the *reason to celebrate*. If you are happy at a birthday party it is because it is someone's birthday! If you want to be happy and you hold a birthday or graduation party without anyone actually having a birthday or having graduated, you will get very mixed feelings at this party. 
The second reason is the *habituation* factor.

How do Christians get this peace?
Christians always have a reason to celebrate, because Christ has died for. 
Second, we do not do this every day, in part because there is work to do. But God has given us many days to remember parts of His salvation. At Christmas we celebrate the beginning, at Easter we celebrate His accomplishment, and at Pentecost we celebrate the consequence of this. At the same time there is room for mourning, in the Silent Week we commemorate White Thursday and Good Friday. 


Because they have nothing to feel good about, and the negative parts are [overstijgen] the positive ones, they can only numb out everything and simulate 
#todo/opzoeken  difference between simulate and emulate
positive feelings through substances, which sometimes contain endorphins. 
The second reason why they do not feel positive, is because they party too often. The secret of excitement, however, lies in the *infrequency* of partying. 
#church/material 

*but you would have none of it.*
*16 You said, ‘No, we will flee on horses.’*
*Therefore you will flee!*
*You said, ‘We will ride off on swift horses.’*
*Therefore your pursuers will be swift!*

So real peace comes from resting in God and real pleasure comes out of this peace. For who can have fun without peace of mind? Some cannot even enjoy food when they do not have peace in their hearts and/or minds. 
Note that in Chinese the heart and the mind are almost equal. If one says "I was thinking to myself", then in Chinese this would be "I was thinking in my heart"; If one would say "What do you feel in your heart?", in Chinese this would also be in the heart. So the heart is used for both feeling and thinking. #todo/opzoeken  correct? 
This kind of peace the world does not desire. They desire fun and excitement, regardless of having peace. They have problems to be fixed, problems that cause this unrest, but instead of fixing it, they escape it by ignoring them and trying to have fun. This will not solve the problem. 
They are attacking the symptoms. The symptom is that they are not having fun, but they should not fix that, but the cause of what is eating their fun away, which is unrest.

In the same way the Jews in the South and the Israelites in the North—though in this verse it is probably about the Israelites—are not fixing the problem, or better said, looking up the One Who can fix it, but they are fixing the symptom. The problem is that they are disobedient to God, the solution is to repent and call on God, the symptoms are the present threats and the oncoming attacks of the Assyrians.
If the Jews are so willing to use their solution, that is fleeing, then God will let them use their solution. But know that God had a much better solution in mind. 

*17 A thousand will flee*
*at the threat of one;*
*at the threat of five*
*you will all flee away,*
*till you are left*
*like a flagstaff on a mountaintop,*
*like a banner on a hill.”*

The Jews were so persistent in their plans that they were planning to flee no matter what. Most probably even if there was only one Assyrian coming, a messenger to make peace, they would have fled. 
So persistent are the evolutionists in keeping their theory. They will claim this as the truth, because they believe in it, they presume it, not because they have proven it, but because they refuse to accept any other theory. Even if a famed evolutionist and atheist professor on *their* side would say he has found something the *might* prove the evolution theory wrong, and provide for another theory that still excludes God, they would still reject that theory. They will do everything in their power that is not included in the theory or in the extrapolation thereof.
And they will overreact. Like the Jews would flee for the threat of one, so the evolutionists will take everything out of their closet for even the smallest threat of their enemies, the creationists. That only shows how powerless they are. That is because they know, not even deep inside their hearts, but already in their minds, that evolution has many gaps and holes and the theory is not even doubtfully true, it is completely untrue. Most artifacts and proofs on which the theory is based do not even exist. It has never been proven that some bones belonged to ape-like men and that bones found hundreds of meters or even further apart belonged to the same "person" or even kind. 
There is no proof that all the bones of the found homo sapiens are in the same age range. This method of carbon dating can only go back to 10.000 years, but this depends on the circumstances in which people lived. 

*18 Yet the Lord longs to be gracious to you;*
*therefore he will rise up to show you compassion.*
::*For the Lord is a God of justice.*::
*Blessed are all who wait for him!*

This justice will be applied to evolutionists as well. They will be shown compassion. But what will be required of them? Will they be shown compassion while they keep spreading their lies? 
Those who wait for him, yes, they will be shown justice. We, Christians, will be shown justice. Our enemies will be punished and we will be shown compassion for all of our mistakes. 
I cannot wait for the day that the evolution theory is cracked and all books have to be rewritten. The day that it will finally become clear that the geological column is a myth, that no proof has ever found for the existence of that, that most if not all of the layers ever found on Earth *disprove* this column, and circle-reasoning has taken place, which has placed all fossils in certain categorie and that these taxonomies must be changed in the school books as well. 

*19 People of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. How gracious he will be when you cry for help! As soon as he hears, he will answer you. 20 Although the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, your teachers will be hidden no more; with your own eyes you will see them. 21 Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way; walk in it.” 22 Then you will desecrate your idols overlaid with silver and your images covered with gold; you will throw them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them, “Away with you! ”*

There will be a time when those in Jerusalem will cry no more and they will call unto the Lord. The Jews right now in Israel are far from God and it is only by tradition that some choose the path of orthodoxy and become a rabbi, which is only now state-subsidized. It will take a lot before they will believe in and call on God, even though they—of all people—are the ones who have the most right to stand on this promise and they—of all people—*should* believe their own ancestry. 
No other people has an ancestry as clear and as known by other people's as theirs, and as influential on the world in both the academic (and scientific) field as well as philosophically and morally. Where other people and peoples are trying to find out their ancestry, the Jews have this knowledge readily available. Yet the sad thing is, they often do not even know about it themselves. They do not know that their only—or most important—power and right to existence lies in a museum, behind a [etalage] #todo/opzoeken containing the Qumran scrolls, which proves that at the time of the creation of these scrolls, around 100 AD, before the arrival of the Islam, around 500 AD, Israel belonged to the Jews. This is their proof. 
But there will be a time when the Jews will recognize who their real teacher is, that is God, their Father in Heaven and the Maker of Heaven and Earth (cf. Psalm 121) and if I interpret this part correctly, this means the Holy Spirit will come upon them and whisper or say—although the "behind" part indicates that the message is not as straightforward as it would be when it is "in front of them"—which way to go. 
And though unimaginable at this very time, they—and we as well—will throw away our idols that are covered with gold. We will throw away our most precious materialist possessions in return for a relationship with God. 
This is especially unimaginable because God will give them—and applicable to us as well—the food of adversity and water of affliction. People are not praising right now while we are in the Golden Age of technology, it has never been as comfortable as it is right now, where food is available almost 24 hours a day, delivered to our house and without doing the action of paying, but simply letting be deducted from your creditcard. Or even simpler, by telling Siri, Alexa or Google you want to eat something, you do not even need to pick up your phone or open your app, but just speak to your Echo, Google Home or Apple listening device in your house. We are not listening to God in this day and with this comfort, how can we ever listen to Him in the depths of our physical and materialistic misery? 
This is possible through one thing only, that thing which Paul speaks of, *I have learned to be content in any and every situation, whether living in plenty or in want.* And this power comes through the Holy Spirit. 

*23 He will also send you rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful. In that day your cattle will graze in broad meadows. 24 The oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat fodder and mash, spread out with fork and shovel. 25 In the day of great slaughter, when the towers fall, streams of water will flow on every high mountain and every lofty hill. 26 The moon will shine like the sun, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven full days, when the Lord binds up the bruises of his people and heals the wounds he inflicted.*

The Lord, however, will be graceful at the same time. Though toil, adversity and affliction will be part of our "fate", God will restore the land. There will be great slaughter and great pain, but there will be great healing as well, for those who survive.
What will happen if the sun starts shining seven times as bright as it is right now? If the atmosphere's protection stays as it is, it might kill us or shorten our lives, but perhaps it will intensify our lives as well. Aside from the heat—which makes us lazy—it will make us much delighted as well. The cold countries will be glad to receive this sun all year long, but for hot countries this will be disastrous. 
The emphasis is on the healing effect, though, in my opinion. 

*27 See, the Name of the Lord comes from afar,*
*with burning anger and dense clouds of smoke;*
*his lips are full of wrath,*
*and his tongue is a consuming fire.*
*28 His breath is like a rushing torrent,*
*rising up to the neck.*

God has been patient for a very long time with the Assyrians, allowing them to win only to punish the Israelites, but it did not take long or the Assyrians went too far. In all their winnings they did not see the hand of God on them. Neither wh

*He shakes the nations in the sieve of destruction;*
*he places in the jaws of the peoples*
*a bit that leads them astray.*
*29 And you will sing*
*as on the night you celebrate a holy festival;*
*your hearts will rejoice*
*as when people playing pipes go up*
*to the mountain of the Lord,*
*to the Rock of Israel.*
*30 The Lord will cause people to hear his majestic voice*
*and will make them see his arm coming down*
*with raging anger and consuming fire,*
*with cloudburst, thunderstorm and hail.*
*31 The voice of the Lord will shatter Assyria;*
*with his rod he will strike them down.*
*32 Every stroke the Lord lays on them*
*with his punishing club*
*will be to the music of timbrels and harps,*
*as he fights them in battle with the blows of his arm.*

What a spectacle this must have been. God fulfilled His promise to defeat Assyria. Something He promised in Isaiah but fulfilled many years later (about a hundred, in my estimation) #todo/opzoeken 
Something that was deemed impossible at the time, but God still did. He destroyed them not in silence, but with shatter and with His voice! How I long to hear God's voice, even if it is in this destroying form. It is like music to my ears and God's every stroke is to the (beat of the) music. Music that has never been heard before and will only be heard again at the final destruction of the world. 

*33 Topheth has long been prepared;*
*it has been made ready for the king.*
*Its fire pit has been made deep and wide,*
*with an abundance of fire and wood;*
*the breath of the Lord,*
*like a stream of burning sulfur,*
*sets it ablaze.*

Topheth, or in other words, hell, has long been prepared, with an emphasis on *long*. God foreknew a long time ago who would end up there. Some call it determinism, but knowing something is going to happen, does not mean God forced this to happen. Of course God can alter things, and He does at times, but most of the time His plan happens and with our free will still taking place. So at best, only some events in history are determined, the rest is "random" yet according to God's plan and will and purpose (cf. Isaiah 14:24,27). 
One might argue that determinism means that everything is fixed already; My answer to that is *yes*, it is already fixed what you will choose today and tomorrow and what decisions you will make. But they will be *your* decisions out of *free choice*—in as far as we can perceive free choice.
