**The Mountain of the Lord**
*2:1-4pp — Mic 4:1-3*
*This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:*
*In the last days*
*the mountain of the Lord’s temple will be established*
*as the highest of the mountains;*
*it will be exalted above the hills,*
*and all nations will stream to it.*
*Many peoples will come and say,*
*“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,*
*to the temple of the God of Jacob.*
*He will teach us his ways,*
*so that we may walk in his paths.”*

It is hard to imagine that in the last days, whether we are in it already or whether it still has to come, that people will take the initiative to go find God. I assume they are not Christians. 
People right now are indeed increasingly looking for spirituality, as long as this god is not conflicting with matters of their wishes. Hence, they are looking for Shintoism, Buddhism and New Age like religions. If not a religion, they are taking up elements of other religions, in order to obtain the peace, such as yoga and pilates. 
I am surprised they will want to learn from God. Indeed, the church is growing in every part except for the West, but even in the West, some churches have major influence. 
The West is the leading culture. Every third World country will follow in the footsteps of the West as soon as they become a first world country. Unfortunately, they will adopt the culture and moral values as well, just like Singapore and Hong Kong have done, and just like this can be seen in Taiwan and Shanghai. 
If then West, however, can learn from God, then the second and third world countries still have a chance to follow God in the way  Isaiah describes here.

*The law will go out from Zion,*
*the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.*

I hope that many will come to realize that the law they have, has its origin in the Judeo-Christian law. I know that for a fact. God has spoken to leaders all over the world and wise men who made government. Everything in the law that is not from God, such as in Islamic countries and increasingly more in Western countries, is from the devil. 
Not only in the New Testament will the Word, that is Jesus, come out from Jerusalem, but in the last days, which is (almost) now, this will happen again. Perhaps it will be a Jew becoming president of a country or of something like the Nato, bringing peace and judgment through the or through a law, but perhaps it will come from Israel itself. Just like in the movie #tags/movies *World War Z*, starring Brad Pitt #tags/famouspeople, Israel was safe from other threats, and right now it is as good as the only country without debts and it relatively has the largest population of academics.
When everything fails, the economy and the digital world, because of some bomb or revolution, for example, perhaps then only Israel will stay standing and get to dictate the law to the world. 
May that day, if it comes, be blessed by God, so that it will be God speaking His Law, and not a human being.

*He will judge between the nations*
*and will settle disputes for many peoples.*
*They will beat their swords into plowshares*
*and their spears into pruning hooks.*
*Nation will not take up sword against nation,*
*nor will they train for war anymore.*
*Come, descendants of Jacob,*
*let us walk in the light of the Lord.*

How I long for the day that there will be no more wars and weapons. No armies to either defend themselves or attack others. 
That day there will be truly peace. Though that is not the definition of peace in the Bible, for God desires peace in one's heart, it cannot be that a country is willing to give up on all of its arms. There must be some faith in a higher power who will protect them. Today, this could be Nato or the United States, though they have not succeeded, but in the future it will be God alone.

***The Day of the Lord***
*6 You, Lord, have abandoned your people,*
*the descendants of Jacob.*
*They are full of superstitions from the East;*
*they practice divination like the Philistines*
*and embrace pagan customs.*

I need to remind myself that this is about Israel, not the United States or the West, because the situation is so similar. You are abandoning us in Europe right now. Even the Reformed Church in the Netherlands is calling Europe the "Empty Church", because people are fleeing away from church attendance. 
Instead, as mentioned above, people are tending to go for *eastern* religions such as New Age. 
People are not even looking for You anymore, why would You stay here? 

*7 Their land is full of silver and gold;*
*there is no end to their treasures.*
*Their land is full of horses;*
*there is no end to their chariots.*

This is coming to an end. The West, including Israel and Japan still has most of the money in the world, but it is slowly depleting. This is due to a the bad economy, which is as a cause of bad money management, because morals about saving and spending are vanishing. 
If one does not take care of the goods that God has lend us to manage over, as a steward, then He is going to take that away. 
China is coming up financially, but still has a long way to go to get to same level per capita and overcome corruption and the ideals of the American Constitution, such as free speech and the right to ... [gather, as in the Third Amendment].

*8 Their land is full of idols;*
*they bow down to the work of their hands,*
*to what their fingers have made.*
*9 So people will be brought low*
*and everyone humbled —*
*do not forgive them.*

The Jews were proud of what they had made. I do not know whether they were proud of the manual work of their idols and statues—although I can imagine, since it is very difficult to create these with rudimentary tools, as far as they were available back then—but they were proud of the fruit of their land and the money they made from foreigners. 
They forgot, however, that nothing they had could be established without  God. Their crops were a result of the Jordan and the rain. Nothing they had made. The resulting money was from the proceedings of their crops. 
Their customers were businessmen and travels going from the East to the West and South to the North and vice versa. But why would travelers cross their land? Because it was right in the intersection of the two main highways of that time. And why was it right in that intersection? Because God gave the Jews that land.
They forgot to praise and worship God for all these things, for *everything*, and did not realize it was *His* work that made all this possible. 

America has made some of the most innovative products, the Apple and Google products, to name a few. They are almost literally worshipping these two companies and the products they produce, wearing Apple product as ornaments around their wrist and showing them in their hands. They are Apple or Google fan without realizing these companies do not even care about them. Just like an idol would not respond to the prayers of a worshipper—and it is not able to because he does not have any powers—so these "powerful" companies do not respond. 
Americans do not realize it is God Who gave them *everything*. The only reason these corporates could rise, is because America has the perfect soil for these companies products. It has the knowledge (smart people), the money (from investors) and the customers (people with computers with Internet), and the right environment (in the case of Facebook, private, upper echelon universities). And all of this was only possible through capitalism and the Constitution, which is based on the Bible. 

*10 Go into the rocks, hide in the ground*
*from the fearful presence of the Lord*
*and the splendor of his majesty!*
*11 The eyes of the arrogant will be humbled*
*and human pride brought low;*
*the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.*

Isaiah is telling us to hide from the present of the Lord. Normally we would go *to* Him, but when God is showing His fearful presence and the splendor—note that He needs not even show His *full* splendor—people will hide in the ground. 
I am pretty sure that this is meant literally and a prophecy as well. I imagine that the simplest scenario would be that the sun is going to get extremely hot, or our atmosphere will not protect us due to a hole, and people in those places exposed by the extreme heat will hide in the ground. Unfortunately they still do not realize then that it is God's splendor He is showing there. They think it is merely a matter of particles (the atmosphere) and energy (heat) that is destroying the Earth. 
Even more unfortunate is that they do not realize that this too easy for God to do. The sun is only one out of trillions of stars He has made, most of which—perhaps—are many times larger than the sun. 
If they were to realize this, they would become humbled. Human pride, emphasizing the *human* part, would be brought low. For they would realize the limits of their own power and the unlimited resources of God. 

*12 The Lord Almighty has a day in store*
*for all the proud and lofty,*
*for all that is exalted*
*(and they will be humbled),*
*13 for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lofty,*
*and all the oaks of Bashan,*
*14 for all the towering mountains*
*and all the high hills,*
*15 for every lofty tower*
*and every fortified wall,*
*16 for every trading ship*
*and every stately vessel.*
*17 The arrogance of man will be brought low*
*and human pride humbled;*
*the Lord alone will be exalted in that day,*
*18 and the idols will totally disappear.*

That day will surely come, so *yes*, it is a prophecy. Humans are proud of what they have discovered, and discover it is. Discovering means uncovering something that has been covered. But that which was under the cover was created by someone else. 
Now humans have discovered fire and with it came buildings and vehicles. The many towers of Dubai indicate the pride of what man can achieve, just like the fast vehicles do and are a symbol of status and power. One who has a fast car wants to show others he has succeeded in life.

*19 People will flee to caves in the rocks*
*and to holes in the ground*
*from the fearful presence of the Lord*
*and the splendor of his majesty,*
*when he rises to shake the earth.*
*20 In that day people will throw away*
*to the moles and bats*
*their idols of silver and idols of gold,*
*which they made to worship.*

In the end people care more about their own lives than the idols they worship. On the one hand that seems good, because that would mean that in the end, when it comes to it, they will choose life over matter. Meaning that they will choose what's best for them, and materialism is not what is best for one's life. 
However, one can also interpret this in another way, which is that in the end, people will choose for themselves and abandon their gods, one of which is God Himself, seeing Him as only of the gods. 
But fortunately, that is not what is intended here. That is because God will show Himself and people will see the difference between an *actual* god and an idol. The will wat *splendor* and *glory* really mean and be frightened. Not because He is glorious, but because we are so sinful. 
A person from the country would not be ashamed of one's clothes and life, like Tom Sawyer was—without shoes every day but Sunday—but when someone from the city comes, he will suddenly realize his dirty clothes when he sees what *clean* really be. He will see quality and style and be ashamed of his own clothes. 
Some will feel ashamed while others will be drawn to it and wanting to wear that themselves as well. 

That is how God's glory works. It will shame us  for the lack of glory and sinlessness we have, but at the same time He invites us to become like Him, to strive for perfection, to have our sins forgiven in order to be sinlessness, pure and holy. See also Romans 12:1 for what true worship is. 

*21 They will flee to caverns in the rocks*
*and to the overhanging crags*
*from the fearful presence of the Lord*
*and the splendor of his majesty,*
*when he rises to shake the earth.*

When God shows His glory through His presence, people will become foolish, or at least act as such. We already see what fear does with people during an apocalypse, such as in *The Walking Dead*. People do all kinds of stuff just to stay alive, even if that only extends their life by a couple of minutes. Here too, we read that people will go to overhanging crags caverns in rocks—as if the things will protect you from a normal or radioactive bomb, let alone from God's presence which is at least a million times worse. 
The good thing is, at least then they will realize. Perhaps they will not be able to live through it, but at least they will come to realize in the moments before they die, Who their Creator was, the Father Who loved them and gave His life for them (cf. 2 Corinthians 5:15).

*22 Stop trusting in mere humans,*
*who have but a breath in their nostrils.*
*Why hold them in esteem?*

Humans cannot do anything. Compared to animals we would hardly survive if it were not for our intelligence and we have God to thank for that. 
But even if intelligence was ours, we still could not survive, because there would be selfishness. In our struggle for survival would, for example, kill others only to find out later that we need these others to survive.
The Spartans were such people, who killed the old and the young who were too weak to survive themselves. Their people were ruthless and relentless. I do not know if that has been their ultimate demise, but I can imagine that if the people were growing, they would have a bigger army to defend themselves. If they had let the old live, there would have been more wisdom of past failures to prevent new ones from happening. If they let the young ones live, those who were weak might have been the intellectual types, creating new inventions to improve warfare and life as well. 

Without  moral values, which is from God, and intelligence, which is from God as well, humans are worth nothing. Bare-skinned they would die in conditions too hot and cold. Without fangs and nails, or poison or strength, they would not have been able to defend themselves. 
Why hold them in esteem? We urge to, because we have become sinful and are inherently inclined sin and to worship idols. Another reason is that these idols bear attributes of God. They (seem to) have power, beauty and intelligence. All actors, businessmen and "cool" scientists seem to have these things, thus becoming the object of idolatry, without the humility to tell others they should not, but instead letting magazines post pictures of them to caress their ego even more.
