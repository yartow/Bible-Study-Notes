# Isaiah 37 (ESV) 
**Hezekiah Seeks Isaiah's Help**
*1 As soon as King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the Lord. 2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz. 3 They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth. 4 It may be that the Lord your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words that the Lord your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’”*

It was wise of Hezekiah to send for Isaiah for help. The wisest thing in any situation is to ask God for help and if you do not know how to, you should ask someone who does. 
**Hezekiah addresses his pain and his weakness. He expresses his hope in God's action and his faith in God that He is able.** These four things are important to share with God. 
Even when discussing your problem with a doctor you would say what you are feeling right now (pain) and where your weakness is, namely that you cannot do anything about it. Your hope would be to be healed, although you would not necessarily have faith in that doctor's abilities. If we share these things with a secular doctor who is a mortal as well, why then do we keep our prayer short and limited and should we not share these things with our God as well?

Dear God, 

You know my pain and my weakness. I am in hurt when people attack me for no reason. I am in anguish when my wife nags, and I do not know what to do about it—she does not clearly expresses her wish nor has she done beforehand. I can do what she wants but it does not mean that the next time I will have done everything according to her wishes? How can I make her realize that she should express her frustrations in a healthy way and that she is testing my patience here? I can only take so much and much of that is with Your help. Without You, oh Lord, I would not know what to do to make this marriage work. 
Please grant me Your strength and patience, Your endurance and perseverance. Like You had hope in Your Father's wishes and purpose for You here on Earth, grant me these as well so that I will know how to long others. Show me Your love, that I may show others Your greatness and forgiveness and the joy and peace that flows from it. 

Dear Lord, 

Thank You for Your patience with me. One way or the other I feel a peace and comfort over me and suddenly I have more love for my wife. This morning even, frustration came up in her when I said I could not hear her. Perhaps this is either because I my hearing is bad (according to her) or because the thing she said was not hard to understand, and she was frustrated that I *seemingly* did not understand the meaning of the acronym *BSO*—frustrated because as a father I should know more about my child's education and the acronyms used therein. 
Either way, I got frustrated because she did first, and once again I had to hold my temper, like I have been doing for the past few days, which have been especially hard because I was home all day with her. But as I prayed, God spoke to me and said:
> Treat her like the weaker vessel...  
As strange as it may be, for I had memorized this in the NIV version but the ESV one popped up, and though not directly but after a drive home and a break, it has really given me rest. 

*5 When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah, 6 Isaiah said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Thus says the Lord: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the young men of the king of Assyria have reviled me. 7 Behold, I will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land, and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.’”*

The Lord is able to put a spirit in man, either the Holy Spirit or an evil one, which will make him hear things that are not true. #todo/opzoeken  te rijmen met
Now this is hard to rhyme with the fact that God does not lie and does not do bad things. So if He did not lie then the king must have imagined it, for example by a hallucination or by becoming paranoid or crazy and it would have been the spirit that caused him to get crazy. However, would that not fall under the category of bad things? Note that this is most likely not an actual rumor, which God could have used as well, but it is a spirit through which Sennacherib hears this rumor. 
I do not know the answer, but I will not doubt my God. He is good and what He does, is good. *Everything* He does, is good.
But what matters here, is that people may actually think they are receiving things from God and in a sense they have, but what they have received is not true.

*8 The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish. 9 Now the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, “He has set out to fight against you.” And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 10 “Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. 11 Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, devoting them to destruction. And shall you be delivered? 12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my fathers destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar? 13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?’”*

Based on what Sennacherib had heard, though being a rumor, he acted. Now this can be attributed to Sennacherib alone and not to the message nor the messenger. Sennacherib was supposed to verify if a message was true before acting on it. Especially in war, one must not make hasty decisions. 
But aside from the decision of whether to invade Cush or not, or to invade Judah and Jerusalem before or after that, Sennacherib made his own decision to mock God again. Not only does he mock Him, he tells the Israelites "not to be deceived" by God—effectively calling God a deceiver, a liar! That alone is enough reason for God to kill him on the spot, and God not only does kill him—though not on the spot—but his men as well, 185 thousand of them in fact. 
So God's ways are unsearchable. Who would have thought that God would inspire Sennacherib to provoke Himself through a rumor?

**Hezekiah's Prayer for Deliverance**
*14 Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord. 15 And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord: 16 “O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, you are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth. 17 Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear; open your eyes, O Lord, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God. 18 Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands, 19 ::and have cast their gods into the fire.:: For they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed. 20 So now, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the Lord.”*

It finally dawns on me what "they" refers to in
> Therefore they were destroyed.  
The other statues of gods were no gods but the work of men's hands, that is why the statues were destroyed. All this time I thought Hezekiah was referring to the Assyrians and that they would be destroyed. 
It is of no coincidence then that the only god, or its statue thereof, the Assyrians had not been able to destroy was that of the One God, because there was no statue! Not that this is a way to save oneself, but to verhogen #todo/opzoeken  oneself to a higher position and show others: "I cannot be destroyed by something as small as fire. It is I Who *created* fire!"
God cannot be envisioned by a statue, it would be pure mockery. Any picture trying to depict the greatness of God, be it a cloud or an eye, would diminish God to that depiction and God is far greater than anything we can imagine. 
Hezekiah indeed knows what it means to follow God and therefore has out of the fear and reverence for Him, removed all the statues and altars on the high places. 
He knows that in times of trouble it is God he should run to. 
He might not have been as courageous as David but he was smart enough to run away from it. 

**Sennacherib's Fall**
*21 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria, 22 this is the word that the Lord has spoken concerning him:*
*“‘She despises you, she scorns you—*
*the virgin daughter of Zion;*
*she wags her head behind you—*
*the daughter of Jerusalem.*

Assyria probably did not know that Jerusalem despises Assyria. Though it must have had mighty rivers and well-flooded fields as a result of that, with technology surpassing that of Israel if the stories of ever flowing waters in the gardens of Babylon are true—which will come into existence not many years from the moment of Isaiah's words—which contain mechanisms to pump up the water, perhaps even driven by water, still Jerusalem scorns Assyria because it does not have the same loving God. 
Assyria's society will never be like that of Israel, with laws of peace and a righteousness that surpasses that of all nations—not only of that time, but even in this time. It is clean and hygienic, due to its ceremonial laws and free of STDs; people feel free and safe because of the Law, while in Assyria you can worship every god you want, but you cannot refuse to worship some gods at some times, as happened twice during Babylonian exile and during the Persian occupation with Daniel and his friends, and later on once more with Mordecai in the latter empire. Even Naaman the Syrian was obliged to kneel down before his king's god, as he mentioned before Elisha during the reign of Ahab's son Jehoram. 
So there was no religious freedom and no freedom of speech. There was sexual freedom, but this is a bad thing; and a surplus of land and water. Though the latter seems like a good thing, we know that God alone is able to give fruit. Water will dry up and the harvest may not come if nothing grows or dies due to pests and diseases. God is the only reliable source. 
Perhaps the Israelites knew all this; most certainly not all of them, but that does not matter. Isaiah speaks for all of the Israelites.

*23 “‘Whom have you mocked and reviled?*
*Against whom have you raised your voice*
*and lifted your eyes to the heights?*
*Against the Holy One of Israel!*
*24 By your servants you have mocked the Lord,*

Sennacherib does not realize he mocked the highest King of kings. He knew he mocked the holy one of Israel, thinking it was only one of the many fake gods, while thinking his own one was real, presumably. But I also presume he did not know that our God is Only One Who is real, and he did not realize His unimaginable Holiness. 
Nevertheless, he can be forgiven for what he did not know, but there must have been a lot of things he did know—such as pride, the knowledge of which is instilled in man as a bad thing—otherwise God would not have punished him. Even if I am wrong, one thing I may assume, is that God is always righteous, as every thing He does.

*and you have said, With my many chariots*
*I have gone up the heights of the mountains,*
*to the far recesses of Lebanon,*
*to cut down its tallest cedars,*
*its choicest cypresses,*
*to come to its remotest height,*
*its most fruitful forest.*
*25 I dug wells*
*and drank waters,*
*to dry up with the sole of my foot*
*all the streams of Egypt.*

Who does the king of Assyria think he is that he can climb the highest mountains and cut the tallest cedars. These trees are so large that perhaps ten people need to stretch hand to hand to form a circle around the tree. They have existed most probably before his grandfather was born. The height of it is *amazing*—a better word than that cannot describe these trees. Yet the arrogance of the king tells us that that he thinks he can cut down the tallest trees, climb the highest mountains with the greatest ease. He has not even been to the Himalayas and ascended these. Those mountains would humble him for sure.
Little does he know how great a power is rising and he will never know, for he will die before that happens. Both the new power of Babylon and the might of the Himalayas are created by God, simply by speaking a word of creation. How mighty then is our Lord? 
No one should ever defy Him but the king has done this all too clearly. 

*26 “‘::Have you not heard*::
::*that I determined it long ago?::*
*I planned from days of old*
*what now I bring to pass,*
*that you should make fortified cities*
*crash into heaps of ruins,*
*27 while their inhabitants, shorn of strength,*
*are dismayed and confounded,*
*and have become like plants of the field*
*and like tender grass,*
*like grass on the housetops,*
*blighted before it is grown.*
*28 “‘I know your sitting down*
*and your going out and coming in,*
*and your raging against me.*
*29 Because you have raged against me*
*and your complacency has come to my ears,*
*I will put my hook in your nose*
*and my bit in your mouth,*
*and I will turn you back on the way*
*by which you came.’*

The king's sin was not only against Jerusalem or Israel, it was against God. He did not only invade a house and the people living in it, he trespassed the privacy of the owner. That is the rage verse 29 is talking about. The complacency is the attitude with which the king does all this. It is like killing people without regrets or feelings. Those things God cannot stand—how His people, Israelites or not, are killed mercilessly and how His land is invaded and taken away by those who think they can take everything by force. 
Assyria needs to learn that it cannot take what belongs to the highest God. It should have known, #todo/opzoeken  wanneer gebeurd? 
for Naaman must have had to explain to his king (according to the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia this was Ben-hadad II) why he went to Israel and after that how he got healed. Yet even after this miraculous healing of Naaman's leprosy which no healer in the whole land of Assyria was able heal, it does not ring a bell that God is the real god? Naaman himself though, understood.

#biblestudy/questions When was Syria conquered by Assyria? Or when did Assyria rise? 
When did Aram win from Israel, in which war did the Aramites take the little Jewish girl for Naaman? 
Was the war in 1 Kings 22 against the Aramites? After this, there were three years of peace. 
Was Aram the same as Syria? Why the difference in translations? 
Wat betekent vers 30?

*30 ::“And this shall be the sign for you: this year you shall eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs from that.:: Then in the third year sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. 31 And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward. 32 For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.*

It requires patience before we see the works of the Lord, but we may know that He has it all planned out. Not only does he know when it his plan will be unveiled and come into action, but it will happen exactly as He predicts. No, it is not a prediction because He is not guessing or analyzing what will happen, it is the other way around: it will happen *because* He says it. 
Now these two years of waiting have a purpose. First of all to show us that it exactly happens at the time of God. In other words, the fact that this prophecy comes true gives glory to God.  
The second reason is to train us in patience. We need to learn how to endure in times of need and to pray to God for help. However, at the same time God is merciful and helps in those needs, amongst other by letting us know that His salvation is coming. We can endure much more when we know what will happen, when a promise of hope is given. This is how He helps us. He "cannot" end this period of drought and hunger sooner because of the next reason, but he can make it more bearable.
This is speculation, but I think the third reason is that God is preparing things in this time of waiting. Things are happening all over the world—in Assyria Sennacherib's sons was building up his plans to murder their father, which would happen soon, and Esarhaddon, who take over the throne, would make a mess out of ruling the empire, not having control over the previously submitted #todo/opzoeken  onderworpen Babylonians which caused them now to rebel and take over the Assyrian empire together with the Medes and replace it with the Neo-Babylonian one. All of this took time to prepare and God, however subtle, controlled the whole process even though all of events happened as a cause of the free will of man. 

*33 “Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow there or come before it with a shield or cast up a siege mound against it. 34 By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come into this city, declares the Lord. 35 For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David.”*

God is a very precise God. As mentioned above, *everything* happened out of free will. Even if it did not, even if He forced or controlled some people to change the future, He would be allowed to due to His sovereignty, but He does not do that. His free will is 100.00 percent, no less than that. 
God is also precise in His words. If He says that no arrow will be shot, then not a single arrow will be shot. If there was an arrow shot, then it is we who misinterpreted the Bible.

In verse 35 God says He defends this city for His own sake and for the sake of David. It is the city He loves and which He created for His people. Is this city different from other cities? If God had blessed other cities and let Abraham's offspring start their nation there, would that city then not be the holiest city in the world? Of course, those cities would have less crossroads and fruitful, but what was so special about Israel and what is special about it now, when all the advantages can be replaced by technology? That is, a shortage of water could be solved by desalination of seawater; being on the crossroads of world trades can be achieved through being attractive for airline carriers or ships to land there. Dubai does the first (desalination) and second (airline) while Panama (channel from the Pacific to the Atlantic) and Saudi-Arabia (Suez channel) do the latter, and Cape Town as well (in the past and perhaps still in the present). 
In the past, in the times of the patriarchs these advantages were not present so Israel was the perfect choice. After so many of the great men of history died there, the patriarchs were buried together with their wives and everywhere are remnants of Jacob (his well, for example) and other prophets (take for example the valley of Achor) this place would still be best place for the Israelites to grow in their relation with God. 
This argument is from my limited human point of view. I am sure there must be a greater and better argument. I forgot to mention the argument that Israel is on the center of the three continents right in the middle of the Middle East, in the middle of their biggest enemies and it is exactly those people to whom they need to spread the good news of God and ultimately of their Savior Jesus Christ. That is not only a matter of the past, but of the present as well. 
How about Australia, India, the countries in the Far East? These are all part of God's plan and are reached out to by Christians as the Israelites have never been on an evangelization track. 

*36 And the angel of the Lord went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. And when people arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies. 37 Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home and lived at Nineveh. 38 And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, struck him down with the sword. And after they escaped into the land of Ararat, Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.*

I do not know if the number 185,000 has any symbolic meaning to it, but I do know it is a great number, even for our present day army sizes. The Assyrian army was a considerable size and built-up out of armies from multiple nations, but it was the largest in the world at that time. Even now, North-Korea's 1 million soldiers are perhaps mostly soldiers drafted for war, and not full-time members of the army. But that is my guess. 
In any case, I do not know the number of people Sennacherib brought to Jerusalem, but apparently it was not much greater than this number. God killed enough of those men to scare him off. If Sennacherib had brought a million soldiers, God probably would have killed half of those, 500,000, to scare him off, or Sennacherib would still have three quarters left and think he were able to fight Jerusalem. 
Did all of those 185,000 die in one night? I am not sure of that. Josephus says it was the plague, so that would usually mean they slowly died. God *could have* used that to kill them off, even in one night, but it seems to me it happened as it is written, namely by the angel of the Lord and indeed, in one single night, because it says that people discovered this only in the morning.
