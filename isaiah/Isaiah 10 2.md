# Isaiah 10 
But when we ignore these warnings, to me at least — God does not seem the type to give a slightly bigger warning and then steadily increasing until we understand. 
No, when we have pushed the limits, God comes with His full force and causes death, figuratively or sometimes literally.
When God decides to act it *will* have effect. One will either die to himself and allow God to reign in his life, as in David's case, or he will let his heart die and ignore whatever God is telling him, as in the case of Solomon. 
Nebuchadnezzar changed — after a graceful period of seven years — and lived, whereas Belshazzar did not and died.  

God seems harsh in doing this, but it actually is out of love.

What is better, letting us suffer for a longer time or just to pull the band-aid?
