# Isaiah 48 (ESV) 
**Israel Refined for God's Glory**
*1 Hear this, O house of Jacob,*
*who are called by the name of Israel,*
*and who came from the waters of Judah,*
*who swear by the name of the Lord*
*and confess the God of Israel,*
*but not in truth or right.*
*2 For they call themselves after the holy city,*
*and stay themselves on the God of Israel;*
*the Lord of hosts is his name.*

Israel swears by her own God, but they do so to be one group, to be different from other groups, but only in words, for they worshipped other gods as well. They *say* they Israelites and followers of the One God. They swear by His Name and confess the God of Israel, but do they actually act like they His children? No. They are sinning against God and not withholding His Law. 
It is like many Muslims today who do the same things for one reason only—not for the prize that awaits them, but to belong to a group. They want to be identified as Muslims, just so they know who they are. 
God want us to be His followers, but 

*3 “The former things I declared of old;*
*they went out from my mouth, and I announced them;*
*then suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.*
*4 Because I know that you are obstinate,*
*and your neck is an iron sinew*
*and your forehead brass,*
*5 I declared them to you from of old,*
*before they came to pass I announced them to you,*
*lest you should say, My idol did them,*
*my carved image and my metal image commanded them.’*
*6 “You have heard; now see all this;*
*and will you not declare it?*

God prophesies in different ways. This happens to be the definition of a prophet as well. God can predict the future and He can explain something people have already seen, but did not understand the meaning of. For this obstinate people of Israel it was necessary to use the former way. 
As with so many atheists or former religious people, if they want to dismiss God's intervention they will dismiss it using coincidence—or in this case by saying another god did them. 

*From this time forth I announce to you new things,*
*hidden things that you have not known.*
*7 They are created now, not long ago;*
*before today you have never heard of them,*
*lest you should say, ‘Behold, I knew them.’*

Now God is using another method and I am not quite clear whether this method is the same as the latter method I mentioned. It does say "things that you have not known", so that contradicts my statement. Perhaps there is a third way of prophesying. 
Is this third way, like MacArthur claims, the prediction that everything is in line with each other and culminating towards one goal? Is it the explanation of foreshadowing events like Babylon and Cyrus to the greater events like the Babylon of Revelations and Jesus Christ? If this is true, then this would not really be "new" because Abraham already knew that the ram that replaced the sacrifice of his son was a foreshadow of Jesus and David knew as well that a Messiah would come and the God existed of at least two Persons when He said "the Lord said to my Lord." 
The answer is, it is new because there now is an explanation of the deeper meaning, the so-called mystery Paul mentioned in his letters that Jews did not even understand in his days. 
Whereas the first type of prophecy speaks of the future and the second type speaks of the past and only explains (1) what is going to happen and (2) why this particular event is happening, it does not explain why something else is happening. In contrast, the third type of prophecy, is about *both* past and future events and speaks of events further away in the future, by analogy those mountains behind the ones we can see.
Prophecy Type 2, for example, is speaking of the coming of Cyrus, but not that Cyrus will like Jesus Christ in saving the world, executing his righteousness throughout the world, releasing the prisoners and letting the children of God go home. 
A prophecy of Type 1 would explain why the people of Israel were punished by David arrogance to count his people or why Simson married a Philistine (in order to exact his revenge on the Philistines through her), but it would not explain anything beyond the scope of that event. 
A prophecy of Type 3 would, for example (a made up explanation), explain how God let His people marry the devil, as the Israelites have done by worshipping idols, so that God has a reason to punish the devil. 
Prophecies of Type 3 are used, as far as I know, exclusively for the first and second coming of Jesus Christ.

*8 You have never heard, you have never known,*
*from of old your ear has not been opened.*
*For I knew that you would surely deal treacherously,*
*and that from before birth you were called a rebel.*

Is God calling the Israelites here treacherous dealers? Even now Jews are known among the world as treacherous dealers. Some say that this is the reason they are rich—Hitler even used this argument (if I have learned this in school correctly) to stir up the Germans against the Jews. And aside from their trade, the Jewish are known to be stubborn as well, perhaps being the toughest people to evangelize to. 

*9 “For my name's sake I defer my anger;*
*for the sake of my praise I restrain it for you,*
*that I may not cut you off.*
*10 Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver;*
*I have tried you in the ::furnace of affliction::.*
*11 For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it,*
*for how should my name be profaned?*
*My glory I will not give to another.*

God has to purify his people so that they will not be cut off. Not in the way through the Holy Spirit as He is doing with Christians, but through affliction. 
God's, however holy, is used as profanity, but God must keep His Name holy. He must therefore cast out those who are not honoring God. 

**The Lord's Call to Israel**
*12 “Listen to me, O Jacob,*
*and Israel, whom I called!*
*I am he; I am the first,*
*and I am the last.*
*13 My hand laid the foundation of the earth,*
*and my right hand spread out the heavens;*
*when I call to them,*
*they stand forth together.*

The heavens which are so grand, even larger, wider, higher and deeper, probably not heavier though, but in everything grander than the oceans—they obey God in a wink when He calls out to them. Like soldiers standing in a row, commanded by the sergeant. 
And we, puny humans, who cannot even contain the deepness of the oceans and have probably never been at the deepest parts, who cannot imagine the amount of water and intricately complexity of animals living there under extreme circumstance—we dare to disobey our God. 
How deep is God's love for us? And how deep His mercy to forgive us for this attitude?  
It is not how He made us, but it is the natural and logical consequence of what happens when all of the good, which only comes from God's Spirit, has left man.  
It is like a man who has created heat and places that in his creation. When he takes out this heat source out of his creation only cold remains in the creation. 

So badness is in us and it is not because God placed it there, it is because God pulled away His Spirit from us when we, or in that case Adam, started sinning.
But still, badness is completely contrary to God's character and goodness is not something that God *has*, but it is what He *is*. Everything that is only a little bit good anywhere in the universe is because it has ever been in touch with God. 

*14 “Assemble, all of you, and listen!*
*Who among them has declared these things?*
*The Lord loves him;*

Who is this "him"? #biblestudy/questions

*he shall perform his purpose on Babylon,*
*and his arm shall be against the Chaldeans.*
*15 I, even I, have spoken and called him;*
*I have brought him, and he will prosper in his way.*

Even if this "him" is referring to the Chaldeans, it would not even be a contradiction to say that God loves him, though His arm is against them, for God loves everyone even when He punishes them. Better yet, it is exactly because of His love that He punishes people.
God is not like human beings who can do bad things to other people, just because they feel like it, or who want to reach a goal and have to get rid of those standing in the way. No, God only hurts people—or better said, He lets people be hurt by their own wrongdoings or by the devil—because He loves them and wants to protect them from sinning even more. Also, He is protecting others by punishing one, as in the current context of the Chaldeans, which are most likely the Assyrians, who have struck the whole Middle-East and even Europe and Africa and would have continued if not for the Babylonians. 
Now God loves the Babylonians as well, even though He already knew that Nebuchadnezzar would become proud and his son #todo/opzoeken would disrespect God in the same way as his father had done. 
But still, God speaks to Babylon, He gives them a chance, He lets them prosper, just like He has given those things to the kings of Judah, many of whom did not regard God as their Higher Power and King of Israel. Babylon had a chance to become converts to Judaism, to be saved and be called believers. 
I believe God wanted Babylon to act justly, yet being merciful, towards the Jews—to punish those who needed to be punished and then after a certain period, let them return to Israel. 
Can Babylon be blamed? They were just as bad as the Jews. The Jews had the prerogative of having a forefather like Abraham and David through whom God has promised to always be their God. In a sense one could say they had more chances than Babylon has got. 
Even if the Jews were better, it could be said that they were only better because they have had more contact with God than other nations, and through contact with Him His goodness has changed them more than others. But neutrally seen, the Jews were just as bad as the Babylonians. So the question arises or remains, depending from which standpoint you were: Is God fair in letting the empire and the people of Babylon perish?
The answer is, by definition, *yes*. The definition of concepts as *fair* and *just* are defined by Who God is, and His sovereignty allows Him to go past these definitions as our conceptions of *fair* and *just* are limited to what our brain allows. But in addition to that, **I believe that God gives everyone enough sanity to make their own decisions.** Even Nebuchadnezzar who was a beast for seven years—and I must say that I do not know whether the seven years were a punishment or whether it took Him seven years to realize that God was the One Who gave him this empire—could still make the right choice in his beast-like state to give God all glory for what He has done. 
By that time, unfortunately, Nebuchadnezzar's son had already grown up with the haughtiness inherited from his father, the bad influence from the people around him and most likely the worship of idols on top of that. But it is the former, his haughtiness, pride and arrogance, that brought him down. 
So the people of Babylon, as well as the Chaldeans, had their chance to make their decision, but they chose against God instead of *for* God.

*16 Draw near to me, hear this:*
*from the beginning I have not spoken in secret,*
*from the time it came to be I have been there.”*
*::And now the Lord God has sent me, and his Spirit.::*
*17 Thus says the Lord,*
*your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:*
*“I am the Lord your God,*
*who teaches you to profit,*
*who leads you in the way you should go.*

The promises following are led by paying attention to God's commandments. And those are in turn led by drawing near to God. For who would follow commandments if he did not first knew God? It is people for whom we do things, that is our greatest motivation in life. Like single mothers who work triple jobs for their children to survive, or men giving their lives to go abroad and serve their country. It is all for others based on relationships.  
God made us this way, this is what motivates us. Even the greatest dictators were married and had children or wives they loved. Perhaps there are exceptions, but in general this is true.  
But aside from this relation out of which our love and respect and obedience to God flows, it is the latter that will fulfill the promises.  
It is like giving someone a knife and then saying "are you willing to die for me? If so, prove it." We have been given this promise on the condition of this relationship. Do we really love God? That is why God says, "prove you love Me by showing obedience to my commandments."

::*18 Oh that you had paid attention to my commandments!*::
::*Then your peace would have been like a river,*::
::*and your righteousness like the waves of the sea;*:: #biblestudy/memorization/todo

Righteousness, once again, shows up here and shows how important to God this part of His character is. To Him every aspect of His character is important, but to us some are obviously less important and that is why God has to emphasize this.  
It almost just like that to God every sin is bad, but some sins are committed more frequently than others and so these are mentioned more often than the other sins, such as money and sexual immorality.  

God is not talking about a little bit of righteousness and peace. But peace like a river. If you have ever seen a real river in life and taken a bit more time than just a few minutes looking at it, you will realize how much water is in there. The water you have been looking at a minute ago has descended many meters away.  
If you realize how long it takes to fill a swimming pool and how many liters of water is in it, you will realize how much water is in this river. It is unending and so is the sea. If we were to put a dam on the river, it would overflow a whole city in minutes.  
As for waves, that is like a river but even more. It is wider and higher. But also, there is the aspect of strength and continuity. Passing on to the next generation.  
How strong are waves? Is there anything they cannot break, with enough time? Speaking otherwise, is there anything that can break waves? The answer is an obvious no. So righteousness should be. It should be so strong that nothing can break it.  

*like the waves of the sea; your offspring would have been like the sand, and your descendants like its grains; their name would never be cut off or destroyed from before me."*

This part seems to confirm what I wrote in yesterday's devotional. The description of the promises made to Babylon *if* they had obeyed God, are very like, or perhaps exactly like, those made to Abraham.
Now it is the opposite, almost no one knows of Babylon, we do not even know how to distinguish Babylonian DNA and these people have gone up in multiple tribes, peoples and nations.  
No one even knew the language and as far as what we know, it is still guess work based on a few scrolls or tablets which contained multiple languages, under the assumption that what was written in both languages were actually translations.  
Unlike Hebrew which has been preserved throughout the ages. The Israelite descendants are not like sand or its grains, but that is perhaps because they did not abide by the first covenant made with Abraham.

*20 Go out from Babylon, flee from Chaldea,*
*declare this with a shout of joy, proclaim it,*
*send it out to the end of the earth;*
*say, “The Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob!”*
*21 They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts;*
*he made water flow for them from the rock;*
*he split the rock and the water gushed out.*

The Israelites are a people so blessed by God that not even after walking for forty years in the desert their shoes were damaged. God did not have to do that. He could have let their feet be unharmed even if they had been walking barefooted. But that would not be, perhaps, as great a miracle as letting shoes stay unharmed.
Moreover, God did this because He cares about people. He showed it so clearly to the Israelites, every day again. Granted, the Israelites were thirsty and did not have bread, water or meat for a short while. However, God showed them miracles in the ten plagues of Egypt and how they, as the only people living there, were unharmed by the ten plagues, especially the last one. The could and should have known that their God was able to provide in these basic things. That was their first mistake. 
Their second mistake was that they did not ask. 
Their third mistake is that when they asked, or rather commanded or complained to Moses and to God as well, they were not respectful to God. 
Their fourth mistake is that they were not grateful for everything they already had received from God, which are freedom from the Egyptians and a land of their own. The Israelites did say something along the lines of "what good is it to be free, but to die out in the desert?", but I refer to their first mistake, so their argument is invalid. Also, in many stories people rather die as a free man than to live under bondage. The Israelites did not understand this concept and still do not. The Chinese, once again very likening the Israelites, do not understand this either. In this sense, but only in this sense, they could learn from the Greek or Romans such as Spartacus and the 300 Spartans.
Now, again, God gives the Jews—not Israelites anymore, for Israelites was used for the whole nation and all people in it, but after Israel had split into Israel and Judah the northern people were called Israelites while the southern were called Jews—a chance to flee Babylon

*22 “There is no peace,” says the Lord, “for the wicked.”*
#biblestudy/devotionals/isaiah

The wicked will have no peace until they become good within the span of their life. If they do not, they will not experience peace in the span after their life, which will be in hell. 
*Becoming good*, however, is not something they can choose to do or to be, the only choice they have is to choose for Jesus or not, or in the time of the Chaldeans and Babylonians, to reject their own gods and choose for the Holy One of Israel.
