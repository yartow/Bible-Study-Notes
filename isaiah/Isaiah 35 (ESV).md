# Isaiah 35 (ESV)
#biblestudy/devotionals/isaiah

**The Ransomed Shall Return**
*1 The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad;*
*the desert shall rejoice and blossom like the crocus;*
*2 it shall blossom abundantly*
*and rejoice with joy and singing.*
*The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it,*
*the majesty of Carmel and Sharon.*
*They shall see the glory of the Lord,*
*the majesty of our God.*

Is the wilderness referring to the land Israel, that land which was fruitful and consisted of milk and honey? Even if it is, now it will blossom once again, it will blossom abundantly. There will be sounds of the wind through the flowers and trees, and those of animals and insects, that most probably is the "rejoice" verse 2 speaks of. 
It will have trees as large as those of the Lebanon. I do not know what Carmel and Sharon have to offer #todo/opzoeken  but they too shall see the glory of the Lord, that is they shall see what God is capable of. 
God is capable of bringing back the ransomed Israelites, He can bring rain and grow trees, He can even move and create mountains. 

*3 Strengthen the weak hands,*
*and make firm the feeble knees.*
*4 Say to those who have an anxious heart,*
*“Be strong; fear not!*
*Behold, your God*
*will come with vengeance,*
*with the recompense of God.*
*He will come and save you.”*

But most of all, God can give hope, something none other than Him alone can give, for He is the definition of hope and the peace that flows out of it. No other thing exists that can give a man hope, but salvation from his troubles and no salvation exists than that which God can give.
If a man is in debt, his only hope is that his debts are solved. For sure, another good-hearted and rich man could solve the problems of this person, but then the former would be indebted to the other, either materialistically or in another form. Also, where would the former man get his hope from that someday a random person would show up to pay his debts out of good will? The odds of that happening are ever miniscule.
But with God one can know that everything is in His hands. Not only his debt, but also the creditor, that is the person who loaned the debt to him, and the person above him etc. God already has a plan that involves the debtor and his debt and God will use this debt for His glory. As a matter of fact He will use everything for His glory for God will never let anything happen that is *not* for His glory. 
This is hard to understand, but within the boundaries of righteousness and free will, God can still let everything that happens be for His glory. Simply said—although I realize that in simplifying this I might be condescending God's all-powerful and by humans incomprehensible work and plan—God makes sure every cause eventually has a positive effect. 
This man in our example has incurred debts due to bad financial behavior. But because of it he has learned lessons to prevent this from happening another time and now he is teaching others to use their money wisely. 

*5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened,*
*and the ears of the deaf unstopped;*
*6 then shall the lame man leap like a deer,*
*and the tongue of the mute sing for joy.*
*For waters break forth in the wilderness,*
*and streams in the desert;*

There are two things that happen simultaneously, two things worthy of joy. The sick will be healed, whether blind, deaf, lame or mute, and waters will break forth in the desert. Not only will the blind man, for example, be joyful because he can see again, but he will be joyful because he can see water in the desert! This is joy upon joy. God surprises us each time when He gives us immeasurable joy. A joy we could not have imagined and even if we have experienced it before, the next time He gives a joy even greater than the previous one. 
Also, His joy is incomprehendible, #todo/opzoeken  for it could come at times of mourning and yet we could feel overflowing joy. How is this possible? It is because it is joy that the world does not see and cannot explain. We try to explain it by the hope we have. Perhaps it is because we have hope in that the world will change, but what hope is their one's loved one has passed away? What does it matter then if the world will change or if the war will end? 
The only hope that matters then is when everything will turn back to how it was, concerning the good things then and only heaven can provide this hope. It is the place where loved ones can be seen again, in a world without pain and sorrow. It is also the place where some loved ones will not be because they did not believe in such a place, but there will be no sadness, even for those whom we miss here on Earth. 

*7 the burning sand shall become a pool,*
*and the thirsty ground springs of water;*
*in the haunt of jackals, where they lie down,*
*the grass shall become reeds and rushes.*

Opposite things will happen. The driest #todo/opzoeken  place on Earth, the desert, where in some places it rains only once every hundred years, will become a *pool* and there will be *springs* of water. Yes, we know that the desert becomes a pool after a heavy rain or flood, or if we put water in it. In certain places there are oases, but we have not seen that the whole desert will become a spring. 
The water under the surface of the Earth will some day come out. Perhaps not in this world, but on the New Earth. 

::*8 And a highway shall be there,*::
::*and it shall be called the Way of Holiness;*::
::*the unclean shall not pass over it.*::
::*It shall belong to those who walk on the way;*::
::*even if they are fools, they shall not go astray.*::
#biblestudy/memorization/todo

We have the assurance from God Himself, Who sproke through His prophet Isaiah that there will be a highway only for those who walk on the way and once people are on it, even if they are fools, they will not go astray. 
How is this #todo/opzoeken  te rijmen? Fools do not choose wisdom and do not choose to believe in Christ. However, if any fool chooses to give up his life and follow God then this fool will be on the Way of Holiness. It does not mean they can sin however they like, but it does mean that every sin will be learned from as a lesson. The sin will lead them *further* from God, but the lesson learned from it and the punishment or other form of consequence God uses will bring them *closer* to God.
Romans 8:28, for example, is only valid for those who believe, that is, for those on this Way of Holiness. 

*9 No lion shall be there,*
*nor shall any ravenous beast come up on it;*
*they shall not be found there,*
*but the redeemed shall walk there.*
*10 And the ransomed of the Lord shall return*
*and come to Zion with singing;*
*everlasting joy shall be upon their heads;*
*they shall obtain gladness and joy,*
*and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.*

No lions will be on the highway, our way to heaven is one way without traffic jams or accidents or #todo/opzoeken  afslagen, this destiny is certain. However, one must realize that this road is virtual and that in this material and physical world on Earth, we still have a harsher road to walk where physical lions, that is the animals, and spiritual ones, that is the devil, will be on the road either to devour us or block our road. On this earthly road there are traffic jams, blockades and accidents. But with every passing day we progress on the Way of Holiness.
