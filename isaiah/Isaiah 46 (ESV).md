# Isaiah 46 (ESV)
**The Idols of Babylon and the One True God**
*1 Bel bows down; Nebo stoops;*
*their idols are on beasts and livestock;*
*these things you carry are borne*
*as burdens on weary beasts.*

The idols of the fake gods Bel and Nebo only cause burdens. What is a god who cannot even walk himself and has to burden the animals? Even kings of that days—at least the Chinese ones—did not want to be carried or pulled by animals but only by men, but the idols are so worthless they can be carried by beasts. 

*2 They stoop; they bow down together;*
*they cannot save the burden,*
*but themselves go into captivity.*

Perhaps it is the method in which these idols, depicted as humans, are being transferred into exile: faced down, as if they are kowtowing or stooping and praying to the gods, which they are themselves. They could not save themselves either. 
However, in all honesty, this makes me think of how the Ark of God was transferred to Persia—by that time, instead of Babylon. This too was stolen and most probably shipped on a cart pulled by animals—it did not stoop or bow though, because it was not made in the form of a human. What do we say of that? 

*3 “Listen to me, O house of Jacob,*
*all the remnant of the house of Israel,*
*who have been borne by me from before your birth,*
*carried from the womb;*
*4 even to your old age I am he,*
*and to gray hairs I will carry you.*
*I have made, and I will bear;*
*I will carry and will save.*

Contrasting the idols of pagans, God is the One Who carries *us*, He is the One Who will save, he will not save the idols, but *us*. Not only does God carry us in life until we are of old age, but He carried us *into* life, from the moment we were in the womb. Such a loving Creator, Father and carrier we have, Who ultimately even carried our sins. 

*5 “To whom will you liken me and make me equal,*
*and compare me, that we may be alike?*

No one is like God. No, I did not write *no is God*, for that everyone already knows, but no one is even "like" God. It is almost impossible to say "like" and say the truth. Even if we say Buddha is like God, but for the Buddhists, that is totally untrue. Buddha, like the Greek and Hindu gods, are limited. Their limits may be higher than that of men, but they are limited. Compared to God's limitlessness, it is laughable to even dare to say that anyone is "like" God. God's array of characteristics is much better and vast than any other god mentioned in history or all gods combined. God is so great and intricate that none could even imagine and make up their own god like or surpassing God. God keeps surprising us. 
In order to have a god as awesome and fearful, and as loving and righteous, as God, there is only one way: he would have to punish all the people in the world for their sin. A truly righteous god would punish the people for all of their sin, either on Earth or after Earth. In Hinduism people are not even punished after Earth but after "heaven", whatever their temporary intermittence is called where they go to before reincarnating back on Earth in a new form. 
But if this god punishes people according to their sin, no one would go to heaven. So in Hinduism and Buddhism there would be less and less men—and cows for that matter, because these rank higher than men—because all of them would convert to lower forms of life, namely women, animals and insects. This is not what we see. 
Furthermore, in Buddhism there would never be a Buddha, not even the first one, Gaudama, or whatever his name is #todo/opzoeken . Even if he reached nirvana by giving up all of his longings, he still has in him the sin he committed, which cannot be washed away. 
In Islam there would be no speaking of heaven, no promise of that or of anyone ever being there, because no one would be, for the simple reason that their god is a righteous god, who must punish everyone and He may be able to forgive, but He cannot have a relationship with any human being unless there is an intercessor, i.e. someone who takes our sin on him. 
In short, no religion would ever exist, because there would be no heaven or any promise for a better life. 
The only religions that would exist is if there were gods who were less righteous and where the Law was less expansive and comprehensive, where certain sins would be seen as righteous. The Greek and Roman, and perhaps the Phoenician, Babylonian and older pagan religions meet such a definition. #todo/opzoeken  voldoen aan deze definitie. 
But in that case, we get back to our premise, that *no god* is like our God. That may be the reason why no one has ever made up a god like God, because it is utterly unattractive to follow a god like Him. One would get no followers. And should one think of a god like God, and decide to follow this kind of god because everything is logically correct, then he will come to the conclusion that this God does exist, this religion already exists, and that His Name is YHWH. #church/material

*6 Those who lavish gold from the purse,*
*and weigh out silver in the scales,*
*hire a goldsmith, and he makes it into a god;*
*then they fall down and worship!*
*7 They lift it to their shoulders, they carry it,*
*they set it in its place, and it stands there;*
*it cannot move from its place.*
*If one cries to it, it does not answer*
*or save him from his trouble.*

Everything about this god and its idol show inferiority to even mankind. It is dependent on man for everything. The idol needs to be *paid* for, from man's own pockets. It needs to be *created*. It cannot walk, it must be *carried*. Lastly, it is not written here, but elsewhere in Isaiah, it cannot even stand, it needs to be *fixed*. 
Now what does this idol return for all the work that has been done for it? It does not hear nor answer and it does not save man from his trouble. Much more can be said about these idols, and everything would be negative. For the thoughts man has imposed on these gods, the religious laws for sacrifice of cows, children, sex slaves through temple prostitution, are made up by man, inspired by the devil, and all of these lead to conditions worse than before. 
STDs are transmitted, children are murdered or brought into slavery. What good is it to society or the economy? I can literally not see a single benefit to this idolatry. 

*8 “Remember this and stand firm,*
*recall it to mind, you transgressors,*
*9 remember the former things of old;*
*for I am God, and there is no other;*
*I am God, and there is none like me,*
*10 declaring the end from the beginning*
*and from ancient times things not yet done,*
*saying, My counsel shall stand,*
*and I will accomplish all my purpose,’*
*11 calling a bird of prey from the east,*
*the man of my counsel from a far country.*
*I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass;*
*I have purposed, and I will do it.*

Unlike God, Who proves He is God time after time, from 6000 years ago up until now, everything has come true, except for the things that still have to happen. He has predicted what would happen. Well, you might say that some witches have done that as well. But what have they predicted? Have they predicted anything relevant? Have they predicted over a period as long as this? 
Not only predictions, but God even makes it happen. He called up Cyrus, his bird of prey from the east, to establish what He has predicted. God is right and speaks the truth when He predicts, because He has the fate of this world in His own hand. 

*12 “Listen to me, you stubborn of heart,*
*you who are far from righteousness:*
*13 I bring near my righteousness; it is not far off,*
*and my salvation will not delay;*
*I will put salvation in Zion,*
*for Israel my glory.”*

Those who are far from righteousness. God is speaking about those who do not take care of their fellowmen, those who participate in enacting child labor all over the world. Not only the people of that age, who participated in slavery, but of this age as well. Those who buy their clothes or gear at Primark, Zara sometimes H&M and a plethora of other brands. People know about this, but they are stubborn of heart. They are not willing to change. 
It is not that God says in verse 13 that because the people will not come to His righteousness, therefore He will bring it to them. No, what God is saying is, "because you were *not* righteous against those people, I will bring my punishment, which *is* righteous. And it will not take long before it arrives. It will not even be far off, it will be in Jerusalem." 
For one this will be punishment, for the other it will be salvation. Unfortunately it cannot be said that for all Jews this was salvation, for the Jews themselves were guilty of unrighteousness as well. Back in the days of Solomon (and even in Saul's time) the Jews had slaves for the hard labor. I doubt whether that could be interpreted as "servants". But before their captivity, as Micah speaks of, the Jews were unrighteous against their own fellow Jews where the price of housing increased so high that people were unable to buy houses, and the rich ones had two houses instead. 
So when the Jews got back in Israel after the first release by king Cyrus, and later on when they were released by king Darius, Nehemiah encountered some stubborn Jews. I am not sure whether these Jews were the ones released in the first or second return, or whether they had stayed in Israel and lived there ever since the captivity of the elitarian Jews. #biblestudy/questions But these Jews had a negative attitude against Nehemiah and those who wanted to rebuild the wall. This unrighteousness deserved its punishment as well. 

What happened in those days?
