# Isaiah 56
**Salvation for Foreigners**
*1 Thus says the Lord:*
*“Keep justice, and do righteousness,*
*for soon my salvation will come,*
*and my righteousness be revealed.*

As in many post-apocalyptic movies we see dystopian societies where many have gone to rampage, leaving all morals, simply to survive. The reason they do not fear this sinful behavior is because they think the world is coming to and end anyway. They do not want to kill themselves just yet, they actually *want* to survive and have a good life, but they think that survival is needed in the first place in order to have a good life. 
Quite often the protagonist is one who thinks otherwise and does what is right. This is what God is telling us as well. We have to keep doing the right thing. 
Jesus will come to the Earth, and He will judge and save people. 
In this case it took about 700 years before Jesus would come. Is that soon? It does not seem like a short time, but it was especially in those 300 years before the Babylonian captivity that the world seemed very post-apocalyptic. The economy was at its lowest point, the country was run down by the Assyrians if not before that by more local enemy nations. 
It would take a great deal of righteousness and motivation to keep on doing the right thing, to keep justice that is. If Isaiah had not warned them at this time, and had warned them, say, 20 years before Jesus would be born, there perhaps would not be any Jews left.
You see, in the Netherlands, as in the rest of the world, we have a striking example of the decline of Christianity—and I would not be surprised to see and even assume the same pattern in Judaism—even though this is not due to a strong will to survive whereby people are giving up Christian values. My point is, even without external factors people tend to give up on God and in western countries more people are leaving the church than there are joining one. In a society with a struggle to survival it would be even harder to maintain Christian values. Look at the times of William Booth, England in the 1800s, in the West-End. When people are fighting over a loaf of bread, the one who is Christian will give up his bread to the other. It is not easy to do something like that, when one is hungry. The decline of Judeo-Christian values would then be even faster. 
Take into effect that the Jews were banished to the pagan country of Babylon and all kinds of idolatry would be incorporated into the Jew's already defiled lives.
It was necessary that Isaiah preached this message of warning 700 years before the coming of the Messiah, so that at least two people were willing to take of an innocent baby, and a remnant would be susceptible in hearing the message of salvation from this baby, 30 years later.

::*2 Blessed is the man who does this,*::

You are blessed when you follow the Lord's commands. In those days, 700BC up 30AD, I suspect not many were. I have read in books and heard in sermons that they had abandoned their idols, that was a good start. The banishment #todo/opzoeken  ballingschap, exile? 
was enough punishment for them to finally stop worshipping idols as they had done from the Exodus from Egypt until the very day they were captured by king Nebuchadnezzar. And now, having seen that none of those idols could save them and only brought them greater misfortune–in the home country where those idols were worshipped nonetheless!—they might actually started believing that God perhaps was the real deal, the Only One Who could save them. 
When He did, they probably thought that they should obey Him now. Unfortunately, it was only in this field of idolatry that they obeyed Him, not in all the other fields which God warned them about, which were also reasons for exile. 
In short it comes to what verse 1 already says: justice and righteousness. Those were the things lacking in Jewish society, before the exile and after it as well. Not only in Jewish society, but also in Western and Asian society, possibly with an exception every now and then. It is said of Cyrus for example that he did a very good job at stimulating the economy giving the people prosperity. 
In Western societies the justice system seems not to work very well, even though it is very modern and in some sense based on the Bible. But there is the problem, the problem is that it is not fully based on the Bible. The people's own *humanistic* feelings discount the implementation of Biblical Law in society. Death penalties have become life sentences of 15 to 30 years, and in rare (according to me) case literally life-long. Possibilities for parole, however, are much sooner than that and so criminals get out really quick. 
Corporal punishment has been abolished, because the problem with criminals lies in their minds or even in their genes—according to Western medicine and psychologists. Punishing the body therefore has no use. We can see the outcome of their methods by the decreasing rate of recidivism return to criminal activities. 
Indeed, it is not the body, literally, that sinned, but not the mind either. It is the soul who has bad longings, but the mind *can* be controlled by the body. If the body tells the mind that that place is hot and that the body will burn when touching that flame, the mind will not *want* to touch it. 
Corporal punishment has been deemed as old fashioned. Perhaps one day "punishment" in any form will be deemed old fashioned. 

Perhaps one day "Sabbath" in any form will be deemed old fashioned. #todo af te maken
Now would seem like the time for it. From a young age on and everywhere in the world I have heard that busy-ness is killing us people, especially Christians. Christians have always been busy because the harvest is great and the workers are few, but in those busy days where efficiency has become possible, Christians take up even more work, flying to countries further away at higher speeds, with faster working computers and faster Internet, using autocorrection so that typing more in the same time and at more times—on the toilet and while waiting in line—has become possible now. 
The Sabbath is needed more than ever. Not only Christians are working harder, the devil too. The problem, however, is that the devil will not get tired. The media are around us now 24 hours, live, from all time zones, just like temptations such as Netflix and pornography, shopping and attractive commercials to make us spend our money—or simply get distracted from doing our work. 
We need the strength to withhold us from such temptations, to not give into it, and this strength is not from ourselves but from God. We need a whole day to recharge from what happened the previous week and we need enough power for the coming week.

This power can only come from God and when we are in contact with Him. We are only able to contact Him when we become silent. God is still King and He will not "wait" for us until we have time—in the sense that He will shout through all of the noise in our heads. No, we have to make time for Him, in the sense that we have to be calm first, and then God will speak. 
Of course, in reality, God has been waiting for years for us to come to Him, because He is humble, but He is still King and should be treated as such! 

*3 Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the Lord say,*
*“The Lord will surely separate me from his people”;*
*and let not the eunuch say,*
*“Behold, I am a dry tree.”*
*4 For thus says the Lord:*
*“To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,*
*who choose the things that please me*
*and hold fast my covenant,*

Three times in this chapter God mentions the Sabbath as requirement for being God's child. This is not a coincidence. How important is the Sabbath? Why has it been named specifically over all Ten Commandments? 
In other places we see how Israel worships idols and thereby trespass the second and the ninth #todo/opzoeken  commandment (idolatry and adultery with other gods). 
Sometimes a whole chapter is based on a specific sin, such as sin or worries, or about how spouses should treat each other, but I have not heard any command from the Ten Commands specifically repeated so many times. It really is important, but it is overshadowed too often and its importance, the reason why at least, is not understood.

The Sabbath is of such important that even eunuchs, who were previously banished #todo/opzoeken  uitgesloten van 
from ever becoming part of the Kingdom, could now become children of God, as long as they first
* Keep the Sabbath
* choose the things that please God 
* hold the commands in the covenant of Moses #todo/opzoeken ? 

The Sabbath is not only a moment of rest, it is the time where we have contact with God. At other times, it is as if God is having contact with us, that He is sending voice messages (when we hear Him), text messages (when we receive short snippets from Him or through other people) and e-mails (when we read His book). But actually seeing Him, face to face, sharing a meal with Him, that is only on a Sabbath. It could be any day, it could be multiple days, but at the very least it is on the Sabbath, i.e. at least once a week. 
I must say that I am not doing this. I am taking my rest. I am trying to stay aware—but not even always *doing* it, just staying *aware*—that I do not allow any distractions on Sunday and Monday so that I am able to hear the voice of God. 
Also, if my body is physically aching, or if I am mentally stressed because of everything that has been going on in previous week, I cannot get to rest very easily either. That is why I need an evening of rest, such as Sunday evening, and then Monday to actually get *enjoy* my rest. 

A new insight (for me) from MacSBNnkjv is that the Sabbath is what separates the Israelites from other peoples. It is true that no other culture or nation has Sabbaths where it is forbidden to work. I am not even sure of other cultures where there is a weekend where people rest voluntarily. It seems like other cultures, before Christianity was widespread, worked all week long and rested whenever they could. 
#todo/opzoeken  Did the Chinese have a weekend?

*5 I will give in my house and within my walls*
*a monument and a name*
*better than sons and daughters;*
*I will give them an everlasting name*
*that shall not be cut off.*

In God's house, that is either his Temple of His Church, and within His walls, that is the Law, God will give a monument and a name. What would that mean? 
One way to pass on your name would be through your sons and daughters. They can spread the word about you and they themselves, can be witnesses to the world about you.
But humans are fallible, they will provide wrong testimony and show people the wrong image of you. Sons and daughters may be cut off for this very reason. 
God is too holy to let His whole image depend on the Israelites. They have already almost destroyed His image in the desert, by worshipping the golden calves. The Israelites have by this time already given the world a bad image, one that does not arouse fear in the enemy's hearts. They Philistines and the people from Jericho used to fear God for the stories heard about Him. But now, after having lost so many times from their enemies, even small countries, and after so much struggle from within the country (two countries, Israel and Judah to be precise) all fear for the Lord has dissipated, in the first place because it had gone from the Israelites' hearts. 

What then is this Name and monument. Is it the Name that Christians—i.e. little Christs— are bearing? I would say the Christians of all ages had smudged the Name of God alike. Some have given it a good name, like Hudson Taylor, but even William Booth has some negative records on his account, even within his own family when they ostracized any who would leave the Army of Salvation to work anywhere else—although it could be the Wikipedia is not reliable there. 
In general though Christians bear Christ's Name, and Christ Himself will never be cut off, but I do not know if He can be considered a monument. He is more like the event that took place and the monument is that to remember Him by. The written Word would be a good monument. It bears His Name, it is within the walls, i.e. the Law, it is pure—even though it contains records of immorality and innocent bloodshed, but all of human doing and nothing of God's—and it will last forever. However, though the Word will never be cut off, the Word cannot really be given a name, because it is not a person. It is referring to Jesus, but the Bible cannot have a name. 
No, this name is given to the eunuchs, because from the previous verses it can be seen that this is a promise from God to them, because they cannot have children (cf. "a dry tree"). God will first of all accept them, which is the greatest gift, and instead of children to bear their name He will give them something better than a fallible name spread through humans—He will give them an *everlasting* monument *in God's house and within His walls*. 
Still, the question remains what this monument would then be. The first thing that comes to mind are the priests who have sworn celibacy. They serve God and they have no children. Some of them have their own legacy, such as Brother Lawrence or the Catholic priest from Belgium. But I do not think this is the answer, for they are not actual eunuchs nor do I see any resemblance of an everlasting monument. 

#biblestudy/questions What is this monument?

#biblestudy/questions Contradiction in the Bible when it says the eunuchs cannot be and then can be included? 

::*6 “And the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord,*::
::*to minister to him, to love the name of the Lord,*::
::*and to be his servants,*::
::*everyone who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it,*::
::*and holds fast my covenant—*::

Again, the Sabbath here is mentioned as one of the conditions. One might think that it is written here because it indicates that those who want to become His child has to keep the smallest Laws (i.e. that of the Sabbath) and the biggest ones (i.e. His covenant), in short *everything*. However, I do not think this is what is meant here. First of all, it is not works that save, but faith (cf. Romans 3:24), second of all, verse 6 seems to be a list of prerequisites to be accepted to God's holy mountain. I would rephrase it as follows. 
#todo/opzoeken difference between paraphrase and rephrase
1. You must choose the Lord's side 
2. You must serve Him, i.e. work for His Kingdom 
3. You must love Him and do all of this out of this love for Him
4. You must serve the world (loving humans as well as God)
5. You must take care of your own body and relationship with God through rest and silence
6. You must abide by the rules given through the Law

As can be seen from this list, the Sabbath is not something that can be deleted from these prerequisites. #todo/opzoeken  difference between prerequisite and requisite

::*7 these I will bring to my holy mountain,*::
::*and make them joyful in my house of prayer;*::
::*their burnt offerings and their sacrifices*::
::*will be accepted on my altar;*::
::*for my house shall be called a house of prayer*::
::*for all peoples.”*:: #biblestudy/memorization/todo

The Lord is gracious, good and kind. He takes care of all peoples and He has opened to door to all nations. *Halleluja*, praise His Name! For without God's graciousness, we would never be able to stand here in front of Him. I myself am a stranger and a foreigner. The Chinese people would never have known God if God would not be willing to accept us. We have forgone this opportunity through our forefather rooted in Noah's son, Ham, and his son, Canaan. But now, the Sinite people, i.e. the Japanse, the Korean and Chinese, are one of the fastest growing peoples. All of this is due to God's grace. Praise be to His Name. 

*8 The Lord God,*
*who gathers the outcasts of Israel, declares,*
*“I will gather yet others to him*
*besides those already gathered.”*

The previous verse, verse 7, was meant for the outcasts of Israel, which are the people of Israel who have been cast away by the Assyrians and Babylonians. I think it includes those who chose to stay in Persia after the return as well.
I am not sure at what moment God is speaking here. It says "*already* gathered", but at the moment of writing Israel was not in exile yet. So I think this is a future saying, i.e. something that God will say in the future after the three returns from Persia. In other words, God will continue to strive in order to get all the Jews home, and then all other peoples as well which is written at the end of verse 7 (cf. "all peoples"). 

**Israel's Irresponsible Leaders**
*9 All you beasts of the field, come to devour—*
*all you beasts in the forest.*
*10 His watchmen are blind;*
*they are all without knowledge;*
*they are all silent dogs;*
*they cannot bark,*
*dreaming, lying down,*
*loving to slumber.*

Most likely Isaiah is taking the Word here again, because he uses "His" which would refer to God. Isaiah is calling upon the beasts of the field and in the forest, which are likely the enemies of Israel, the nations surrounding Israel who want to devour it. Isaiah is call them out because the watchmen, as the title of this pericope says, the irresponsible leaders, are blind and asleep. 
Why would Isaiah call out enemies to destroy his own people? Would he not be a traitor then? No. He is doing it because of God's will. Irresponsible leaders, corrupt and immoral dictators or anyone in that position who should not be in that position, should be taken off their positions. The Israelites cannot do that, because they need to obey the Law, which says to submit to their leaders and to God #todo/opzoeken which verse, that Paul is also referring to
, but God can do it by instructing other nations who do not have to submit to Israel's leaders. 
Isaiah is inviting them to come over and giving arguments to convince them of how easy it is in verse 10. The leaders are not smart and they have no power, not even to bark, which is not even indicative of a dog's power. 

*11 The dogs have a mighty appetite;*
*they never have enough.*
*But they are shepherds who have no understanding;*
*they have all turned to their own way,*
*each to his own gain, one and all.*
*12 “Come,” they say, “let me get wine;*
*let us fill ourselves with strong drink;*
*and tomorrow will be like this day,*
*great beyond measure.”*

In verse 11 more arguments about their weakness, if the above was not convincing enough. Sometimes knowing that an enemy is weak, is not enough to start a war. The question is also how much spoil there is, how much the war will cost in human lives and resources. In this case, Israel hardly had any spoils left due to what had been given to Sennacherib of Assyria, then forcibly taken from it when it would not and could not pay anymore (until Hezekiah prayed for relief and God listened to his prayer) and what had been given to "allies", such as Egypt to save them from the Assyrians (which they could not, because they themselves were subdued). 
So the material spoils might not have been attractive enough to invade a country for and leave an opening in the defense of one's own country. The land of Israel, on the other hand, was fertile and diverse, for milk and honey, that is enough water for grass (for the cows and sheep for milk) and flowers (for bees for honey).
Also, the intelligent men and beautiful women were good spoil. From the time of Abraham on we see that the women of the people of God were created with such beauty that a king would take a 60-year old Sara into his harem and another one would do the same when she was 85 years old. A village chief's son was prepared to let all of the men of his village be circumcised for one daughter of Jakob. Out of all the women in Persia, Esther (or Hadassa) was chosen to become king Xerxes' wife, his *main* wife I presume. 
But still, if that was not convincing enough, perhaps the surrounding nations would invade Israel because the current leaders were corrupt. They were bad leaders, only looking out for their own interests and drunk all day long. Would this perhaps appeal to anyone's moral values, enough to save this people from its obnoxious leaders?
