# Isaiah 12 (NIV) 
**Songs of Praise**
*1 In that day you will say:*
*“I will praise you, Lord.*
*Although you were angry with me,*
*your anger has turned away*
*and you have comforted me.*
*2 Surely God is my salvation;*
*I will trust and not be afraid.*
*The Lord, the Lord himself, is my strength and my defense;*
*he has become my salvation. ”*
*3 With joy you will draw water*
*from the wells of salvation.*

God knows us so much, and He knows that we will come back to God and admit that He was right. Of course this is not for everyone, but those who do come back to God are blessed. They are the ones who will realize that God's anger has turned away and who can lie in His comfort. 
There is nothing so bad as running away from home and knowing your parents are still angry at you, having no place to go home to. This is the feeling the prodigal son had when he was in a foreign country. He did everything he could not to go home, for he feared facing the anger and shame of his father. But what a relieve it was when he turned out not be anger. A huge load fell off of his shoulders.
I remember being very angry at my son Nathan because he did not clean up his toys and he refused to. He was only two at the time. I yelled at him and when he still did not listen I gave him a smack in the face. Now that was not the right thing to do for several reasons, but aside from that, even after he saw I was angry, he wanted to be comforted by me. He knew that things were alright again after I comforted him. He needed this confirmation. 
We need the same thing from our Heavenly Father and as Isaiah says, God will give us this confirmation. We just need to stick around long enough to see that his anger has turned away. For some have already left their homes, never to return and never to see that their father's anger has turned away. 

*4 In that day you will say:*
*“Give praise to the Lord, proclaim his name;*
*make known among the nations what he has done,*
*and proclaim that his name is exalted.*
*5 Sing to the Lord, for he has done glorious things;*
*let this be known to all the world.*
*6 Shout aloud and sing for joy, people of Zion,*
*for great is the Holy One of Israel among you. ”*

There will once be a day where we will praise our God again and not only that, we will also let other nations know what God has done. This is a time where a little of this happens. Over the ages churches have praised and proclaimed His Name and also made known what God has done. They have done it both in the church as out on the streets and all over the world through missionaries. 
The movement has shifted from the West to the East where we see that churches and the hunger for the Gospel is growing, whereas in the West it is heavily declining and where it is not declining, we see a shift towards liberal moral values.
