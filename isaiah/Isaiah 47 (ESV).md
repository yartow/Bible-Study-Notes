# Isaiah 47 (ESV) 
**The Humiliation of Babylon**
*1 Come down and sit in the dust,*
*O virgin daughter of Babylon;*
*sit on the ground without a throne,*
*O daughter of the Chaldeans!*
*For you shall no more be called*
*tender and delicate.*
*2 Take the millstones and grind flour,*
*put off your veil,*
*strip off your robe, uncover your legs,*
*pass through the rivers.*
*3 Your nakedness shall be uncovered,*
*and your disgrace shall be seen.*
*I will take vengeance,*
*and I will spare no one.*

The Lord is taking action. When He does, He spares no one, except for the innocent. He can postpone His action to some, but in this case it is the time for God to take action. Any postponement would have occurred already. 
So now God is saying to a princess, for whom God does not have any respect—for what is a throne of a nation to God? God created the nation, the institution of rulers and this "princess" from the very start of her existence—to sit down in the dust, to work with her hands, to undress so that her disgrace shall be seen (by the whole world). 
This princess, Babylon, did something wrong and now she must pay for it. Whether she pretended to be the virgin daughter who never hurts anyone—for she was a mistress, how can anyone be one while staying a virgin?—or whether she actually was, she now has done an (almost) unforgivable act of invading the kingdom of Israel and even more so, defying God. That is their sin.

*4 Our Redeemer—the Lord of hosts is his name—*
*is the Holy One of Israel.*
*5 Sit in silence, and go into darkness,*
*O daughter of the Chaldeans;*
*for you shall no more be called*
*the mistress of kingdoms.*

Perhaps this word "mistress" means something else here. Except for extra-marital affairs it could also mean that she (in fact) was the master of kingdoms. Why the female version? Perhaps because she did it in a non physical violent way, poetically seen. Of course in practice Babylon did kill off a lot of people, but perhaps they killed much less than other empires had and with much less atrocities, like the Assyrians had done. Babylon perhaps destroyed one country and then made deals with other countries to give up themselves and give up the lives of the smart and elitarian people (like Daniel and his friends) and getting the people, knowledge and technology of Babylon in return to live in their land, as I expect a lot of Babylonians moved from Babylon to Israel as well (to become Samaritans afterwards). 
So she (Babylon) could make her enemies sell their soul to her without using violence. #todo/opzoeken I do not know how Nebuchadnezzar did that.

*6 I was angry with my people;*
*I profaned my heritage;*
*I gave them into your hand;*
*you showed them no mercy;*
*on the aged you made your yoke exceedingly heavy.*

In these verses it becomes clear that mistress refers to the word "master", rather than that Babylon is female. There is a reason, however, why God refers to Babylon as a woman rather than a man. It probably also has to do with the fact that a mistress sleeps with someone already married. That does not make her a whore, but in Revelations the final Babylon is called the whore #todo/opzoeken  or is it the whore from Babylon? 
, which is usually female. 
So there are two things that can be learned from this thing. The mistress is both a master and one who sleeps with a married person. The latter points to Israel, who was already married to God. However, this analogy might not be fitting, even though Israel chose to stay in Babylon c.q. Persia after Cyrus released the Jews, because Israel is always noted as the bride (female) of God and Babylon is female as well. 

God says here that He gave His people to Babylon so that they could be punished by her and my theory is confirmed now, that Babylon punished Israel too hard. They did two things, they showed no mercy and they made the yoke "exceedingly heavy" on the *aged*. 
God has compassion for the weaker ones in society, as He has always shown in His Word—the beggars, the imprisoned, the handicapped, the mentally ill, the widowed and the aged. So I think it is not only the "exceedingly heavy" part for which God punished the Babylonians, it is also the "aged" part, because they showed no respect, even if the aged had to be punished. 

*7 You said, “I shall be mistress forever,”*
::*so that you did not lay these things to heart*::
::*or remember their end.*::

Babylon became so conceited with her mastership, that she—just like Nebuchadnezzar—forgot who gave her this power. She thought she would be mistress forever. That is the reason she did not care about the lack of mercy and unrighteousness against the aged or what would happen to the Jews. She did not think she had to be accountable to anyone. When humans think like that, the worst will come out of them. That is what happened to all of the dictators. Most of them were communist and hence atheists, therefore they thought they were the highest power of their state and had no one to be accountable to. God is needed, if only to keep humans in check. 
*What about Muslim or Hindu leaders?*, you might think. As for all of them, they have gods that do not condemn violence. 

*8 Now therefore hear this, you lover of pleasures,*
*who sit securely,*
*who say in your heart,*
*“I am, and there is no one besides me;*
*I shall not sit as a widow*
*or know the loss of children”:*

This confirms that Babylon thought no one was equal as she and that her power would never be gone. She thought even more than I thought she would think about herself—she thought she we would never encounter trouble, such as the loss of her husband or children. 
The question then arises who are her husband and children. Are those the king and the people of Babylon? #biblestudy/questions

*9 These ::two:: things shall come to you*
*in a moment, in one day;*
*the loss of children and widowhood*
*shall come upon you in full measure,*
*in spite of your many sorceries*
*and the great power of your enchantments.*

However, it is exactly those two things that Babylon loses. If one of those two is actually the king, then the "virgin" Babylon is not referring to Nebuchadnezzar, but perhaps to the country or the whole nation including its people. The sorrow felt then would not be felt by one person only, but by the whole nation. It is the whole people of Babylon that has sinned and practiced sorcery. All of them, just like Japan, murdered and slaughtered people, and raped and tortured them before killing them, not because of peer pressure or the cultivation of hatred against the Chinese or so-called weaker races, but purely because they were evil themselves. 
I cannot say anything about the women and children, for they were not on the battlefield. In the Bible too not much is said about the sins of women and children of Israel and Babylon against their fellow people or against other nations. There is, however, a story about two women, in the time if king Ahab, wanting to eat their own children and having actually eaten one of them. Such was the cruelty of even the Israelites, let alone of the people of Babylon who do not have God as their god. 

*10 You felt secure in your wickedness;*
*you said, “No one sees me”;*
::*your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray,*::
*and you said in your heart,*
*“I am, and there is no one besides me.”*

And with the Japanese as well, they felt secure. Even at the end of WWII, the soldiers most probably did not know they were at their end of ammunition and supplies, but they felt secure of winning. They did not know that the only reason the United States did not wipe them out was because of the civilians living in Japan. They used two bombs, who did not even function well—only 10 percent of the power of this atomic bomb was used, due to the inexperience with this technology—and they probably had many more and many bigger ones. 
The United States could have lasted much longer without running out of money and hence supplies. They had ten times as many people, I am sure they even withheld many of them. Japan was deemed to lose, but America watched and withheld herself in order to save civilians and perhaps allow evacuations. 
The resistance of Japan against the United States, like man before God, was futile. 

One question that pops in my mind is, was Japan attacking China on behalf of God? Were the Chinese, like the Jewish, disobedient of God? China was never a Jewish or Christian country to begin with but good things were happening with many missionaries coming over even more churches (perhaps) being planted. But with the rise of communism—and even before that with the Boxer's rebellion—it seems that China was punished for these sins. The killing of Christian missionaries, including their wives and children, and communism which including the killing and denigration of many innocent people, igniting a hypocritical socialist and dictatorial country with corruption flooding all layers of the government—perhaps it was these two things where China crossed the line of God's patience.
I cannot draw this picture exactly from the picture sketched here of the Jews, because the Chinese are not God's children nor were they exiled. I must say that throughout history it does seem *like* God favored the Chinese more than others, with the many natural resources they had, knowledge, philosophy and art—as if they were blessed by God and a blessing to many other countries with the inventions they created. The most important things, the book press, paper, gun powder and the compass encompassed (no pun intended) them and the world to globalize trade and cultures, food and languages, which spurred up a world economy as great as it is now, all beginning with these inventions and of course the invention of creating iron from ores. 

*11 But evil shall come upon you,*
*which you will not know how to charm away;*
*disaster shall fall upon you,*
*for which you will not be able to atone;*
*and ruin shall come upon you suddenly,*
*of which you know nothing.*
*12 Stand fast in your enchantments*
*and your many sorceries,*
*with which you have labored from your youth;*
*perhaps you may be able to succeed;*
*perhaps you may inspire terror.*
*13 You are wearied with your many counsels;*
*let them stand forth and save you,*
*those who divide the heavens,*
*who gaze at the stars,*
*who at the new moons make known*
*what shall come upon you.*

The Babylonians gazed at the stars and hoped to receive prophecies from their gods, not knowing it is our God, the Lord YHWH who created the stars and controls the movement and brightness of every star. So whatever the stargazers were looking at, they were only seeing what God was telling them. Perhaps one of the magi in the nativity story was a Babylonian, who was passed on the "technique" of interpreting the stars, and just like the Chinese (and most likely the Japanese as well) knew a lot about astrology. 
The irony of the Babylonians seeking for answers in the stars, to know what is coming, is that they would later on, after approximately 400 years, read in the stars that a king would come, Jesus Christ, Who would also save the world, but they did not read about the disaster that would come overnight by Cyrus the Persian, even though Cyrus is a foreshadow of this King. 
So the king who would save this part of the world by destroying the current king is the king who foreshadows the King Who would save the entire world. 

*14 Behold, they are like stubble;*
*the fire consumes them;*
*they cannot deliver themselves*
*from the power of the flame.*
*No coal for warming oneself is this,*
*no fire to sit before!*
*15 Such to you are those with whom you have labored,*
*who have done business with you from your youth;*
*they wander about, each in his own direction;*
*there is no one to save you.*

The Japanese have always been proud of what they have been able to achieve. Though not inventing things perse, but rather perfecting things of other cultures, such as sushi, blacksmith—both technologies inherited from China—none of these can save them. They are famous for their "peaceful" and Zen Buddhist places #tags/religion/buddhism , along with Feng Shui—also inherited from China—both of which did not give them any "luck" either in the two World Wars #tags/historic events/wwii# #tags/historic events/wwi# or in the period thereafter. 
The ones they did business with, among which the Dutch and the Taiwanese, did not help them, as the Japanese were truly too immoral, apart from the fact that the Dutch had their hands full on the war themselves and the Taiwanese were probably incapable of helping themselves, let alone others. The Koreans and Chinese were against Japan, because of what they had done, just like the rest of South-East Asia. 
So it probably was with Babylon as well. It had conquered many if not all countries in the Middle East down to Africa, as far as Ethiopia, and in the north perhaps Turkey and Greece. But none of those countries were grateful for what Babylon had done, even if they had brought new technology to stimulate the economy, which—as far as I know—was not the case in Israel, for farms were unattended, because of the lack of people.
