# Isaiah 50 (ESV) 
**Israel's Sin and the Servant's Obedience**
*1 Thus says the Lord:*
*“Where is your mother's certificate of divorce,*
*with which I sent her away?*
*Or which of my creditors is it*
*to whom I have sold you?*
*Behold, for your iniquities you were sold,*
*and for your transgressions your mother was sent away.*

I though this was rhetorical in the sense that God would say that He did not send anyone away, because that is a bad thing, just like selling one's children, and God does not do bad things. However, He has done that for a reason. **Update.** As MacArthur remarks,  the mother was sent away indeed, but not with a certificate of divorce, and the children were sold, but only temporary. 
The children, the Jews, were sent away for their iniquities, that is understandable to  me, but the mother—which are probably the idols—was sent away because of the transgressions of the Jews! 
Are the Jews in this context God's wife or God's children? And why does God mention "*His* creditors" while He does not owe anything to anyone? These questions make it very hard to interpret this verse without the right answers. Of course I do not have all the answers and even if I had them, I would not know whether I have the correct ones. I can only write down my answer based on what I think God tells me. 
This then is what I think it means. These idols do not exist so they cannot be divorced. These idols are images of the devil. It is not like God was married to them and so could divorce them. He was only "married to the Israelites". Reasoning from there on, His children are perhaps the next generation Israelites. So God is saying that in the previous generation their mother was divorced because of "your" transgressions, that is, He broke the covenant He had with them of keeping the land of Israel, and even after that the current generation still lived in transgressions and so He sold them to the Babylonians. 
The "your" in "your transgressions" then refers to the *Jews'* transgressions. Both the mother and the children are Jews and so in this case it does not matter whether Isaiah writes "your" or "your mother's" transgressions, because once rendered this would be (translated to) "the Jews' transgressions".

*2 Why, when I came, was there no man;*
*why, when I called, was there no one to answer?*
*Is my hand shortened, that it cannot redeem?*
*Or have I no power to deliver?*

When God came—I do not know in which form He came, I mean not the medium, but with which perceived intention, did He come and deliver a message of rebuke or did He offer to save everyone?—no man was there to answer. I suppose God had called more than just Isaiah, either through dreams and visions or through His written Word. Of course I would say it is understandable if God would call someone in his dream, assuming he knows for certain that it is God, and that He would tell this person to endure some punishment, that this person would neglect His command, because who would want to have a punishment? On the other hand, it is a real encounter with God and if one's heart is open, I believe that this person will really do whatever it is that God asks of Him. 
Paul—Saul at the time—was a murderer and persecutor of Christians, but still He fell on his knees for Jesus and obeyed His commands to visit Gamaliel #todo/opzoeken  in Damascus, not knowing what would happen there. He visited Rome though knowing he would die there. The same for the other disciples, the same for many of the missionaries who went overseas and got killed. Adoniram Judson who went to Burma (Myanmar) even said to the one who advised him that he "might not come back" that he was not planning on coming back but that he would go wherever God would lead him. 
Now in this case only Isaiah listened to and obeyed God. Whether it is a punishment or the hard task of telling others of Gods forewarnings and promises, no one came up and told God that he was ready to serve Him and obey His commands. 
God rhetorically asked if He was not able to save them and whether that was the reason people did not reach out to Him or respond to Him, but I think He was serious in that people actually thought that. Paul responded because He knew God is greater than everything and that He could save not only him, but all of Israel as well. 
Concluding, a man listens to another not because that which he says is pleasing to him, but because he trusts that man's power, either to punish or reward him. 

*Behold, by my rebuke I dry up the sea,*
*I make the rivers a desert;*
*their fish stink for lack of water*
*and die of thirst.*
*3 I clothe the heavens with blackness*
*and make sackcloth their covering.”*

Now God shows His overpowering might, which transcends the forces of nature and goes beyond life and death. He changes the sea into a dry land and dries up rivers to become deserts. 
How hard is it to dry up a river? Very hard. As mentioned a few chapters ago it is unimaginable how much water is in river and flows through it every second. All of the people of Israel and Jordan, who live by the Jordan river, could not even dry up the Jordan, even though the Jordan is only a small river and it hardly rains anywhere along the Jordan. Granted, the river level might have dropped a few inches or even meters, but it is far from hitting the bottom. Granted, this has impacted the Dead Sea, but there are other factors involved there as well, such as factories extracting the salt from the Dead Sea and the high salinity of the water which probably increases the rate of evaporation, however the river still is far from dry. 
I would say, especially without technology, it is impossible for humans to dry up a river. If it dries up, it is through evaporation, and not through human effort. 

The same argument goes for covering the world with darkness. Batman and the government have tried to do this in the animated film *Batman vs. Superman* and *The Matrix*, respectively, but in real life this is impossible. Not nearly impossible, but *literally* impossible.

*4 The Lord God has given me*
*the tongue of those who are taught,*
*that I may know how to sustain with a word*
*him who is weary.*

Jesus was given, but Isaiah as well, the gift of speaking to build up weary people. #todo/opzoeken  bemoediging Perhaps this is what is referred to by the spiritual gift of encouragement. 
Many find encouragement in Jesus' words whenever the read the Bible and open to one of His spoken words. 
What many do not realize is that Jesus *is* the Word that has power to create, although in human form, and that He creates through every word *spoken*. Sustenance is a part of creation for without it things break down. One whose heart is broken, though figuratively, can have a newly *created* heart by Jesus. 
Do not forget that it is through *creation* that God gives us all of His blessings. He *creates* happiness and peace, He does not redistribute it by taking it from others. 

*Morning by morning he awakens;*
*he awakens my ear*
*to hear as those who are taught.*
*5 The Lord God has opened my ear,*
*and I was not rebellious;*
*I turned not backward.*

Once again the phrase "those who are taught" is used. Apparent God has respect for those who are taught, even though He Himself gave them the ability to read and learn things. 
Those who are willing to learn have a certain openness in their hearts, they wish to learn new things. Of course there are people who read and learn, just to get power over others, but I do not think it is those God is referring to here. He is most likely referring to those who are neutral and open to theories even if it contradicts their own world vision. 
In verse 5 Jesus, I think, hence says that He was not rebellious—and that is the exact attitude we should have. Whatever God asks of us, whether it is teaching or—as in the next verses—punishment, we should not turn backwards but rather forward and let ourselves be punished, and sometimes—or oftentimes—it is through punishment that we can learn, just like Jesus had to learn how it felt to be ashamed and to feel human pain. 

*6 I gave my back to those who strike,*
*and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard;*
*I hid not my face*
*from disgrace and spitting.*

Obedience is the key to getting God's respect. He loves you indefinitely and unconditionally, He *is* just and He *is* mercy, independent of what you have done, but respect and trust must be earned.
Real obedience is shown when you are asked to do something painful to you, when you have to sacrifice something to God. 
Jesus took it to the max. He not only let Himself be struck and let people pull on His beard, but He did not even hide His face. He showed His face, not *so that* #todo/opzoeken  difference between *opdat* and *zodat* in English
but "zodat" people could disgrace Him and spit on Him. 

If no object of disgrace is present, disgrace can never happen, but then the sacrifice can never be given either. If you never evangelize, no one can ever disgrace you or mock at you for your belief, you will need to show your face and face the possibility that people will spit on it. 

*7 But the Lord God helps me;*
*therefore I have not been disgraced;*
*therefore I have set my face like a flint,*
*and I know that I shall not be put to shame.*

I do not know whether this is a literal promise to us as well, I think not, because I can think of examples where people were disgraced, but this is for sure a figurative promise. Jesus knows He has not been disgraced in God's eyes, if any He has been exalted to the highest heaven #todo/opzoeken  heaven or heavens and where is this in the Bible? 
Because of this knowledge He could set His face like flint, like stone, not only hard, but the possibility to become sharp as well. What happens when a flint stone is hit: pieces of it break off and leave sharp edges. Anyone who then touches it will be cut. But this might be a little of reading into the text, for perhaps that is not what the author or God has meant. 
The rocky part is what it is about. Just show your face as if it is rock and know that you will not be put to shame. ::No matter how hard people hit, they cannot hit the grace out of you.::  #quotes/church
They cannot put you to shame if you are standing higher/taller #todo/opzoeken  then they are. It is just like when you are trying to make a famous person to a laughing stock. You will not succeed unless everyone joins you. If you do it by yourself, you yourself becomes the laughing stock. In this case the world is not nearly *everyone*, there are many more beings in heaven including people who died, angels and of course the Triune God Himself who is One but who does not measure in quantities but in qualities—and so should we—so His look on us is worth more than the look of all people on this world combined. 

*8 He who vindicates me is near.*
*Who will contend with me?*
*Let us stand up together.*
*Who is my adversary?*
*Let him come near to me.*

If you want to be with Jesus you will need to vindicate Him, that is apologize or defend His actions. Jesus is *not* guilty. Would you claim that before a court if you were in His time? Would you claim this out on the streets? Even Peter, the bold one, did not dare to. But if you want to be near Jesus you will need to do so. 
What about our current age then? How can we talk about Jesus when He is already in heaven? There is nothing to vindicate, right? Wrong. Still there are people who accuse Jesus of several things. They try different tactics so they do not have to believe in God.
Their first tactic is to say that Jesus never claimed to be God. Their second tactic is proving that God (whether He is Triune or not) is an unrighteous God. Their third tactic is to show scientific evidence that God does not exist and that God does not *need* to exist for the world to come into existence out of nothing. 
Are you willing to defy all three challenges? All three have been taken on by Christians, so you do not need to be a historian, a philosopher or a scientist to counter the arguments of atheists and anti-theists. You would only need to look up what has already been written by the likes of people like Josh McDowell, William Lane Craig and Kent Hovind and their respective or affiliated websites to get the information you need, study it and make it your own. This is the effort you will need to put in it. God will provide the situations where you can use it if you are willing and ready for it. 

Then comes the second part, *contending* with Jesus. If you are willing to take a stand against anti-theists you will suffer blows. God will uphold, but you will be hurt and they will shame you. Some will leave you or you might lose your job or something else over it. 
Stay strong and know that you are not alone in this. Jesus contends with You, He already has and He knows and feels your pain. 

Then comes the part where the adversary comes. Jesus invites him to come near to Him. Why is that? Does Jesus ask Him to come near so that He can forgive him? Or does Jesus mean that He is ready for the fight? 

*9 Behold, the Lord God helps me;*
*who will declare me guilty?*
*Behold, all of them will wear out like a garment;*
*the moth will eat them up.*

Jesus asks who will declare Him guilty. It is a callout to the world, not a question, for He already knows who is on His side. He adds to that that God is on *His* side. Smart people should know they cannot win the fight to begin with. Smart people would refrain from fighting. Even if they do not root for Jesus, they would at least stay quiet and perhaps join the winning party.  
But instead, the antitheists so long to deceive not only themselves but the rest of the world as well so that they can have power and dominion over their own lives and over other's. They are mistaken, in the first place, because they have renounced the authority of God (cf. *Does man need God?* by Ravi Zacharias #tags/books#), the moral standard of God, a fixed and #todo/opzoeken/engels niet aan te passen definition of what is good and wrong, which has shot them in their own feet. Now, everything they say, could be wrong as well!  

Go for it, Jesus says. You will only tire yourself out. You will be worn out like garment, starting with dust in the air, which unfortunately spreads very far into every nook and cranny and is hard to fully remove unless one goes to those nooks and crannies, but eventually there will be holes in the garment and the fabric will be fully gone in the end.  

The antitheists are wearing themselves out. They are writing books which do not stay in history. Dawkins' #tags/famouspeople book #tags/books *The God Delusion*, though a bestseller, is hardly ever referenced by antitheists and is not well received even by antitheists who expected more of him. The same thing goes for Hitchens' #tags/books *God is not Great*, both books being referred to by Christian apologists for their arguments only to refute them later on.  
But the question is, are Christians and especially Christian apologists wearing themselves out as well?  
I hope not. Once famous books such as *Evidence that Demands a Verdict*  #tags/books by McDowell and perhaps other books by Ravi Zacharias #tags/famouspeople/christian#, Frank Turek and Lee Strobel are hardly heard referenced to in debates and seem to be buried under the load of new information from other authors or disinterest of millennials.  
However, there is a difference. The books by antitheists are buried because they have been proven to be unworthy and not able to withstand the test of time, and in this case evidence, while the Christian books, at least most of them, are based in the Bible, unbiased logical reasoning, in the sense that it is only biased by the people, not by a personal hidden longing. For it is very clear what the Christian's purpose is, namely to convert the reader, and that his reasoning based on faith as well, unlike the antitheist who claims everything to be scientific. Even those logical or philosophical gaps that have not been filled they fill in with pseudo-science such as alternative universes or made up animals or ape men, constructed from one or two bones, to prevent stating that their worldview is based on faith—and in effect, a religion—as well. 

*10 Who among you fears the Lord*
*and obeys the voice of his servant?*
*Let him who walks in darkness*
*and has no light*
*trust in the name of the Lord*
*and rely on his God.*

What matters in the end are two things: fearing the Lord and obeying Jesus. A third thing is consequential and inherent of the former two. 
Fearing the Lord indicates you put His wish and commands over all of your own longings. His wish is more important and you long for it to do his wish first, before your own, in order not only to satisfy Him, but also because you know it actually is more important for the world. It is like an army commander telling you to do a certain action while in war. He is not saying this just because He likes it, but He is saying it to strike down the enemy and win the war and save our own people. His commands are in a sense life-preserving. 
Understand that fearing the Lord and obeying Him are two sides of the same coin. You cannot do one without the other. Of course, there is the definition of *brave*, which means that *despite* your fears you still do what you should do, but the fear of the Lord means that You not only *fear* Him but *respect* Him as well. So this *fear of the Lord* defies bravery, although bravery is needed to defy the fear for the world.

*11 Behold, all you who kindle a fire,*
*who equip yourselves with burning torches!*
*Walk by the light of your fire,*
*and by the torches that you have kindled!*
*This you have from my hand:*
*you shall lie down in torment.*

Does God mean with "my hand" that the things above are the Jews' own fault and that they are punished not merely with the natural consequences, but with God's punishment as well? #biblestudy/questions

If those walking with burning torches are the ones marching towards Jesus, usually in a fashion of attacking Him, like they did in the movie *Beauty and the Beast*, Jesus is forewarning them that they will lose and lie down in torment. 
In fact, the MacArthur Bible notes say that the kindling of their torches with their own fires means that they trust in their own god and that may even be themselves. This in itself is an attack on Jesus as well, because He paid for your body. 
In the West we might not understand this. If anyone offers you a gift or some food when you are at his house, we Westerners might reject it because we do not like it or because we have just eaten, without offending the host; In the (middle) East, however, this would be an offense because that other person has prepared it especially for you. If you are a man, then you would be served this food first, while the women would be waiting in the kitchen to finish off the leftovers. This is insulting to the women and the host as well. 
Of course the host could have asked us whether we want to eat something upon arrival, but that is a cultural thing. The fact is, he has already prepared and paid for it. 
Now Jesus has done this as well, whether you asked for it or not. Better yet, Jesus does not need to ask for it, because He already knows your thoughts and He knows your needs better than you do. Nobody wants to go to hell, nobody wants to die. Even those who do want to die, want to because of some sadness, something negative at least, which they cannot resolve here on Earth because there is no way out except for death.
