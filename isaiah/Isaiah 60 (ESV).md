# Isaiah 60 (ESV) 
**The Future Glory of Israel**
*1 Arise, shine, for your light has come,*
*and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.*

The impression of the first verse is that Israel has slumbered and fallen asleep, as if having lost all hope of a Redeemer. They were not tired of waiting, but they did not think to wait anymore, for they did not have a purpose and they did not believe God's Words of the coming Redeemer. 
But God here tells the Israelites to arise because the *glory* of the Lord has risen *upon* the Israelites. The glory of the Lord is in His victory—otherwise it would not be called glory. But one's victory is another's loss. So the good thing about this glory is that it is upon the Israelites. They should be glad now.

The glory *has* risen, but darkness *shall* cover the earth. This glory is not clear when there is light. It is like putting on a flashlight in broad daylight, but it will be visible when it gets dark. 
Now God's glory is so bright, even brighter than the sun itself, and even in the Sahara one could distinguish the sun from the bright sky and not be able to look straight into it without burning one's retina. However, it is especially in countries in the north which have less sun, on some days, such as in the Netherlands and Scandinavia, where there are so much clouds that it is not visible where the sun is. Sometimes, when the clouds get dark, it is not even certain whether there is a sun, only by the fact that we can see, proves there is a sun, for where else would this light come from?
Hence the glory of God is not seen or noticed clearly by the Israelites back, nor by most of the western world right now. Countries living in the dark, on the other hand, mostly third-world countries such as South-America, Africa, and India, but also countries that are poor on a socio-economic field or have a lack of freedom, such as China, are far more susceptible of receiving the Gospel. 
The Israelites, though poor and in not only economically, but socially in dire circumstance as well, still could not see God's glory when it had risen. Perhaps Isaiah is talking about the period before captivity, or perhaps he is talking about the period just before the return of the first group to Israel. One thing is for sure, when our eyes are closed, we cannot see the glory of God, no matter whether it's dark or bright outside. 
The Israelites had their eyes closed. They had lost all hope. Or maybe they were looking the wrong way, they were setting their hopes on starting a new life in Persia. In Persia it was bright. Sure, they had to give up their religion (in the beginning, before Daniel and Esther intervened) but even later on, I expect, just like here in the West, where we can have our own religion, one becomes friends with others more easily by following them.

*2 For behold, darkness shall cover the earth,*
*and thick darkness the peoples;*
*but the Lord will arise upon you,*
*and his glory will be seen upon you.*

Soon, however, they would see the light of Persia fading away, and then the light God would be visible. That is the path they should go. 
The last line of this verse says that God's glory will even be (seen) *upon* the Israelites. So God promises even that this glory, this victory, which is God's, will also be the Israelites'. They will profit from this glory. This is of course, ultimately referring to the glory of Jesus Christ in defeating the Satan on his turf, but in the near future it is the doom of the kingdom (although it would not be wrong to say empire) of Babylon and Persia. Later this would even refer to rest of the kingdoms, that is of the Ottomans, the Greeks and Romans (and others I have forgotten or do not know about), but the Jewish kingdom would always stay standing—and it still has. 

*3 And nations shall come to your light,*
*and kings to the brightness of your rising.*
*4 Lift up your eyes all around, and see;*
*they all gather together, they come to you;*

Other countries will see the light. They do not know that it is the glory of God, but they do know it gives them hope. When all other countries are in darkness, they can see the light of Israel. 
How I long for that day and I want say that it this day has already come—but alas, it has not. In the vast area of the Middle East where there is a shortage of water, Israel is the country that has the key to sustainably use the little water there is. Where Israel is surrounded by countries with high rates illiteracy and a low percentage of higher education graduates, Israel itself has one of the highest rates of the world.
#todo/opzoeken  number of universities per square km. Illiteracy rate. etc. 
Along with it, a high socio-economic standard, moral values, I would say even happiness, if this has ever been measured. It is the hope. It is the only place in the Middle East where the LGBTQ-community is free to express itself. 
Yet it is condemned by the world and the world does not see the light. How can the world not see this light in this vast area of darkness? I understand how light can blind someone to not be able to see another light, but how can darkness blind someone from seeing the light? 
It is as in the example above. The world is enshrouded by clouds darker than darkness itself. Even the hope that God offers as a light beam is not seen. I understand that the world rejects the light beam offered by Christians, because Christian claim that Jesus Christ is the only Way to God. The world does not want to accept Christians because Jesus Christ judges sin, condemns homosexuality, abortion and other religions and those who follow Him must change their ways. That I understand. 
But why does the world condemn Jews who do not push a religious agenda on the world? The Jews do not evangelize, they have brought so much science and other good things to this world (Christians as well, but it is far less clear when scientists are Christian as opposed to Jews, who often can be recognized by their looks or their (sur)name). 
The Jews are not famed #todo/opzoeken berucht
for their stance on abortion or homosexuality, could it be that the only reason the Western world does not like Jews is because of their "atrocities" against the Palestinians? I doubt it, for when these atrocities happened the press already was biased and reported against Israel.  

*your sons shall come from afar,*
*and your daughters shall be carried on the hip.*

The greatest blessing for our Father is that His children come back to Him. Those who have run away from home to follow other gods, He welcomes home again. And when they come home, they shall join the victory of God. The Jews who have missed out on Jesus' sacrifice are still welcome to join the Father's house and become Christians, or otherwise called Messianic Jews. It is not like the parable of the prodigal son, where he has already spent his part of the inheritance. Yes, the Jews have spent a (big) part of their lives as non-Christians. They have spent even a bigger part of history as such, say 2000 years, they have not joined forces with Christians but rather become the enemies of them. And still, even now some Christians still think the Jews are not worthy to become Christians and do not support Israel. 
But it is not too late, they can still enjoy the presence of God and His Holy Spirit in their lives. 

*5 Then you shall see and be radiant;*
*your heart shall thrill and exult,*
*because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you,*
*the wealth of the nations shall come to you.*

Material wealth is just one symptom. We have seen that God cares for the West in abundance. Even though there are poor people in the West, even in Israel, 
#todo/opzoeken  poverty in Israel
as a whole we're the richest two continents in the world. 
Back in the times of the kings, at least in the beginning, Israel was know for its wealth as well, and not only because of Solomon's gold. The many wars they've won, the enemies they plundered and looted. God gave it all to them as a blessing to kickstart the economy. The economy would continue even in bad times, as traders would come from all over the world and pass Israel from all four wind directions. #todo/opzoeken/engels 
All of this was not the case when Israel was exiled. When part of Israelites lived in Babylon, they must have started from the beginning, not being able to trade anything, because they had no money and most likely were not allowed or able to carry anything on the long road to Babylon from Israel. 
They had to start over from scratch, working with their hands or brains. I have not read about the wealth of the Jews in the Babylonian and Persian empires, but perhaps that was because there was not enough time and especially in times of war, economic circumstances—among which employment—were dire enough for the locals, let alone for foreigners.
In seventy years' time it is difficult to master a language and start a trade. On the other hand, some have managed. The larger part of the first generation Chinese to arrive in the Netherlands in the 70s started without higher education or savings. In fact, a large part of the money they made was sent back to their families in South-East Asia. The second generation, born in the 80s, would start becoming successful in the 2000s, with a relatively high number of university graduates and higher than average middle class incomes. 
But again, this is an already developed country, without war, with freedom of religion, a free market economy and Christian roots. Things were much different in Babylonia and Persia. Over time, however, the Jews have made an impression all over the world through their craftiness—if that is the right word—and niftiness in trade, education and science.
I think verse 5 is not referring to this wealth of individual Jews all over the world. It is referring to the wealth of the country, where Jews—alas, not Israelites, but mostly only Judahites—were returned to Israel—the first instance of Zionism—and the second instance of Zionism after the Second World War. #tags/historic events/wwii#

*6 A multitude of camels shall cover you,*
*the young camels of Midian and Ephah;*
*all those from Sheba shall come.*
*They shall bring gold and frankincense,*
*and shall bring good news, the praises of the Lord.*

Camels were a symbol of wealth. Poor people had a donker, even poorer people had nothing. But a camel was expensive and it could bring you to places far in the desert. Now God is giving them literal camels, but the hidden meaning behind it is that they will get what others desire. 
As a matter of fact, these camels will come *to* Israel, just like in verses 5 and 7 it is the abundance and the flocks that will *go* to Israel. Israel did not do anything. Surely, the people are diligent and intelligent, but this is something that God *gives* them.

The gold and frankincense seems almost like the visit of the magi, who brought these two things as well, only myrrh is lacking and they came from the east. 
Also, it was the baby Jesus Who brought the Good News, it was not brought by the magi.
In this part of the verse, however, it is other peoples that bring the praises of the Lord. What do we make of that? We cannot say it is anything that happened in history, for no other country has ever come to Israel praising God. Nebuchadnezzar has praised God near the end of his life, or at least after his seven-year period of madness, but that did not go together with a #todo/opzoeken  stoet 
of camels and other gifts and these did not come from Midian, Ephah and Sheba. Nebuchadnezzar did not even let them return to their home country, so the question is also how much he praised God and treated the Israelites. Nebuchadnezzar did not praise God in the beginning, but he did say that no one was allowed to speak bad of the God of Israel, after what happened to Daniel's friends in the fiery furnace. A likewise thing happened to Daniel after being thrown in the lion's den by king Darius; Xerxes proclaimed that the Jews could fight for their right to exist and anyone against them. 
Cyrus comes closest to this verse and actually let the Israelites return with gifts, although not the aforementioned gifts and not from the direction stated.

*MacSBNnkjv* explains that the places in verse 6 belonged to the descendants of   Abraham's child through his second wife (except for Sheba). So in other words, Israel's "close" relatives, who were actually enemies, will praise God one day and bring Israel gifts. In verse 7 we see that these places belong to the descendants of Ishmael, in a sense equally close, though the descendants were born through a servant girl, instead of through Abraham's wife. Though equally close, but much more of an enemy in later years when the Muslims would come to existence out of the Ishmaelites. Even they will one day bear gifts from these places. 

Can this be true? Of course. Israel is already doing efforts now to bring water conserving techniques to farmers to Iran. Even though Iran is prohibiting Israelites to enter their country, Israel continues providing them information through the Internet. Maybe one day the Middle-Eastern world will show their gratitude, forget their strife, their ancestral wars and competition for recognition, borne through Mohammed's lack of #todo/opzoeken  juiste woord. 
But it is a beautiful prophecy because it means that—if I interpret this correctly—at least the Muslims in this part of the world will have made peace with Israel before the end of this world. #biblestudy/prophecy
What do we say then of the peoples of Midian, Ephah and Sheba? Those people have gone extinct as far as I know, being blended in with other peoples, most likely during the reign of Sennacherib of Assyria. Have they worshipped and praised our God Most High? 
Maybe it is my knowledge that is lacking, maybe it has not been written down in history or maybe these peoples have blended with Assyrians who later went on to become Babylonians, Persians and who knows what ever more through a diaspora of their own peoples and they have either worshipped God as Christians—though not knowing their were formerly from Midian, Ephah or Sheba—or they will worship in the future, but then as well this will be most likely in the form of Christianity (for Jews do not evangelize or proselytize, again, as far as I know).  

*7 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you;*
*the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you;*
*they shall come up with acceptance on my altar,*
*and I will beautify my beautiful house.*

The word *acceptance* is very important here because without it any gift to God would be falling short. All men are sinful and thus all action flowing from them as well. All the money and gifts we give to God, and all the work we do, is ultimately based on our sin. We do this out of pride—for praise—or guilt, to buy off our conscientiousness, haughtiness—we do it because *we* want to do it. Yet, even though the gift is imperfect, our perfect Father in Heaven accepts our gifts, our prayers, our worship as if it were perfect. He accepts this through His grace. 
#biblestudy/theology/grace

What does *beautify* mean here, when God's house is already perfectly beautiful, by definition? (For God cannot make anything less than perfect, for that would contain something bad. However, God is good and nothing bad can come out of good.) At one point anything that is added to anything perfect will make it only less perfect. 
*MacSBNnkjv* does not specifically address this issue, but he does say that it is possible to give God more glory than is already being given. The glory given to God in synagogues and in churches can be even expanded when people from other nations give Him glory and praise Him as well.

*8 Who are these that fly like a cloud,*
*and like doves to their windows?* 
*9 For the coastlands shall hope for me,*
*the ships of Tarshish first,*
*to bring your children from afar,*
*their silver and gold with them,*
*for the name of the Lord your God,*
*and for the Holy One of Israel,*
*because he has made you beautiful.*

Perhaps the view of white sails of ships sailing over the blue oceans seems like white doves or clouds in the blue sky. 
I still do not know to which event these verses are referring. If it is referring to the future then the children of Israel will probably not come by ships, but by airplanes. Even then verse 8 would be correct, because (white) airplanes too look like clouds and doves. 
However, Tarshish and its ships are referring to marine logistics. #biblestudy/questions

About verse 8: People from the coastlands will worship God because they see how beautiful the Jews are. It is the same thing as Jesus said, that when Christians show His love through themselves, even for their enemies, then others will know we are Jesus' disciples (cf. John 14:35) #todo/opzoeken  and also that we need to shine and be salty. It does not say "so that they may come to Christ" #todo/opzoeken but most likely that is what He means by it.

*10 Foreigners shall build up your walls,*
*and their kings shall minister to you;*
::*for in my wrath I struck you,*::
::*but in my favor I have had mercy on you.*::

To God nothing is impossible and on worldly rewards He can put rewards that are infinitely more rewarding. As for suffering, Jesus has suffered many times more than any person on Earth has ever suffered. 
The ultimate reward is in heaven, to be with God, to feel inner peace like no one on Earth has ever felt before [hier een zijstraatje over hoe de duivel deze vrede gebruikt om mensen die even dood zijn gegaan weer terug te laten gaan naar Aarde om ze daarmee juist depressief te laten worden, vanwege het contrast dat ze voelen. Dit in tegenstelling tot God Die soms mensen terug laat gaan naar Aarde maar die opgewekt terug komen omdat ze nog een opdracht hebben te vervullen en omdat ze weten dat ze uiteindelijk weer terug zullen zijn bij God.], and to be reunited with everyone we know, although we probably will not know them. 
However, a reward here on Earth, higher than usual, is when others serve you. When foreigners, who—in those times at least—usually were your enemies help you to build your walls and that kings—the kings of those foreign nations nonetheless—are ministering to you. 
This is what Israel is trying to do right now in 2019, the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, though not a king, is ministering to Iran. Israel are Iran's foreigners and "enemies" in Iran's eyes—although Israel wants to do good—but the Iran's government is not even letting others minister his own country, most likely out of fear of espionage or intervention in their own (evil) schemes. 
Perhaps that is why God rewards Israel, first of all because He is good, merciful and gracious, but second of all because Israel has done their best to live in peace with their neighbors on their part (cf. Romans 12:18).

#todo/opzoeken wall in Jerusalem, what does it look like? Where was World War Z #tags/movies filmed? 

*11 Your gates shall be open continually;*
*day and night they shall not be shut,*
*that people may bring to you the wealth of the nations,* #biblestudy/promise
*with their kings led in procession.*

Currently the wall between Jerusalem and Bethlehem, #todo/opzoeken  where is it, what is it named? 
is shut continually, only to be opened for designated tourists and visitors, out of fear of terrorist attacks from Palestinians and other Muslims. But then it will be open. Even though—most likely—God is speaking about another gate, the gate of Jerusalem that does not exist anymore, perhaps this verse may be applied to this new wall as well. 
Then the peoples and their kings will come in and bring their wealth (what wealth do they have?)

*12 For the nation and kingdom*
*that will not serve you shall perish;*
*those nations shall be utterly laid waste.*

The logical order here is what makes me ponder about something. Do the nations not serve Israel and *then* perish, or is it that the nations *would* not serve Israel and God foresaw this and made them perish *beforehand*? 
Even though it says "*shall* perish" this does not indicate when the nations will perish. It could be that at the moment of writing it is 700 BC, and later in for example 600 BC many nations perished, such as the aforementioned kingdoms and empires. However, suppose that the moment that is still to come, which Isaiah writes about of the exaltation of Israel, would come in 2050 AD, then still verse 12 is applicable and correct. 
This would provide an answer as to why so many nations have perished. They were not worth living, because they would not serve Israel, *God's nation*. 

*13 The glory of Lebanon shall come to you,*
*the cypress, the plane, and the pine,*
*to beautify the place of my sanctuary,*
*and I will make the place of my feet glorious.*

If this part is about the future, and God cleanses the Old Earth to create the New Earth, would the Lebanon not be destroyed then? And when it has been destroyed, would not all of the Earth be perfect with perfectly beautiful trees? Would there not be trees more beautiful than those of the Lebanon? 
There would be, but perhaps Isaiah is symbolizing the beauty of God's future sanctuary with materials that are currently available and understandable to his readers. That might answer the question of why Isaiah—most likely—uses symbolic ships to indicate freight carriers, though these could mean all kinds of modes of transportation; the whiteness would indicate the beauty of this view as well as its purpose, which is peace indicated by the white sails, instead of black ones. #todo/opzoeken  color of sails indicating purpose? 

*14 The sons of those who afflicted you*
*shall come bending low to you,*
*and all who despised you*
*shall bow down at your feet;*
*they shall call you the City of the Lord,*
*the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.*

The sons of a people have great significance in ancient cultures but in current day non-western cultures as well. If a very bad thing was done against a person, he could say something like: "*Here is my son, do with him whatever you like.*" as a retribution and actual repentance. However, it would not be the same if this person would offer his servant, daughter or even his wife. I am not sure the latter, especially in the case of the patriarchs who so loved their wives they had rather die themselves, but the underlying thought is that the son is worth more than all of these. He is the one carrying the name of the family, inheriting not only the family name, but its wealth and purpose—if any—as well.
So if one person sends someone to come and apologize on behalf of him, it would not be worth much unless it is the person himself or his (eldest) son.
Now in this verse it is both of them, they come, bending and bowing and finally recognizing that Jerusalem is the city of God.

*15 Whereas you have been forsaken and hated,*
*with no one passing through,*

The Jews are facing much hatred in this age, and not only concerning their actions against Palestinians. Even in America where Jewish people have integrated, have become American citizens, where they contribute to society, economy, academia, science, literature and art (there are too many people from Jewish to list all of them here), Jews are still often the target of antisemitic attacks, be it in subtle ways sometimes. There is a reason why the Anti Defamation League exists.  
One antisemitic Islamic person, Ilhan Omar, for example said something about quitting prayers after an attack on a synagogue. It was something not friendly at all, yet no one (from the Democratic Party) mentioned anything about it or rebuked her.
I am not saying the whole party of the Left is antisemitic or has antisemitic slurs 
But when they do occur, they most often do not get reprimanded or retreated in the same way an anti Islamic message would.  

But the Jews will be rewarded. Not for their talents, their contributions to the world, not for their good behavior and response or for following God's Law. No, if it were for those things God could name an immensely number of things they have done wrong which would completely outdo all of the good things. No, it is completely because of God's grace that He promises them this: to be majestic in all eternity.  
How great is this promise and what a contrast with the current situation of the Jews in this age.  

*I will make you majestic forever,*
*a joy from age to age.*

Can you see the contrast between how Israel has been treated and how it will be treated? This contrast is amazing. At the same time it is understandable from a Biblical point of view. The people who belong to God, the Israelite people, are the ones who have been systematically persecuted throughout the ages by all kinds of people, culminating in perhaps the worst persecution ever by Hitler, but the Jewish war of 70 AD killed many as well #todo/opzoeken how many
and *relatively* many more would have been killed in the Persian empire if God had not intervened through Esther and Mordechai (cf. the Book of Esther). 
Now still being children of God, albeit adopted, Christians have been persecuted. My guess is that around the first and second century by the Roman emperor Nero and subsequent emperors this has been the *relative* worst period in history. The number of Christians were probably in the tens of thousands, and almost as many Christians were murdered (once again, my guess, because I do not have any numbers right now #todo/opzoeken ). Compare this to the thousands of Christians being murdered each week in this age, out of perhaps *millions* of Christians (not *billions*, as shown by statistics, because most of those people in that number are not-reborn Catholics, and many of the non-Catholic ones have not been born again either, although it is hard to measure when someone has).
The shocking contrast is that whichever is best for the world, is persecuted. Again, this is logical according to the Biblical world view, because Satan is against everything that is good for this world. So out of all religions, if one is the least likely to be persecuted, it is the Christian religion. Christianity has brought about Western civilization as it is, that is with its wealth, education, welfare, science and high moral standards. It is even aiding the rest of the world through its wealth. Take for example traveling to space, which makes GPS possible, and the Internet, which makes most of the things possible in current day technology, even cars (e.g. Tesla), not only in communications and computers. 
Christianity is the religion that loves people most, helps the world most, brings about most of the peace in this world, and it even aids the most in societal matters. For example, Christians save the Dutch government more than 100 millions euros in costs  yearly for psychological care and other insurance covered care and consequently a better workforce and economy.
What have other religions contributed to this world? Aside from specific persons—Mahatma Gandhi had some wise things to say about peace and was Hindu, but the things he said were not of his religion—I cannot think of any. It would be sarcasm for me to say that yoga has delivered some health to some people, for Hinduism has done much more damage to Christian people that completely outweighs the leniency of the body for those who practice yoga. 
Also, it are these three religions, Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism, who have not aided the world in any significant way, but rather have brought down moral values and hamper scientific research through the poverty they maintain through social policies (e.g. that women are not allowed to work, study or independently make decisions, restriction of freedom through slavery and casts), that attack Christians all over the world. 

Still, the world is not standing up for Christians but rather joining these parties in their attacks. Is that not peculiarly surprising?
Perhaps one might bring up the argument that that is because of Christian's viewpoints on gay marriages, abortions and its support for Israel regardless of its atrocities against Palestinians. There are two counterarguments for that. The first argument is that other religions do not differ that much from the Christian one certain social issues. The second argument is that even without the issues where the political left and right clash, other tribes and nations have always been against the Jews and Christians.
**The first argument: Christian values are not so different from other world views.** The above three world religions oppose homosexuality and gay marriages just as much as the Christian religion. Even if it is not written in the book of Hindu or of the Buddha #todo/opzoeken  hoe heet dat boek? 
, these sins are immersed in the cultures of the nations in which these religions thrive, that is all Islamic, Hindu and Buddhist countries, with or without an official state religion, such as India, Myanmar, Vietnam and more (with the exception of Thailand). This means that both the religious and the non-religious people hold to these values. 
The reality in these countries is that homosexual people and sometimes homophilic #todo/opzoeken/engels persons, that is people with sexual interest for the same sex, but not engaging in sexual intercourse, are being persecuted. The persecution of those countries is much harder than anything in Christian circles. Whereas Christians do not pursue homophilic people, homosexuality is punishable by excommunication and consequently the #todo/opzoeken/engels wegnemen of loslaten van 
their respective ministries. In the countries mentioned above, however, the punishments are in the order of excommunications from society to physical harm and official and unofficial death penalties. 

Without going to other subjects like abortion, sex before (or outside of) marriage and other immoral issues Judeo-Christian values are much more aligned with these three religions than the rest of the world. 

**The second argument: Israelites and Christians have been persecuted throughout all of history.** The argument that claims that Christians and Jews are currently persecuted or oppressed is because of their differing values on moral and social subjects is countered by the fact that even in the absence of those differences there has always been persecution or at least a strong resistance against them. 
In history, for example, when the Palestinians did not even exist, there already was a war against the Jews. We can speak of a few hundred years before and after Jesus, or about the Holocaust, but neither of them were about Palestinian territory. 
The only reason I can think of is jealousy. Israel has at many times in history been a wealthy nation through its naturally and economically strategic position in the world, residing on the cross section of at least two of the world's most important trading routes. On top of that the people had been blessed by God (and still are) with (at the least) intelligence, creativity and health, which serves in the economic wellbeing of the country. (Of course there still was poverty in the country, either due to war or due to an unequal distribution of wealth, by landowners who did not abide by the civil commands given them, e.g. to return land and free slaves after seven and 49 years, to tithe and to take care of the widows, orphans and other poor people. God perhaps made this distribution of talent and wealth unequal so that the wealthy would have an opportunity to give to the poor—there was no lack of that.)
I have read somewhere #todo/opzoeken that other people thought the Israelites were bewitching or cursing the people of surrounding nations with STDs and other illnesses. The fact is that the Israelites had very strict rules concerning hygiene and sexual morality, so that the diseases would not occur or spread. Apart from that I believe in God's supernatural blessing as well, even if that comes in the form of this knowledge. 
So the surrounding nations of Israel were not only jealous of this purity of the Jews, they were also thinking that they were the source of this curse. 
In later times the people of Germany would be jealous of the Jews' wealth, who not only then, but still control the financial world.

*16 You shall suck the milk of nations;*
*you shall nurse at the breast of kings;*
*and you shall know that I, the Lord, am your Savior*
*and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.*

What is milk? It is a natural product containing all of the vitamins, minerals, fats and carbohydrates a human needs, plus extra things to keep one healthy and to a certain extent immune to allergies or boosts resistance.  
It is so important for babies to drink that those who do not or have not for an extended period, will likely suffer from certain allergies and sicknesses later on.  
My cousin has asthma. His son has a few symptoms of asthma, because he was breast fed for approximately half a year. His sister was breast fed for at least a year and does not have asthma.  
My the son of my wife's cousin has severe allergies for a large number of things, such as eggs, shellfish and nuts. After learning about the effects of breast feeding the mother breast fed his little brother and as expected he has little to no allergies. My brother and I myself have a few allergies due to a lack of being breast fed.  

Long story short, milk is the best one has to offer. It is without redundancies. Milk that is #todo/opzoeken/engels aangelengd with water  
is actually deadly for children, because babies can only ingest a maximum amount of liquid per hour.  

The milk from the nations are the best things that the best people of the land have to offer. It is the food that kings eat, the building materials they use. Whatever is available, it is brought forward.  
But note that again there is only one reason for all of this: to give God glory by knowing that this Person speaking to Isaiah, is the mighty God that Jacob spoke of and is their Savior and Redeemer.  
They do not know now, because the generation listening to Isaiah in his time had not been redeemed yet, and only saw or had heard of the miracles surrounding Hezekiah. #todo/opzoeken nog meer wonderen gebeurd in die tijd?  
Even though they were saved from the Assyrians, they had not yet seen God's redeeming work in Babylon and through Cyrus. They most certainly had not seen Jesus Christ yet nor understood what true redemption was.  
But due to the great distance their forefathers had built up due to their many transgressions, this generation did not know God. If a God spoke to them, God even needed to tell them which god was speak t to them.  
Can you imagine the spiritual poverty of those people? It is like people so poor that they only know trash as food and do not know the difference between trash and food and could not recognize it when there was actual food in front of them.

In small steps God will everything better. We do not see growth in technology that fast, even though in the last 30 years we have had more inventions in than in the past 1000 years. In the last 13 years YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, and not to forget the smartphone, have arrived on the scene which have tremendously reshaped society—not always in a good way. Young people these days, however, do not remember how life used to be without this and they are far from appreciating the growth in technology. Moreover, they have become consumers who do not understand even a bit of the underlying technology. Sometimes they do not even understand how to use apps. That is how bad this society has become. 
But regardless of it all, God is making our lives better. Spiritually, He refreshes our soul at any given time. This does not depend on the time we live on. Materially, however, this does depend on the technology of our time and things are better—by *things* meaning material things—given that they are put in the right hands. 
In the wrong hands, such as the NSA perhaps, our lives are controlled through and monitored by social media and all kinds of *Internet of Things* devices. But in the right hands we could actually win wars, such as—as formerly mentioned—Israel is helping out Iranian farmers to preserve water through the Internet—a method that would not have been possible without current technology. 
One day, for Israel—as this book is meant for the Israelites—, but hopefully for Christians as well, *peace* will be the thing that guides us, not guilt, greed and ungodliness. *Righteousness* will be basis on whom we judge and convict people, and it will be executed without fear, restraint or too much mercy caused by so-called humanism. No, real righteousness is based on a holy fear for the Lord and (what is written in) His Word.
No thing shall be done other than our overseers and taskmaster command us, which will be peace and righteousness. 
I am waiting for that day. 

*18 Violence shall no more be heard in your land,*
*devastation or destruction within your borders;*
::*you shall call your walls Salvation,*::
::*and your gates Praise.*::

I truly believe righteousness is the way to peace in our land. If there were righteousness in the Netherlands, our money, that disappears through among others, and perhaps mostly, through social security to people on welfare and illegal immigrants, who are unrighteously using the system, by not working and not finding a job for example, would be preserved and used for those who are actually in need, for education purposes, such as providing better teachers for our children with better prospects and for better health care. 
If only the food industry were righteous, then the cost of health care would drastically decrease. 
These are but two examples, but they would literally turn the Netherlands into the richest country in the world. It would not save them from a spiritual death, but it would save them from many other things. How do we get such a society? By obeying God's Word. Yes, there will be walls incurred. Walls to keep out immigrants, to be righteous, i.e. telling the truth and acting like it. Peace and prosperity always require something from us. It would be like not crossing a wall in order to not confront the enemy who is waiting outside. If you want peace, you have to stay within that wall. 
It is not hard, but humans are fools. They *want* to cross the wall and as soon as they do so, they find themselves in enemy territory, they find themselves fighting with the enemy, fighting with themselves for food and whatever is lacking and then they blame God for creating enemies, creating evil and why He would allow "this" (i.e. this evil, but the question is easily refuted by the fact they the people crossed the wall themselves, and there still is a safe haven, but they refuse to go there).
So the walls of a perfect country and society would be Salvation, through which people are saved and change and actually want obey God's commands, and Praise, because that goes together with salvation.

*19 The sun shall be no more*
*your light by day,*
*nor for brightness shall the moon*
*give you light;*
*but the Lord will be your everlasting light,*
*and your God will be your glory.*

That which has been created is always less than its creator. The sun and the moon as well. We know from the sun that it is far from being the greatest star in the universe and the our moon is far from being as interesting as Jupiter's moons, which has three (or more) moons with much cooler names—such as *Hyperion* after which novels, stories and rock bands have been named, not so much for our moon, whatever its name is—and most probably much more interesting materials on it. 
Aside from this moon and Earth being perfect for us, because God created it—for any "cooler" body would prevent life on Earth—our sun and moon have its side effects as well. In the next verse we read that the sun will go down and the moon is not always visible. This means we do not always have light available whenever we need to navigate or read. We do not always have the heat we need to stay warm.
During the day, on the other hand, the sun might scorch us, almost literally in some places on Earth, while it is not even bright enough or lasting long enough to melt a little bit of ice in the upper northern part of this Earth. And even the sun is not reliable in rising every day, for in some places it appears for half a year and it disappears for another six months. 
No, having God as our light is a much more reliable source. Of course, God's brightness is stronger than the sun's and may kill anyone near or far from it, but He decides who will be affected by it. God's light heals. It is more than just a little bit of vitamin D, which aids in physical processes in our body. Living in God's light, heals the spirit, the mind and the soul. Though His light is not visible for any eye here on Earth, its effects are clear when we see peace in war times, when enemies become friends and when people lay down their lives for their enemies. 
This is not possible without love, which is given to us through God's light. 

Our God will be our glory. That is what verse 19 says. But what have we overcome to deserve this glory? 
One's glory might be his racing horse. It is a horse that has been chosen by you, brought up, fed and trained by you. When it wins, it gives you glory, because it is *your* horse and *your* effort and wisdom has been put into it. 
What gives us the right to say that God is our glory? As for the second part, that is our part on it, that is nihil. We have done literally *nothing* to add to God's power. But it is the first part the compensates for all of it. He has the victory, the whole world sees it and when people ask: "Whose God is this?", God will say: "*I AM the God of the heaven and earth. I am the God of the Israelites.*"
Everyone will be jealous then of the Israelites for having such a good and almighty God, Who gives light at all times, Who refreshes the soul and the body. No other God gives this much glory to its servants than this God. 
No, other gods take away the glory of their servants. Other gods, though all being the facade of the Satan, do nothing but incite lusts in their acolytes and disciples. Surely, Buddhists get a lot of credit for their peaceful gardens, their "harmless" philosophy of *yin and yang*, *feng shui* and other methods that provide a mere physical rest and harmony. But where is the glory? What have they overcome? Have they overcome hatred for their enemies through love? No they have not. I do not know many stories where Buddhists survive the death of a child or another loved one through the love that their god gives them. First of all because they do not have a god, but merely buddhas who are people having found enlightenment themselves. But they are up there, in the *nirvana*, having nothing to do with life on Earth, as far as I know—although in the Chinese version of Buddhism the Buddha, of whom there is only one and who is more like a god than an enlightened person, does help out people in distress. 

Love, by the way, is still the one thing that people want to see in others, which the Satan cannot get rid of. That is why Mahatma Gandhi attracted so many people on both sides of the aisle, both Hindus as well as Christians, because he used love.
Satan tries to attract people with "glory" gained through all kinds of ways. But humans are imbued with a longing for Christ-like characteristics and only recognize glory through these characteristics. So if someone is very righteous, loving, tender, gentle or any of those other things that God is, then this person obtains glory by those who see it. 
But being merely peaceful, rich, beautiful or handsome, or talented does not give the same glory. Granted, it is what people want, but it does not gratify them. True glory does. 
I would go as far as saying that only true glory does. It is for the very same reason that bad guys in movies turn good and (are willing to) sacrifice their life, because all other things, which they already have such as money, power and fame, do not gratify their desires or, for that matter, fulfill their purpose. See for example the movie *National Treasure* or *The Rock*  #tags/movies where Ed Harris turns good. 

*20 Your sun shall no more go down,*
*nor your moon withdraw itself;*
*for the Lord will be your everlasting light,*
*and your days of mourning shall be ended.*

God is speaking of paradise here, or heaven. I am not so sure what the difference between these two words is. But what I am certain of is that in heaven and on the New Earth there will be no pain or mourning. I do not know yet how that is going to happen, because accidents might still occur, but perhaps God is going to control everything. He might shut down gravity locally when He sees someone falling, or He might turn the ground into a soft substance. Or no one will fall due to a full transparency of events so that people will know everything that is going to happen. I do not know, but I do know one thing, God is logical. 
Our mournings will end. Things in the past will be forgotten. They must, because most definitely not all people will go to heaven. Some will go to hell and for those we will mourn here on Earth. But when we go to heaven we cannot remember them and not mourn for them, unless we are without love. 

*21 Your people shall all be righteous;*
*they shall possess the land forever,*
*the branch of my planting, the work of my hands,*
*that I might be glorified.*

In heaven as well can be no sin, for no sinful man can live in the presence of God and stay alive. God will remove all sin from us when we die and go to heaven or to the New Earth. This New Earth will be perfect. Every source of sin will have been wiped out and the main of temptation, that is the Satan, will be locked away—or have been destroyed—never to return again. 
The Israelites shall *all* be righteous. Does this mean that all Jews will be saved? I would say not. Many Jews have died as a secular Jew, not even having faith in Christ. What does *all* refer to then #biblestudy/questions?
Possessing the land is not enough. It is like inheriting a piece of land. It might be worth something when you sell it, but it is worth much more when you use it for planting vegetables or other things. 
The skill itself might be even worth more than that. For what is land worth if you do not have the skill to plant things? God will give us the work of His hands with which we can do magnificent things. Some received the gift of science with which they have created magnificent inventions, others have talents in the field of psychology. And all of this glorifies God. Rather yet, it would be not glorifying Him if we were to have these gifts and not use them. 

*22 The least one shall become a clan,*
*and the smallest one a mighty nation;*

God has always looked out for the smaller ones among us, that is the poor, the weak, the ones who could not protect themselves, such as the orphans and the widows. But still, there are many in this world. Most people in this world fall under this category, around or more than 90%. If God loves these people so much, why does he only on occasion help out people like the widow of Zarephat through people like Elisha?#biblestudy/questions#
The answer is that freedom plays a role as well. People would be cruel to people to use them as slaves with no mercy. NO, that cannot be the correct answer. 
If God kept resurrecting people, would people then be more relentless and kill even more people since those Christians would resurrect anyway? 
Is it to draw attention to even the atheists? If that is the case, would not 50% be enough? 
No, there must be another reason. 
It is to let Christians see, visibly through numbers and reality, how much this world has been polluted by the Satan. If more than 90% of the world is mistreated, it could mean that not only 10% percent of the world is not doing anything or not enough about it, but it could also mean that there is a force strong enough to withstand the people who want to do good from doing anything and keeping the 90% in poverty. 
This could be the 3% of the world that possess more than the other 97%. #todo nog af te maken

Another reason... Rather yet, it is to show more clearly that were Christianity is, there are no people starving to death, there is good education, democracy and all other things of the modern western world. 
In the rest of the world, even where there are Christians, these are either not Christian countries, or they the people are still suffering and recovering from an economic and or spiritual backlash... #todo nog af te maken

*I am the Lord;*
*in its time I will hasten it.*

Either way, God has His own time to heal the nations, the people and especially His people. But He will hasten it as well. He will wait no longer than is needed. 
Thank You, Lord, for coming to s in our time of needs and that you hear and know our pain and frustrations. You will come, on your time, which will not be too late. No, you will even have hastened here. Any sooner would not have been good. Your time is exactly right.
