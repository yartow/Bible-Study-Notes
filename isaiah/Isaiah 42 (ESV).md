# Isaiah 42 (ESV)
**The Servant of the Lord**
*1 “Here is my servant, whom I uphold,*
*my chosen one in whom I delight;*
*I will put my Spirit on him,*
*and he will bring justice to the nations.*
*2 He will not shout or cry out,*
*or raise his voice in the streets.*
*3 A bruised reed he will not break,*
*and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out.* #todo/familytime
*In faithfulness he will bring forth justice;*
*4 he will not falter or be discouraged*
*till he establishes justice on earth.*
*In his teaching the islands will put their hope.”*

This is a prophecy of the coming Messiah and it is fulfilled in the One Person Jesus Christ. Only He has fulfilled all of the prophecies. At the same time he will not break a bruised reed as in verse 3, but He will rule with an iron scepter as in the Psalms. Few rulers are able to fulfill those two criteria. 
I have heard the Cyrus of Persia was like that as well—beloved by the people, perhaps because of his mercy, but a hard ruler in order to control such a big land. But there is more to being the Savior of this world than fulfilling merely these two prophecies. 

Jesus was also gentle, He did not snuff out a smoldering wick. My personal implementation of efficiency is to focus on the method to get the greatest harvest in the time given. But why would Jesus save a smoldering wick, i.e. a person of little worth in a plan, and spend so much time on that? Does Jesus want to use this person for His own plans?
First of all, Jesus does this out of *genuine* love for people and has shown this attribute in the many story about Him healing the lame, the blind and crippled. He probably had a lot of business to do as well, as He was constantly traveling and teaching, but He stopped to talk to a Samaritan woman, a tax collector (Matthew and Zaccheus) and many more "peculiar" people, according to their society. 
This had a lot of effect—a negative effect in the first place, because most people did not want to be associated with those "smoldering wicks". *They are sinful and should not contaminate us who are "clean"*, was probably what they were thinking. 

My contention *was* that one of the reasons Jesus had so much attention for these *little ones* was to increase the impact of His actions, or in other words, disrespectfully said, using them for His own plans—but I was wrong about that. Of course everything Jesus has done and what God is still doing is part of His plan, but this action of taking care of the weak was not meant in the first place to attract people. It was genuine love. 
I *thought* a lot of people would have appreciated Jesus' love in action, but that is simply not true. In those times the people, both Jews (from the north and south) and Romans, did not have such as merciful perspective on the weak nor on the one who was meek, i.e. Jesus. My expectance was that Jesus' actions would touch the hearts of the crowd, but it was the opposite—they looked down on Him for it, seeing a person hanging out with the poor and the sinful. Perhaps it was only the Pharisees who thought like this, but the crowd was easily influenced by them, up to the point where they shouted at the palace of Pontius Pilate to crucify Him.

It is the result, the consequence of His actions that led the poor and needy to love Him more than the ones who did not need Him and the poverty throughout the country was used as a leverage to introduce Christianity because love is the solution and most felt in these kind of dire circumstances.

But a positive effect is that it attracts them at the same time. 
In this society people would run crazy if we were to kill only one person. It would be *outrageous* for us humans to do such a thing, no matter what his worth is in society.

*5 This is what God the Lord says—*
*the Creator of the heavens, who stretches them out,*
*who spreads out the earth with all that springs from it,*
*who gives breath to its people,*
*and life to those who walk on it:*

The Lord stretches out the heavens and spreads out the earth. Is this literally meant as an account for creation or figuratively or poetically, because we see a stretched out sky and planes as far as the eye reaches? I do not know. But that He gives breath to us, humans, and life to all creatures on the Earth, that is not poetically meant. 
Science still cannot explain how life works. Is it really nothing more than matter in motion? There is something upholding it. Just like an engine, which is matter in motion, given a source of energy. But there two noticeable questions about it, three actually. 
The first question is, *who started the engine?* An engine with a filled fuel tank will not start out of itself. 
The second question is that an engine might stop running, due to a clog or something else, when people shift gears at the wrong speed for example. *What happens when the engine stops?* In that case, *someone* needs to restart this. 
The third question is, *who made this engine*—running perfectly on the right ratio of fuel and oxygen and bougies that ignite a spark at the right time when the optimal ratio has been reached? *And who made the fuel* which too must be tuned very finely in order for the engine to run smoothly. Only specific types of fuel may be used in this engine. 

The human body is much more complex than an engine. Even the most complex engines still have the basic principle of ignition and combustion and turning energy into motion. 
To comment on the first question, let us suppose that a strand of DNA evolved in an evolved nucleus of a cell, along with everything needed in order for this cell to work, which means there must be an endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), a minimum of zuur-bases #todo/opzoeken naam van ATCG bases in order to create RNA and then all the other stuff. Let us suppose only those elements are needed that are taught in high school. DNA would have no function without these elements, and these elements would have no function without DNA. 
How did life start? DNA by itself is not life. You would need to have all those specific elements in place and something to kickstart it. For an organism consisting of more than one cell, all cells would need this kickstart at the same time, for cells deteriorate when they are not upheld. 
The second and third question will be answered later. #todo

God is calling us and Jesus as well. Jesus is the first person to have done this and we may follow His lead. Yes, some Gentiles have seen the light, such as Rahab and Ruth, but they did not see the light through a Jew who had a specific calling to spread the light to the Gentiles. In this case, though, from the New Testament on, not coincidentally in Isaiah 42 (where Chapter 40 indicates the start of the New Testament) the Jews are to be part of the covenant for the Gentile people and let not only them but also the figuratively blind Israelites themselves see again, and to let the figuratively captive people—captive by sin that is—be released from their prison of sin, sometimes caused by addictions, pains and bad habits, and also to release those from a figurative darkness, which are people who cannot find the way, which is Jesus, Christianity and God's Law, and without it they have no hope, hence the darkness.
These three things Jews and Christians are meant to do here on Earth. To the Gentiles we must **show** what life really is and what is should look like, we must make them **realize** what they are missing, the knowledge of their sinfulness and the longing for purity, **free** them from whatever is taking them captive and **tell** those who do know God exists.
First note that all "commands" are the work of God. We have a part in it, but it is God Who makes them respectively *see* our lives, *feel* their needs, *be set free* from their hurts, hang-ups and habits and lastly *plant* the seed of the Word in their hearts. 
Secondly, note that there is also an order to all of this. It is through our actions that people come to know us first. People will look at our lives *first* and *then* listen to our words. Actions speak more than words. Another saying is that people do not hear Jesus on an empty stomach #todo/opzoeken  which means we should  *help* people with their practical needs as well. 
::Show Maslow pyramid::
Everyone has practical needs, such as the need for food and shelter. After these have been fulfilled the secondary needs become clear, emotional needs, which are the need for safety, feeling loved and the need to love others as well. Yes, ::the *need* to give to others in our nature::.
How about selfishness? Greed and materialism are indeed withholding us from enjoying what is truly important. Who has not heard about Scrooge (from A *Christmas Carol*) missing out on all the family dinners, just because he did not want to bring a gift? But family was what he really needed.

It is the Lord and the Lord alone who can tell what is going to happen. It is not a prediction to Him but a predestination. He *destined* things to happen in the way He wishes. This honor is to Him alone, only He gets to decide what will happen and only He gets to *tell* what is going to happen. 
He will not give other idols this opportunity to get praise for something that belongs to Himself. Even though idols do not claim they can change the future or have destined it, the fact alone that they know about it puts them in a higher place and gives them awe, like the Oracle of Delphi of Greece and many other idols or mediums in the Eastern and Middle-Eastern countries. 

*9 See, the former things have taken place,*
*and new things I declare;*
*before they spring into being*
*I announce them to you.”*

No, only God gets to announce this to us. How would you feel when you wanted to announce that you have brought a son to life but find out that it has already been announced by someone else—or if you are engaged and someone spreads the news? You would not allow that, would you? This honor and right to tell belongs to you. 
And so do the events of this world belong to God for He alone has decided upon the events, *according to His will*.

**Song of Praise to the Lord**
*10 Sing to the Lord a new song,*
*his praise from the ends of the earth,*
*you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it,*
*you islands, and all who live in them.*

This is a reference to every country, no matter how far. Even those countries who "go down in the sea" and the islands who are in the sea. 
Coincidentally both the Netherlands and Italy are country by the sea. Half of the Netherlands is already under sea level and big parts used to be water but have been drained. Venice is still under water. Furthermore, both Italy as the Netherlands have islands. 

*11 Let the wilderness and its towns raise their voices;*
*let the settlements where Kedar lives rejoice.*
*Let the people of Sela sing for joy;*
*let them shout from the mountaintops.*
*12 Let them give glory to the Lord*
*and proclaim his praise in the islands.*
*13 The Lord will march out like a champion,*
*like a warrior he will stir up his zeal;*
*with a shout he will raise the battle cry*
*and will triumph over his enemies.*

These settlements will rejoice when they hear there is a savior who will march out before them to triumph over *his* enemies. They will rejoice because they think he will defeat *their* enemies, but that is not what he came to do. 
*His* enemies, plural, are those things that defeat the purpose of *his* people, which is the devil in the first place—who seduces the people to sin—but in the second place it is the sin of the people themselves, which they hold on to, which are pride (which contains hypocrisy), the lack of mercy, justice and a relationship with God (cf. Micha 6:8). 
These things are *exactly* the things they have been missing and what they were blind to, in part because it was never showed to them. This generation was not shown mercy for example (although previous generations were in the Old Testament), but Jesus showed them mercy and did not judge them even though He could and had the right to, for example in the case of the adulterous woman. 
He showed them their sins, and opened their eyes to their own hypocrisy, of having committed the same sin and now condemning this woman over hers.
He freed the woman who was captive, not only by this sin, but by the reason why she was sinning, her lust or her longing for love. 
Lastly, He showed there was another way, by simply saying: "Go, and sin no more". Mercy is the first part, indicated by "go", but the command to stay clean—"sin no more"—was said in the second part. If we want to be released from our darkness, we need to know the way out and we need a key. We need to open our eyes first, have light to see in the dark, and a direction to follow. This way of not sinning anymore is the key. 

*14 “For a long time I have kept silent,*
*I have been quiet and held myself back.*
*But now, like a woman in childbirth,*
*I cry out, I gasp and pant.*
*15 I will lay waste the mountains and hills*
*and dry up all their vegetation;*
*I will turn rivers into islands*
*and dry up the pools.*
*16 I will lead the blind by ways they have not known,*
*along unfamiliar paths I will guide them;*
*I will turn the darkness into light before them*
*and make the rough places smooth.*
*These are the things I will do;*
*I will not forsake them.*

A series of contradictory events is going to happen, which I cannot fully comprehend. God is saying this, first of all, and He has kept silent and held back. In the past 400 years, between 400 BC and 0 AD He has not spoken through the prophets or priests, as far as we know. 
"Now", which is at 0 AD, or the birth of Christ is approximately 4 BC, some Bible verses in Isaiah indicate that God is going to save the people. However, why does verse 15 then say that God will lay waste the mountains and dry up their, which is the Jews', vegetation and dry up the water?
Then in verse 16, *leading the blind by ways they have not known*—is that a good or a bad thing? If one leaves the blind there, they cannot find their way back. But if they are guided, they will finally get to places they have not been before. 
The blind most probably could not go to rough places either, for it is hard for a blind person to climb. So God will now smoothen the roads and enlighten the dark they have been walking in. 
Verse 16 seems to be a positive verse, but why do verse 14 and 15 seem so negative? From verse 17 it is clear that God is speaking to a different kind of people, those who worship idols, hence the reprimands there. But I do not understand the relation between verses 14-15 and 16.

*17 But those who trust in idols,*
*who say to images, ‘You are our gods,’*
*will be turned back in utter shame.*

Eventually—we may know—those who trust in idols will be turned back in utter shame. They will be shamed, because their gods could not do anything for them, while they promised the world it would, where they proclaimed this and gathered huge crowds by misleading them with promises they could not fulfill. 
The crowds themselves were misled as well, but should have known better. Even if the information given them was wrong, they should have known not to sin against their neighbors.
The Democrats in the United States are such idol worshippers, who think that their god, which is socialism and freedom by putting away with God, will save them from all problems, such as the (previously) high unemployment rate, poverty, racism and the disparity between white males and all other "intersections"—a term coined in 2017, I believe, by a Yale professor of psychology or sociology. 
Granted, most of the Left are not politically involved, as in committed to reading about the plans, and do not know about the Right' policy and the truths about the origins of the above issues. They also do not know that the dealing with a lot of these issues is making tremendous progress under the Trump administration and by actually *doing away* with socialist ideologies and methodologies—such as affirmative action and food coupons—which only *hamper* the actual solving of the problems. 
They probably do not know whether Fascists are right or left, either, what the difference between a Nazi and Fascist is, or even what Nazi's stand for—they call everyone a Nazi when they have intentions to hurt people, like they are calling Trump, even though he has Jewish family-in-law and done more for the country of Israel than any other president. 
But they *should* know that violence is off-limits. Somewhere in their right mind they should know that abortions are a desperate measure and not a simple and small "thing" to do, like taking an aspirin. 
I cannot even blame the Left fully for confronting the Right with the separation of families, for I assume they do not even know that this is simply the law that the Trump administration is enforcing, a law created by Clinton. 

**Israel Blind and Deaf**
*18 “Hear, you deaf;*
*look, you blind, and see!*
*19 Who is blind but my servant,*
*and deaf like the messenger I send?*
*Who is blind like the one in covenant with me,*
*blind like the servant of the Lord?*

Why is God saying that His servant and the one (singular) in covenant with Him is blind and deaf? Most likely these two are the same person, Jesus Christ, but blindness is a negative attribute. Or could it be that God means something positive with it here? 
In verse 20 the people are the ones who can see and hear, yet they are deemed as disobedient. For if one can see, then he needs to pay attention, and if one can hear, he needs to listen. If one does not do these things, he is disobedient, but the blind and deaf cannot be given any fault. 
However, this would not fit Jesus' description. He came here on Earth with all the feelings a human being can get and still did not seen. It is the former premise of being able to choose that makes Him sinless. The blind do not have a choice to look at what needs to be paid attention to, neither can the deaf choose to listen or not. 

*20 You have seen many things, but you pay no attention;*
*your ears are open, but you do not listen.”*
*21 It pleased the Lord*
*for the sake of his righteousness*
*to make his law great and glorious.*

God did not want to make the people great, but His Law. His Law, with a capital *L* is special. He invented it. It is like nothing else. Even if it is similar to that of other countries or religions, it is still special. God created this Law in the hearts of people, in people of other countries and religions as well. So it is "they" who have received this from God. 
But still, not every law is present in that of other countries. God has moral laws, civil laws, hygienic laws, and most importantly ceremonial laws. 
Why is the latter most important? It is because these laws address the need to serve God. In fact all laws are for God. There are only two directions in which one can serve, horizontally and vertically. Horizontal serving means you are serving those on your own plane, which is Earth. This could be others, ones you do not know, but it contains yourself as well. 
The vertical plane is everything above or beneath you. Vertical serving means that we can serve God, Who is above us, but also things and matter (through materialism), fake gods and idols (the devil which are the himself), gambling and other addictions, and ultimately ourselves as well through pride and selfishness. 
But all laws are in the first place intended for one thing only, the serving of God. By keeping the ceremonial Law we honor God and by keeping the civil Law we honor God by respecting and honoring His people.

*22 But this is a people plundered and looted,*
*all of them trapped in pits*
*or hidden away in prisons.*
*They have become plunder,*
*with no one to rescue them;*
*they have been made loot,*
*with no one to say, “Send them back.”*

Verse 22 is not a verse spoken out of piety. It sounds to me like a regret. They are not blind for then they would not have sinned, they have eyes that can see, but they did not open it and therefor fell and are trapped in pits. They are to be pitied, but not by God—not immediately, at least. 
This verse is an observation of what has happened to the people. It is sort of a warning for those who have not been taken captive yet, as this was written in Isaiah's time and not in Babylon. The people have this knowledge about the future and they can prevent it. They still get the chance to make their choice whether to obey God from now on.

*23 Which of you will listen to this*
*or pay close attention in time to come?*

That is why God asks them who is still willing to listen. 

::*24 Who handed Jacob over to become loot,*::
::*and Israel to the plunderers?*::
::*Was it not the Lord,*::
::*against whom we have sinned?*::
::*For they would not follow his ways;*::
::*they did not obey his law.*:: #biblestudy/memorization/todo 
*25 So he poured out on them his burning anger,*
*the violence of war.*
*It enveloped them in flames, yet they did not understand;*
*it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart.*

They are not to be pitied because it is the Lord Himself Who handed the Israelites over to become loot. When God decides to do something, we should accept it. We should not pity the people God is punishing otherwise we working against His will. 
If He puts people in prison, we should not get them out. If He puts them captive, we should not free them, unless He tells us to.  
Moses was asking God to not kill the Israelites after the people sinned by worshipping the golden calves, not because he felt sorry for them—though he might have, but that was not the main reason—but mainly because he wanted to keep God's honor intact. He did not want the people of the world to think how cruel this God is to take His people out of Egypt only to let them die in the desert. *God* was his primary focus!
So after God said he would not kill all of the Israelites, but only those who still did not want to repent or be on His side after a second chance, Moses did not hesitate to kill these rebels. He did not waste any more time on arguing or negotiating with God. 

This question is often asked, *why does God allow His own creation to go to hell?* The answer in fact, is given above. It is the same answer to the question *"Why does God take up the Israelites out of Egypt and then allow most of them to die out in the desert?"*
This question contains multiple questions. The first question is, "Why does God take up the Israelites out of Egypt?" It is because they were crying for help. They lived in a country where they were immersed in pain, idolatry and a lack of recognition for who they were. The were lower rank citizens, if citizens at all, being merely the Egyptians' slaves.
The second question is "Why does God allow most of them to die out in the desert?" The answer to this question is that God allows them the Israelites to die anywhere. They could have died in Egypt, in the desert or in the Promised Land. The core of this question is why God allows people to die, which is because they sinned. 
God wanted the people to sin *less*, which is why He took them out of Egypt, out of this world of idolatry where almost everything they did was sin, the food they ate, superstition, the things they looked at, the constant temptation around them of sexual rituals during celebrations of the gods of fertility or other pagan rituals. Perhaps they were even forced to join in on these rituals. God was *helping* them to sin less and to suffer less, in some cases to suffer less by sinning less. (For example in the case of STDs which are caused by sin.)

Now why does God create people and let them suffer? They did not ask to be created. 
Indeed, "they" were not even existing. Children too, did not ask to be created, but when someone they are created, they are not willing to die—they want to *live* and to live a *happy* life. In normal situations *everyone* wants to live. 
God wants to give happiness to people, He wants "beings" to enjoy whatever He can give them, which are good things. Our souls were non-existent, which means they did not feel pain or any sadness, but they did not feel happiness either. The people of Israel were in Egypt, they did not die of hunger or thirst, and they even had meat to eat, but outside of Egypt they could die from many dangers in the desert, but enjoy many of the good things of the Promised Land as well. 
God brought the Israelites out of Egypt not so that they would die in the desert, but that they would enjoy everything He had to offer them. He brought you into life not so that you would die here on Earth, having filled your stomach with worldly stuff and miss out on everything that is great, but so that you could experience what heaven is like—first here on Earth, later in heaven itself.
