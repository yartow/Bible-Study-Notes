# Isaiah 62 (ESV) 
**Zion's Coming Salvation**
*1 For Zion's sake I will not keep silent,*
*and for Jerusalem's sake I will not be quiet,*
*until her righteousness goes forth as brightness,*
*and her salvation as a burning torch.*

Do the people from Jerusalem realize what a good God they have? This God, Who is ruler over all the universe, Who watches and sees everything, still keeps His eye on Earth and specifically on the little city of Jerusalem. 
Not only that, but God takes time for them, He writes them a letter through Isaiah and many others. God's actions are for Jerusalem's sake. God will not stop until righteousness has taken place. 
How honored would you be if the God of all creation did that just for you or your city? As a matter of fact God is still doing this. Salvation has occurred through Jesus Christ, but not all have accepted. God says here that He will not keep silent. He will not give up and become quiet, no, He will go on until this salvation is like a burning torch that will inflame everything it comes across—everything that is flammable. 
Right now, I do not see many Jews converting to Christianity. There are Messianic Jews #todo/opzoeken/engels Messias belijdende Joden; stichtingen, foundations?
reaching out to Jews, and some do convert, but still, to me this hardly looks like a burning torch as it happened in the beginning of the first millennium, in the first few centuries after Christ, where thousands of Jews and pagans came to Christ and spread Christianity like wildfire regardless of the persecution by Jews and Romans alike.

*2 The nations shall see your righteousness,*
*and all the kings your glory,*
*and you shall be called by a new name*
*that the mouth of the Lord will give.*

No matter what people think of the Jews, and even though most of them have become secular Jews with some of them very unrighteous such as Bernie Madoff (if he is a Jew) and people who invests heavily without caring about people and their jobs (not only George Soros, but also the likes of Warren Buffet), most are still righteous. We see that in Israel's actions, and if we skip the (secular) Jews outside of Israel it becomes even more clear. I have mentioned examples of these before, but aside from those examples it is also the basis of what we call Judeo-Christian value. The word "Judah" from which the word *Jew* is derived, is in it. 
One day other nations and all Christians—for it is currently not all unfortunately who see this—will see this and the *kings*, that is the leaders of those countries and I hope the representatives in the European Union and the United Nations, will see this as well. 
Jews go by many names, often stereotyping their thriftiness, greed or other things. But then they will be called by a different name, a positive one, given by the Lord. 
Now, their official name is *Israel*, which means *he who fights with God*. I would not consider that a very positive name, but it is also a fact. Israel has been in constant struggle with the Lord going as far back as to Moses' time. Maybe it goes even farther back and maybe, just maybe, the slavery of the Israelites by the Egyptians is consequential to that. We see that everything else in Jewish history was caused by the Israelites' rebellion, e.g. Assyria and Babylon and even World War II #tags/historic events/wwii# (when the Jews did not want to go back to Israel despite being offered their own country in 1939). 
But we have hope that one day Israel will not fight with God anymore, she will be obedient and love Him. Maybe she will be called something like *the good wife* or *the faithful servant*, which is a title worth far more than any country has ever received or been worthy of. 

*3 You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord,*
*and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.*

What entails beauty? When we look at the physical, we would look for perfect proportions of the body and in the face. We would look at the perfection in the skin, structure (of the hair for example) and color, with perfection being subjective, perhaps, by culture—although my contention is that beauty is an objective thing and if subjective, only subject to God's subjectiveness, but his sovereignty would in effect make that objective again. 
But when we look at the inner person, we know from 1 Peter 3 #todo/opzoeken  that real beauty is imperishable, quiet and gentle. It is also obedient to the master, whether that be the spouse in the case of a woman, or God, in both cases. 
In that sense beauty becomes contextual because beauty in the eyes of God would be one who obeys God's commands, while in the eyes of Satan it would be one who obeys him. 
Although there is a clear distinction. Beauty according to God renders a person to want to and actually become more beautiful. Obedience leads to hearing God, which gives the person more hope and peace, which in turn leads to more trust and obedience. One can even say this is the "reward" one gets for obedience. 
In the case of obedience to Satan, when one obeys him, and does all kinds of bad things for him, people will dislike what they are doing. They might get used to it, but some part of them will always say—and know—that what they are doing is wrong. As a matter of fact, as mentioned before, even criminals in their right mind do not treat their own family and friends in this way. Real friendship and love, and provision, for their family still takes place in criminal families, as can be so clearly seen in cultures such as those of the Italian mafia and drug cartels, see for example the movies *The Godfather* and *...* (about the Columbian drug dealer with the biggest cartel ever).
These people become less fond of what they are doing, the more they do it, and if they could, they would, if it they were not addicted to the money and power they had. 
Eventually, one cannot say they are being rewarded by the Satan, for he does nothing for them but lands them into hell and even there they will be tormented, for Satan is nothing but a liar who promises heaven but delivers hell. 

There is an important underlying message #todo/opzoeken lemma
here, which could be used as a counterargument for why this argument of the definition of beauty does not work well for Satan, but does work for God. That lemma is that God created people. 
Because God created people He has wired them according to His will. He has given them freedom in their *decisions*, but not in their *nature*—perhaps nature is not the right word, because the Bible says that man's nature is wicked, but I mean the nature even below that one. The natural "laws of psychology", if you will, make sure that humans are not happy with pain, either physical or emotional, and long for things such as love, care, tenderness, but also power, strength, glory, in short everything God represents, because man has been made into the image of God. 
So in that sense it is only natural or logical—which are the same in this case—when people obtain positive effects from something that triggers their inner being. 

Then why do so many people follow Satan if the reward from God is so much bigger? The answer is that humans may be wired by God but the control is still in the hands of humans themselves. Using an analogy, the hardware may be from God, but the software is man's own. 
Satan then uses those rewards such as fame, sex and money, which our body and soul desire so much—wired by God, although God intended these for other *purposes*—to seduce us and utilizes them for our own selfish purposes, so that we will sin all the more and be removed from God even further. 
Why does man then accept the Satan's rewards rather than God's? Because Satan promises those, and He promises those through the fast track. God, on the opposite, does not promise those and if He did, He would not do it through the fast track—except in the case of Solomon, but we do not know for certain how long and how much effort it took him to gain wisdom and riches.
God always wants people to learn #todo/opzoeken tot zichzelf nemen, 
the Fruit of the Holy Spirit on the way to obtain this reward. He wants people to learn love, joy, peace and patience and more. And there are many more characteristics, such as compassion and perseverance (which could have been part of the Fruit, but perhaps Paul wanted to keep the list concise).
Learning these, just like any other  #todo/opzoeken/engels ambachtelijke skills, takes to time to perfect it. 
The Satan skips all those and promises rewards on the short term. 
Little do people know, however, that these promises are void for most people and they do not know or remember the words of Jesus when He says that the Satan is the father of all lies.

*4 You shall no more be termed Forsaken,*
*and your land shall no more be termed Desolate,*
*but you shall be called My Delight Is in Her,*

Here we get the answer to the question of what Israel's new name will be. It is *My Delight Is in Her*, a beautiful name denoting the same thing I mentioned above, such as her obedience, but emphasizing the "husband", i.e. God, instead of the wife.
If God says of anyone that He delights in this person, then that says enough of the person's behavior. Even when we do not know this person, we know God's will revealed to us through the Bible. We know God delights in obedience and faithfulness (cf. Isaiah 1:19a).
Oh, how I long to be called this name, that God delights in me. The Bible says: "God delights in those who are faithful (The Message)" #todo/opzoeken/bible  
I know for certain I have not been faithful enough; I know for a fact that all humans have not been faithful, but the question is, have they been faithful in God's merciful eyes? Have I been? And if I have been on one occasion, what about the others? Would or could God delight in me for just that one occasion when I had been faithful? 
It is not a good thing to doubt. Doubt is not from the Father, it is from the Satan who sows doubts and lies #todo/opzoeken/bible
God gives peace and understanding (cf. Philippians 4:7 and elsewhere #todo/opzoeken/bible )   and hope. 
I must know that if I continue this way, God will call me a faithful servant. I must continue to strive forward in this battle, this marathon, for the crown is waiting there, meant for me, but it has not been given yet. Only when I hold on until my last breath #todo/opzoeken/engels mijn laatste adem heb uitgeademd 
will I enter His Kingdom. 
I must trust that God is merciful and that He finds delight in me, a sinner. 

#todo/opzoeken people recorded on YouTube, last breath?

*and your land Married;*
*for the Lord delights in you,*
*and your land shall be married.*

The land shall be called *Married* and the land shall *be* married. There is a difference between the land and the people of course. God always wanted the people to follow Him, wherever they were—from the garden of Eden, to the desert(s) where Abraham and Moses were in #todo/opzoeken same desert, same route? 
up to the land of Canaan and in the diaspora all over the world. But God also wanted His people to stay in the land of Israel. I think God did not like it when Naomi's family left Israel for food. One of the reasons was probably because they travelled south to Moab, which had a very pagan culture. As a matter of fact every country in the world was pagan so the Israelites should not go anywhere. 
Right now, in the Middle East, the same situation applies for Israelites. They have been banished from Middle Eastern countries they were in—all the way from Morocco to Ethiopia—back to Israel and I do not think any Israelites would want to go (back) to any Middle Eastern country right now, where there is a big likelihood of being killed, aside from the fact that they are not allowed to by most if not all Middle Eastern country. 
#todo/opzoeken  spelling Middle East, 
#todo/opzoeken  where are Israelites not allowed to enter? Only for Jews or even for Arabs from Israel? How do they know the difference? In the passport? 

But even aside from that, even if all countries surrounding Israel were "less" pagan and "merely" atheistic, agnostic at best, but not anti-theistic, aside from the argument that Jews are inclined to lose their relationship with God outside of Israel—which in and of itself is enough of an argument to stay in Israel—there is another argument. That is that Israelites need to be together to be strong. They need to remember their culture which is rooted in the events of God's acts towards the Israelites, it is their heritage and their history. It is what makes their faith towards God stronger. 
So all reasons mentioned above to let Israel stay in their own land, the land of Canaan, are meant to uphold and strengthen the faith of the Israelites. That is why God wants the Jews to "marry" the land. Currently, there are but a few Jews who live in Israel, the rest lives in the rest of the world, some supporting Israel but most attacking it for its policies against the Palestinians. 
#todo/opzoeken percentage of Jews against or boycotting Israel? 
#todo/opzoeken how many Jews in the world and living in Israel itself? 

This too is part of a prophecy.. #todo nog af te maken

*5 For as a young man marries a young woman,*
*so shall your sons marry you,* #biblestudy/questions
*and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride,*
*so shall your God rejoice over you.*

The land of Israel, not the people, stands in the middle as a bride between her two grooms God and the people of Israel. In both ways a "marriage" could be seen here, between her people and the land, and between God and over the land with the people in it. 
This verse again emphasizes the importance that the people of Israel live in the land that was promised to them. We do not know the reason, maybe we will never know, but one thing we know for sure: they have to live there because that land is the land God promised them. God did not choose another place. There might be places that are more strategically positioned, more fruitful, better climates or with other characteristics that are better, but still God chose this place. 
Actually, I can not even think of a more strategic place than Israel. It is in the middle of Africa, Asia and Europe. The only other places where people from different continents must cross through are Ecuador, which is in the middle between North and South America, but that is far more irrelevant compared to the trade done between the former three continents, especially in those days. 

Today, still, Israel is still like a funnel or bridge, between certain economic, academic areas or trades. Diamonds for example are as I remember always shipped to Israel first, to be graded (or #todo/opzoeken/engels bewerkt) , before they are transported to other places. If it is not Israel, then it is a specific area within Antwerp, of which most workers there are Jewish. 
I have heard on a video of PragerU that nine out of ten big companies have Research and Development facilities in Israel. Technology-wise, as for hydrology and watering in desert areas, most of the world would come to Israel for their technology as well. In the same way the companies and governments come to the Netherlands for #todo/opzoeken/engels baggeren, land opspuiting en polderen 

Another important thing is that God *rejoices* over Israel, here the people are meant, like a a groom over his bride. In Eastern culture a groom did not really know his bride, like Jacob did not know Rachel and even mistook Leah for Rachel, although he was acquainted with her for seven years. The expectations are high, because there have been no fights yet, and contact has been merely superficial. Even now, where people do know each other and even sleep with each other, newly-weds have high expectations of each other and of their ensuing marriage. #church/material
So even though God knows our hearts and our past, He has not adjusted His expectations of us but rejoices over us in the same way a groom does over his bride who is perfect, in his eyes. This of course is in the future, when God has wiped out all of our sins and passed judgment on everything and everyone. 

::*6 On your walls, O Jerusalem,*::
::*I have set watchmen;*::
::*all the day and all the night*::
::*they shall never be silent.*::

This is such an important verse, such a practical and applicable verse. God is saying here that He has set watchmen on the walls of Jerusalem. God has protected Jerusalem all this time. God is speaking here not only of the city, but Israel's heart as well. Even though God has not spoken for 400 years before the time of Jesus, and perhaps there have been less miracles in Israel in these days, because the Jews did not believe in the Messiah and had already seen the sign of Jonah, which should be enough for them, according to Jesus, but these watchmen have never been silent. In other words, God has always warned the Israelites, but I think us as well, against anything from the Satan. The watchmen have not only warned us but also called us to remember the Lord. 

::*You who put the Lord in remembrance,*::
::*take no rest,*::
::*7 and give him no rest*::
::*until he establishes Jerusalem*::
::*and makes it a praise in the earth.*::

Next, God is calling us to never stop remembering Him. Remembrance is not an event that only takes place once a year, such as Easter. Remembering Him must be done regularly, such as during the weekly or monthly breaking of the bread, or actually every time when we sin and realizing that our sin is against Him and hurts Jesus Christ, at the same time realizing that God so loves us that He is willing to forgive us again and again, which He tells about in the Old Testament even before Jesus' incarnation. 

It is good to rest, for some things, but not for certain things. Some things are meant to be received and given, to keep things in balance for example so as not to get bloated with knowledge. Other things, however, are never meant to stop. Things that give life is what I am talking about, for Jesus has come to give life (cf. John 10:10). 
So breathing is one of these things and worshipping God is another thing, the most important thing we can do for God. Remembering God is what we are called to, but it does have an "*until*" here. Should we stop remembering God at some point? Yes, when He has established Jerusalem, on the New Earth, is my guess for I can think of no other way, we will see God all the time. Thus, remembering Him will not be necessary anymore, because He will be right in front of us. 

*8 The Lord has sworn by his right hand*
*and by his mighty arm:*
::*“I will not again give your grain*::
::*to be food for your enemies,*::
::*and foreigners shall not drink your wine*::
::*for which you have labored;*::
*9 but those who garner it shall eat it*
*and praise the Lord,*
*and those who gather it shall drink it*
*in the courts of my sanctuary.”*

The last time Israel's good was given to their enemies, before the Assyrian invasion, was not long ago, but happened during the few invasions or attacks on the cities, both in the north and south of Israel, I suppose, when they lost battles with their surrounding countries. But speaking of Israel as a whole, with *most* of the food given to her enemies, that time occurred in the period of the Judges, when severe famines had to be aroused for the people of Israel to call on God. 
This, however, will not happen anymore, if it is up to God. God is the One Who decides and He sworn, once again, by His right hand and His mighty arm, which are sufficient, for God swears by Himself and always keeps His oath.
Present day Jews might not be able to comfort themselves with this promise yet, for if this is referring to the future, it might mean that this will happen again. They can rest assured though that on the New Earth, it will not happen again. All of their work shall be kept to themselves, it will not be taken by others, but in their freedom they will return it to God, to praise the Lord. 

Once again this is not only a promise of God's blessings for us, but also a promise of what our relationship with God will be like, the first is that we will no longer need to "remember" Him and the second one is that everything we do will be for God. 

*10 Go through, go through the gates;*
*prepare the way for the people;*
*build up, build up the highway;*
*clear it of stones;*
*lift up a signal over the peoples.*

What God is also asking of us is that we clear this way for other people. Actually, God is telling the Jews to do that, but it goes for us as well. Clearing the way is the first thing we need to do, the second thing is to lift up a signal. 
What good is it to clear a way if there are many others ways? People need to *know* that this way is the only way and that it is good and where it leads to. 
So what have the Israelites, the Jews and the Christians been doing? The post-exilitic #todo/opzoeken/engels Israelites had a different position than the Jews in the diaspora as well as present day Jews. The former knew of the book of Isaiah, although relatively it had not existed that long yet. They might have had less understanding of the Bible as well because of living multiple generations abroad in Babylon and Persia. The scholars, the scribes of all "tribes" and schools, such as the Pharisees, should have known what was written in Isaiah, however. This is exactly what Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for, for not clearing the path and for lifting up the wrong signal. 
They path they showed was one leading to moralism, with many rocks on it. This path leads to life, but no one would ever be able to reach the end of the path. Furthermore, the Pharisees themselves did not lift out a finger to help the people to walk that path and instead only added more rocks on this path to make it harder for them. Making the path smaller can be a good way of preventing children from wandering off of the path, in the sense of building a safety margin, but that is not what the Pharisees were doing. They were putting loads on people's back, adding rocks on the road, making the path smaller and #todo/opzoeken/engels extra windy, kronkelig? They did all this to show that the hard work is the way to reach God. They did this, in fact, because to them this was the easier path than the path of following Jesus. 
Why is that so? On this path you have control of reaching the end. You do not have to admit your pride or worship a God higher than you. You have to pray and tithe and fast, but you do not have to do it for God. Just an outer appearance is enough. On the way you will get compliments and praise from people as well. What a small sacrifice this is to reach heaven. 
But Jesus never intended people to walk that way. Also, although the way of righteous deeds exist, the way of the Pharisees was a crooked version of this. Outer appearance would never be on *any* way of God. 
#church/material

Now before we get to the way the Jesus described, what did the Jews do after the Diaspora and Jewish War of 70 AD? I do not know much about the history of the Jews, by I have never heard of active proselytizing by Jews. Sure, every now and then a heathen person may marry a Jew and convert to Judaism, like President Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, has done so with Jared Kushner, but this still remains an absolutely and relatively small amount of people. 
Then what about the promulgation of Judaism, not the religion but it virtues? That too is little known throughout history (again, my knowledge of history is limited) and the beautiful virtues, science and literature Jews have, they have mostly kept to themselves. 
Those who are Christian have spread the Christian message of Jesus as the only Way much better. They have pointed in the right direction, shone the light of its every virtue from science (cf. Pascal and Newton) to art and music (cf. Bach), and especially its moral values. However, within the Christian branch as well crooked paths have been made. Alas, the more orthodox branches, the Reformed and Dutch Reformed and many other branches have put moralism in Christianity while more recent denominations such as those of Joseph Prince and Joel Osteen have made the Christian faith liberal and accessible to all without any cost—meaning by that that grace is free indeed to us, but that it cost Jesus His life, the impact of which is disregarded by the latter two—and its (material) blessings are obtainable to everyone.

None have done a perfect job, the Christian might have done most, but only because Jesus Christ pointed the way for us and we only have to imitate Him. But on the New Earth, all of this will be perfect, Jews and Christians alike. 

*11 Behold, the Lord has proclaimed*
*to the end of the earth:*
*Say to the daughter of Zion,*
*“Behold, your salvation comes;*
*behold, his reward is with him,*
*and his recompense before him.”*

This is what the Lord has proclaimed and He has sworn this, multiple time, in this chapter and in many others like Isaiah 41 #todo/opzoeken? . It will happen. That is all we need to know. 
Jesus will come, *with* His reward and His recompense. Although we do not *deserve* any reward, for what we have done wrong is much worse than we have done right, and Jesus' salvation is more than everything we have done right put together, but He still comes and saves us, out of love, He rewards those who have waited for Him, out of grace, and He recompenses us for our loss, out of mercy. #church/material
At the end of our lives—let alone the end of this world, when we will receive this all the more—we will see that Jesus' salvation is real. We will stand before the throne and as for our destination God will not judge us, but His own Son. So the fact that we will not end up in hell, that alone is what salvation is about. If one is saved from imprisonment or rescued from prostitution, that alone is enough to be called salvation. Of course it is not enough, for both former inmates and prostitutes need to know how to make a living from then on. 
Now when we as Christians are saved, we are not only saved from hell, our final destination, and the shackles of sin, for we will not live under the Law then anymore, but we also receive guidance for living and a gift through the Holy Spirit. That, one could say, is the reward we get—again, not reward because we did something good, but because of God's grace. Our past hurts are healed and most of our questions, or at least the most important ones, are answered. That is our recompense. 

*12 And they shall be called The Holy People,*
*The Redeemed of the Lord;*
*and you shall be called Sought Out,*
*A City Not Forsaken.*

No matter what the people and the land of Israel are, it is not what lives in the minds of people. The people are the Holy People, but they are not treated as such. They are put on a lower position than even Muslims who do many atrocious things in the name of Allah and hardly contribute to society, if they do not diminish it at all. But many, on the Left, are anti-Semitic. They do not treat the Jews as holy. Far from it. 
Then, the Jews are always so the *Redeemed of the Lord*, but this too seems to be far from reality. How many are in fact "of the Lord"? Only the orthodox ones? That is but a small percentage. And what about "Redeemed"? The secular ones still need to be redeemed and of the orthodox: many still live in poor neighborhoods such as the Bronx #todo/opzoeken 
Then what about Israel, the land itself? It is called "...not forsaken" here, but in practice it is far from that. The United Nations has *all but* forsaken, she and almost every country in it, voting against Israel, reprimanding her, fearing and supporting Islamic countries. What is the matter here? Why is there so much hatred towards Israel? What has Israel done to non-Muslim countries that they are so cruel towards them? 
It cannot be rationalized by Israel's deeds against the Palestinians. Many other countries commit likewise and much worse atrocities, dictatorial countries led by a warlord or some other fascist or communistic dictator, such as Zimbabwe, Nigeria or Uganda #todo/opzoeken  commit crimes even now, but the United Nations condemns Israel far more often then them.
