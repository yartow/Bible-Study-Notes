# Isaiah 45 (ESV)
**Cyrus, God's Instrument**
*1 Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus,*
*whose right hand I have grasped,*
*to subdue nations before him*
*and to loose the belts of kings,*
*to open doors before him*
*that gates may not be closed:*

Remember here that it is God Who grasped, or held, the right hand of Cyrus. Aside from the literally meaning this could still mean that God figuratively held Cyrus' *literal* right hand, which means that God guided him, or that God figuratively held Cyrus' *figurative* right hand, meaning that God guided the people highest ranked, beneath Cyrus.
I do not know much about the events taking place in the time of Cyrus. The book of Ezra writes about the good he has done for the Israelites, by not only sending them home, but aiding them with materials for their city gates #todo/opzoeken and the temple as well? 
He also ordered a people #todo/opzoeken I forgot the name
to help in carrying #todo/opzoeken or building as well? 
the same people who used to be the enemy of Israel, now being punished in this way. 

Iran folkore about Cyrus #todo/opzoeken 
Cyrus is even recognized and mentioned by (modern) Iranians as the only king of the Persian empire in which there was peace on the battlefield and in politics, economic welfare and self-governing states. This is a foreshadow of Jesus ultimately, the King of all kings Who ~brings peace~ by slaughtering the devil, our enemy, #todo/opzoeken  die tweestrijd zaait, Engels
who brings politics to an end, by ~*declaring* what is good and what is bad~ —no more debates about that— ~no more diplomacy~, He will say it straight out. 
Perhaps the United States are a foreshadow of God's Kingdom as well and the Persian empire is a foreshadow of the United States as well, where there are self-governing states, where it has always been the *intention* that the government's involvement is minimal (which the Democrats want to do away with, i.e. they want to have a so-called "big government" and increase the power thereof). 
I believe the Republicans are those who stand for a country that resembles the kingdom much more than the Democrats want. The Democrats have some seemingly good points, like socialism, which "looks like" the first churches in Acts, where people willingly shared what they had, but they are forgetting the "willingly" part and force it upon the rich. So it is with many, if not all, of the policies they support. They look good for the people, the multitude, but in the long run they are bad for especially the multitude, bad for the country and good for the select only. 

The three underlined actions above, clearly present in the Christian culture, are what Republicans are trying to inject into the American culture. Unfortunately they *have* to *inject* it, because it is there no longer. Perhaps it was present at some time in the past, but for sure, it should have been present for that has always been the intention. 
This is what, I believe, the United States does. 
* bring peace
* set moral values
* destroy diplomacy (political correctness)
#church/material

**Bringing peace**
[Examples of the Vietnam War, Gulf War, Afghan War, occupation in Iran, etc.]
[All of those examples where the United States had nothing to win (except for some things, like oil), but everything to lose, especially lives
only to bring peace and destroy Communism]

**Setting moral values**
Furthermore the Republicans want to have clear guidelines about "everything", such as
1. If someone has a company and makes a lot of money, whose money is this? 
2. If someone does not have high scores, can he be allowed to a prestigious university? 
3. If someone says something is not right, does it depend on who says says it? 
4. If there is a basic or constitutional right, does that apply to everyone?—the same with laws.
5. Are men born like men, actually men and should they be treated as such and comply to rules for men?
 
For the Republicans the answer is simply "yes" to all of these questions and questions alike; For the Democrats it is not so easy, it is either a "no" or a "it depends". 

It is remarkable to hear that it is Persia who comes to the aid of Israel—all honor to God, of course. An empire who invades your country and kills your people, and then—even by another king—decides to give back your country, send back your people, and even "pays" for some of it, while they were the ones to destroy the city gates and the temple in the first place and steal the treasury from the nation's chest, can hardly be seen as a gracious king. I think that that is the reason why God let *Babylon* invade the country and let *Persia* redeem it.
Note, however, that it is not certain how bad the lives were of the Jews in Babylon. Yes, people must have been killed and their materials were taken from them, but God put many of the Jews, at least four (Daniel and his three friends), at high positions in the empire. Daniel even stayed in this position in the next (Persian) empire. At least a third of the land was governed by Daniel and the Bible makes it clear that from approximately the beginning, after Daniel's friends were thrown in the fire #todo/opzoeken  exact name, fire pit? 
king Nebuchadnezzar allowed no one to mock the God of Israel.
The lives of many Jews were at least good enough for them to decide to stay in Persia, even after they were released. Two of them being Esther and Mordechai, and in the book of Esther many other Jews, #todo/opzoeken in alle uithoeken (outskirts?) van het rijk, Engels
are mentioned as well, still living in the Persian country. 

**destroy diplomacy**
Political correctness, not just the wording but the actions that flow from it, are destroying the land. 

We have not even discussed the meaning of the right hand of Cyrus yet, but for certain God used Cyrus. Whoever his right hand was, I do not know, but if Cyrus had acted, he most surely would have used his aid, his so-called right hand, to execute his orders. 
This is part of a chain reaction. If someone at the top orders something, his servants will tell their servants to do it, continuing for many levels. But depending on how much you are willing to listen to your master—and this goes for every level—you will either ask your best man to do this or some other guy. 
This might be a bit of reading into the text, but if Cyrus' right hand were actually used, it means that he was willing to give in to God's orders—even though he did not know God before, as mentioned in verse 4. There still is the possibility that he knew God afterwards, especially if he had a good relationship with Ezra. 
#todo/opzoeken Look up Cyrus in Wikipedia. 

*2 “I will go before you*
*and level the exalted places,*
*I will break in pieces the doors of bronze*
*and cut through the bars of iron,*

When God leads someone, He will also provide a way. He will go *before* us. He is not like leader who have never done something before and want their #todo/opzoeken  opposite of superiors, onderdanen, to see what it there. No, He will join the fight and even fight *for* us. We could never break doors of bronze or bars of iron, all we have to do are the easier things behind those doors—things God could have done Himself, but He wants us to join the fight, so that we can experience some of it as well.

*3 I will give you the treasures of darkness*
*and the hoards in secret places,*
*that you may know that it is I, the Lord,*
*the God of Israel, who call you by your name.*

God even went as far in proving to Cyrus that He is the Lord, the God of Israel. Of course, it is better that Cyrus knows that it is God Who gave him all of these treasures and victories than that he would attribute all of this to some idol. 
But God did not need to give him all of these treasures, He could have proven Himself in other ways. Breaking those doors alone was proof enough. Being able to conquer an empire strong enough to conquer the Assyrian empire, although the latter was not at its strongest point when it was conquered, proves that miracles were in place. 
Of course all of the strategies could be explained like many of the strategies of the Second World War are explained on Quora, by historians and others. But all of these strategies involve luck and coincidence as well, which do not exist in a world where everything is controlled by God. And in WWII there have been many occasions like these where luck was much needed. 
We know, however, that none of that was luck, but it was God's hand that led these events to fulfill His plan.

*4 For the sake of my servant Jacob,*
*and Israel my chosen,*
~*I call you by your name,*~
~*I name you, though you do not know me.*~
~*5 I am the Lord, and there is no other,*~
*besides me there is no God;*
*I equip you, though you do not know me,*
*6 that people may know, from the rising of the sun*
*and from the west, that there is none besides me;*
*I am the Lord, and there is no other.*

Why did God do all these things, all of the above things, and why did God provide such as good ruler for Persia? It is for the sake of Jacob. The people of Persia were blessed because of the presence of Jews in their country, because with it the God of the Jews was with them as well. Those who take good care of God's people will see God's blessings. Even those who did not take good care of the Jews, such as the Egyptians, were blessed with their presence—for their hard labor, although they could have obtained much more from them, such as wisdom and knowledge. 
A few years ago many North-African countries and countries in the Middle-East banished all Jews from their country. As a consequence of that the economy dropped and the level of education as well. 
For the sake of Israel God will do many things. Cyrus perhaps has never read this part, even though he could have, because it was written only a hundred years before his birth, but God was working through him—He even equipped him! 
All of the things Cyrus needed to be a servant of God were given to him by God for one reason only: that *all* people may know, there is *only one* God. 

*7 I form light and create darkness;*
*I make well-being and create calamity;*
*I am the Lord, who does all these things.*

I have a theory that darkness is not created by God, but that is has always existed. It is God Who created light and with it shadows come into existence. Shadows as a matter of fact or not matter, they cannot be created. Light is matter or a wave, but it is not void, it is something and it is created. Shadows are merely the absence of that. 
Does this theory apply for good and bad as well? God is good and He brought good into this world. Now both good and bad are not matter nor waves, so it is more difficult to talk about this, but good is something that has always existed, because it is a property of God. Has bad then always existed as well? 
In theory, yes. Even if no one does anything bad, the concept of bad exists, which is the opposite of good. Adam, for example, *could* do bad, he knew what it was and how to do it. Bad "things" did not exist yet, *trespass* did not exist yet, cigarettes, to name but an example, did not exist yet. But the concept of "bad" has always been present. 
So in practice, the answer is "no". 
Could it be that my theory is not correct? Why does this verse say that God created darkness and calamity and that God *does* all these things? 
I can think of an answer how and why God creates calamity. God's plan includes some calamities to let (His) people come to Him. God simply orchestrates things in such a way that people will create the right calamities at the right time. I think that even without the interference of God, the people would have caused this calamity on them, like how the Israelites (Judahites to be exact) would have gotten conquered by the Assyrians—God allowed the Israelites in the north to be conquered and He sent His angel of death, be it through the plague or #todo/opzoeken  pokken, bubonic plague?, wat was het volgens Josephus? 
to prevent this calamity. But He never incites people to kill others. 
This answer does not satisfy completely, but then again, I will never fully understand God. God is good, He never does anything bad. We can also say that creating darkness and calamities are not by definition bad things—or the other way around, because God does it, it is not bad. The latter does not imply that when we do such a thing, it makes it good, but it is God Who causes a calamity for a specific purpose with a specific outcome and a specific number of casualties—all of which involve no risk at all, having a probability of 1 of happening exactly the way God wants it. This, though all in theory, would allow God to do such a thing while still be confined by the limits of being and doing "good". 

*8 “Shower, O heavens, from above,*
*and let the clouds rain down righteousness;*
*let the earth open, that salvation and righteousness may bear fruit;*
*let the earth cause them both to sprout;*
*I the Lord have created it.*

Not only is rain refreshing and restoring life with its water, but righteousness comes along with it as well. This may have been written in a poetic way but through rain salvation and righteousness bear fruit. 
Now a salvation means that many people are salvaged, brought back that is, from a situation where they could not thrive or would be destroyed. Many of the Jews were salvaged, so to speak, from Persia and brought back to Israel. But how much fruit was there actually? Had the Jews really changed? Did they really love God? Did they really love their neighbor, more than they did before they were taken captive to Babylon? 
There was not much fruit actually. I do not know if it was any better, but poverty still existed in Jesus' time. No one took care of the poor and the lame, the sick and the imprisoned or for widows and the elderly—not as many people as there should have, at least. Jesus had to come and do that, as mentioned in Isaiah 46 #todo/opzoeken  exact verse. The only thing I can grant them is that they did not worship idols anymore, although I would say they traded one idol for another, namely themselves by observing the Law. 
But if righteousness were to rain down from *heaven*, then the salvation on *Earth* and the righteousness on *Earth* would sprout. The reason of this lack of fruit mentioned above, is because of a lack of righteousness—people do not care for the righteousness of the poor and needy. But if this Earthly righteousness is present then the reason for which the Jews have been salvaged will be clear as well, their salvation (from Persia) must lead to more salvation (from sin) and ultimately even to salvation from (physical and spiritual) death. That is what it means to bear fruit. Salvation must lead to more salvation and righteousness must lead to more righteousness. But to make Earthly righteousness sprout, first there must be heavenly righteousness, which has come from the only place where it could come from, God. 
That righteousness is with God indeed, but it has come to us through one way only, His Son Jesus Christ, Who *credited* His righteousness unto us—that is, in advance, like a credit card—even while we were sinners, while we did not deserve it yet, by paying for it *in advance*. We never paid Him back and we never will be able to, but the good news is, we do not have to! 
 #church/material

*9 “Woe to him who strives with him who formed him,*
*a pot among earthen pots!*
*Does the clay say to him who forms it, ‘What are you making?’*
*or ‘Your work has no handles’?*
*10 Woe to him who says to a father, ‘What are you begetting?’*
*or to a woman, ‘With what are you in labor?’”*

This example is one of utter disrespect against the Maker. It shows how big the distance is between the maker and that what is being made. The pot does not live. So it would need at least one step—a big step—to come alive. It also has no mouth, that is another step; even if it had one, like an animal, it did not have the ability to talk, that is the third step. Even if it had, it does not have that ability yet, like a foetus in the womb—the fourth step. 
Only then come the hierarchical arguments. What right does the pot have to inquire its maker of what he is going to make? This question—most probably as stated in Hebrew—is not stated in a neutral inquiring way, but more in a demanding way, telling the maker what to do. But if we first consider a neutral inquiry then the question becomes: does the maker have to answer him? The answer is *no*. He does *not* owe him any answer or explanation. He is the maker and he has all the rights to do with his creation what he wants—step five, that is. 
It follows from this that the maker most definitely does not have to listen to any suggestions or corrections from its creation. 
A sidetrack, but since the next verse is about a human foetus asking this we can also ask ourselves the question whether a human being has the right to do with his child as he wants? That answer is a clear *no*, although not for very obvious reasons. There is a clear distinction between the creating of God and our "creating" of another human being. God creates from "scratch", and I have put *scratch* between quotes because He is literally building from even less than that. He is building from nothing, not even from protons or leptons. He created everything from nothing and even the figure of speech "from the ground up" would not apply here, because there was no ground to build on. What man does is merely an act, and not even a difficult one. It is not even through perseverance or hard work that he achieves this, no design comes into place and almost no thresholds. It is in his instinct to do this, motivated by hormones. It is rather counter-intuitive not to do this, which concerns what the Bible is trying to teach us—sometimes chastity, but at least before marriage and to keep sex inside marriage. 
That is the first distinction we need to make. Man can hardly be seen as a creator because he lacks all of the aspects of a creator. He is merely a person who pushes on one, and the last, button of a machine, while all the ingredients and even the surrounding elements are already present and configurations have already been set.
The second distinctions is a more difficult one. It involves the rights that God has given to every human being. These rights arise due to the (intrinsic) value that God has put into man. It is not a value established by market value, because there was no market before the creation of man. It is valuable simply because God made it valuable—because God made man in His image. God's is worth an endless amount, an image of it is worth at least a fraction of that.
These are natural rights which protect man's life so that man may not be killed for no reason, and why their creativity and words are protected. A child needs to be treated with respect for this very reason, hence the parent cannot do anything he wants with his child. 

*11 Thus says the Lord,*
*the Holy One of Israel, and the one who formed him:*
*“Ask me of things to come;*
*will you command me concerning my children and the work of my hands?*

As I interpret this verse, it means that we can ask God about the things to come. We can *ask*, but we cannot command Him about anything that has to do with His children—both Israelites and his adopted children, Christians—or His creation. As a matter of fact, we cannot command Him about anything at all! In any case, at least these two things are mentioned, perhaps because this is what humans understand best as well if anyone interferes with their children and their work or creation.
Two lessons can be drawn from this. 

**First Lesson.** The first point we can learn from it has to do with Israel and Creation. These are two points over which there is much dispute in the Christian world. Christians are divided over these two subjects as to what is the truth. Except for those in the middle, some say that Israel is no longer the land of the Jews and the "horrible" deeds they did to the Palestinians cannot be accepted, and therefore Israel must be boycotted. The other party says that Israel has always been and will always be the land of the Israelites and the Jews. It was their right to take it back. As for the topic of Creation in general it is the same discussion, Christians either believe in evolution or creation.
However, these issues are not even the biggest issues and quite often a congregation's belief in those two topics is not even mentioned in its statutes. I dare to say that these need to be not only in the statutes of *every* congregation, but must be taught regularly as well *as part of the Christian life*! I do not know if Watchman Nee has taught this in his book *The Normal Christian Life*, but if he has not, he should have. 
God wrote in *His* book, with *His* words, that the world is *His*creation and the land of Israel was set apart by *Him* for *His* children. There is no room for debate here. We are not to command God and tell Him that He should have done it differently, we are not to question or correct Him (cf. verse 10) and especially not about these two subjects (cf. verse 11). 
But that is exactly what we are doing! Many Christians are doubting whether God spoke the truth when He talked about the creation of this world and said that His covenant with the people of Israel, for the land of Israel, was an everlasting covenant. #todo/opzoeken 

**Second Lesson.** The second lesson is to see how this is mirrored in our society, starting first in Communist countries, but increasingly gaining popularity in Europe and America, seeping in our culture under the new guise of Democratic Socialism—and people are even falling for it, forgetting the lessons from the past. 
Socialism (and Communism as well) is about *big government*, where the government has control over our children and our produce—exactly the two things God is talking about! In a socialist country—and this is what the Democrats wants—the government decides on the educational program for children (including the teaching of the *theory* of evolution) and how much money one gets. If a person makes more money, the government can take more money from this person. A person can build a company, but—as president Obama said—*you did not build his company, it is the people who did*, and so they imply that the people can take it back, through (extra) federal and state taxes such as in the San Francisco, where big companies like Amazon and Starbucks need to pay an additional tax per employee, just because they make a lot of money. 
Eventually—though implicitly—the government is telling us what is wrong and what is right. If the government does not allow for home school programs and the teaching of creation, as is happening in the Netherlands already, and if it keeps supporting abortion clinics and public health through certain insurance policies, people will learn that life is not something holy and valuable—human lives are worthless and we may decide to end is (abortion and euthanasia) and death is used to get a better selection (evolution).

*12 I made the earth*
*and created man on it;*
*it was my hands that stretched out the heavens,*
*and I commanded all their host.*

No matter what man thinks, God says that it is *His* Earth and *His* creation. He even made the place where Earth is residing in, outer space so to say, and He makes it inhabitable through the atmosphere. So even if the Left comes up with some philosophy (sophistical it would be, however) where God needs to give up His Earth to the people then God can still just simply retreat His heavens, i.e. the atmosphere and space, their host, i.e. all the stars and make the Earth uninhabitable again. 
No, those rules do not apply to God. What He makes cannot be taken from Him. As a matter of fact, *Who* could take it from Him? Everyone, including the angels and the demons, were created by Him, so there is none to take it from Him and none who dare to even claim the right to it—even the devil only dwells where he is allowed to dwell on Earth and his demons only destroy and invade where God removes His hand from. 
Only mankind is arrogant and stupid and proud enough to defy God, to think they can change history by claiming that the world was not created by God, but by nature and the natural laws of physics and this way doing away with God's ownership of the universe and mankind. They do not want someone to rule their lives, so they come up with this strategy and they think that as long as everyone in the world believes it, then it is true. Or then they have a "democracy" against which God cannot do anything. 
They are forgetting that God is a theocrat and that He doesn't work this way. They are forgetting that even the natural laws of physics were created by Him and these reside inside the particles of which everything exists. 
The people of this world, most of them, are using the same strategies to get rid of God's people in the Promised Land of Israel. They are changing what is written in history by disclaiming the Bible and rejecting its authority. They think truth is a democracy, when a majority is against Israel, or the majority of the United Nations is against it, then it is okay to establish embargoes against Israel or to claim land from them to give to the Palestinians. But democracy, no matter how many people, does not change the fact that Israel belongs to the Jews, for thousands for years and before that to a multitude of tribes, such as the Philistines, Gibeonites, Hittites, Perruzites, #todo/opzoeken  and in part, perhaps, the Moabites as well. 

*13 I have stirred him up in righteousness,*
*and I will make all his ways level;*
*he shall build my city*
*and set my exiles free,*
*not for price or reward,”*
*says the Lord of hosts.*

I am not exactly sure of the meaning of "stirring up in righteousness". Could it mean that in an environment of righteousness, God stirred something up, like one stirs up a massive part in a drink by stirring it? Which environment would that then be? Was the environment he lived in so righteous that Cyrus got the chance to become God's servant?
Or is God speaking of His own righteousness and *in* His own righteousness He stirs up a person, just like one does something *out of hatred*? If so, then I am wondering why the #todo/opzoeken  voorzetsel "in" is used rather than "out of". 
Also, I am wondering why God does this out of righteousness, for if the Jews were to be judged in a righteous way, then would the Jews not be suffering for at least a few hundred years more, instead of only these 70 years of exile of Judah? That is what I assume given that the Israelites sinned for nearly half a millennium after David's kingship. 
But perhaps I am wrong about this righteousness. Perhaps the Jews had suffered enough already. In any case, it is certain that God is righteous and has given the Jews what they deserve, but He is merciful as well, so even if righteousness had not taken place fully, that is if the Jews had not suffered enough, through *mercy* God is still able to save the Jews. what about the due righteousness? Someone needs to pay for that. That someone—although He does not *need* to—is Jesus Christ.

**The Lord, the Only Savior**
*14 Thus says the Lord:*
*“The wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush,*
*and the Sabeans, men of stature,*
*shall come over to you and be yours;*
*they shall follow you;*
*they shall come over in chains and bow down to you.*
*They will plead with you, saying:*
*‘Surely God is in you, and there is no other,*
*no god besides him.’”*

God blesses the nations in many ways when they respect and fear God, quite often with wealth and peace, but it is much more than that. Inner peace is one thing—which one can have in his own heart—but outer peace, not peace with neighboring countries but with one's relations and fellowmen, that is something that cannot be obtained with wealth. As a matter of fact, it is most probably rich people who have most of the problems with their fellowmen and family, partially due to the fact that everyone is after their money. 
But even in society there is no peace. Do you trust the school you are sending your kids to? Do you trust what they are teaching them? Do you trust the food farmers are planting for you? Do you think the soil and the pesticides are healthy for the food, the livestock and ultimately for you? Do you trust the medicine that doctors are prescribing to you? Do you trust the pharmaceutical companies that make these products, or do you think they are adding stuff in it that makes you addictive or dependent on their products? 
I think the answers to all of these questions and questions alike is no. Those who do trust them probably have some peace of mind, like those who go to fast food chains regularly without their conscience speaking to them. But those either have no knowledge of the food they are eating or they are blind to it, sometimes by their own choice, willingly choosing to neglect their sin because they want to enjoy themselves, so God gave them over to their own choice. 
This same sin has been mentioned in #todo/opzoeken  Corinthians? where it has to do with the sexual sin. Where most people know what is good or bad, for example it is not right to have sex before marriage, with someone of the same sex or with anything other than a grown and consenting human, but if people still lust after it, God gives them over to it so that they do not want anything else. They do not even want a woman anymore, but only men. Some do not want grown women anymore, but only children. For some, though less often encountered, only animals will suffice. 

*15 Truly, you are a God who hides himself,*
*O God of Israel, the Savior.*

What would it mean for God to hide Himself? #biblestudy/questions
Would He not want people to see Him? No, it is because He is too mighty to show Himself. If anyone or anything gets near Him, it will be destroyed. Anything that is not pure or sinless will be destroyed and everything living will die, because it cannot stand the wrath and holiness of God. So that is why He is hiding Himself. 
That is why He can only show Himself in ways unthinkable. By speaking through angels, by incarnating as a human being onto Earth, by dreams and other messages, through numbers in nature and nature itself. 
How did speak with Moses then and God write the Ten Commandments with His own finger? I do not know, He must have some way to allow some people at some times to see some parts of Him. 

*16 All of them are put to shame and confounded;*
*the makers of idols go in confusion together.*
*17 But Israel is saved by the Lord*
*with everlasting salvation;*
*you shall not be put to shame or confounded*
*to all eternity.*
*18 For thus says the Lord,*
*who created the heavens*
*(he is God!),*
*who formed the earth and made it*
*(he established it;*
*he did not create it empty,*
*he formed it to be inhabited!):*
*“I am the Lord, and there is no other.*

Would a man create a football or soccer team to have it lose and be ashamed? And when this team keeps losing and keeps being shamed, will he stay the coach of this team? Of course not. He will give up or he will do his best. The same it is with God. He created a winning team with the best soldiers in the world. I am pretty certain that the famous soldiers of David's army could even have defeated the best warriors of Sparta (Greece), Mongol warriors and with or without strategy defeated Chinese or Alexandrian tactics. Needless to say that all of this would only have been possible with God's strength.
But they became a losing team because they did not obey their coach, Who was also their leader. 
God let them lose on purpose because this team does not deserve to win. A team that does not respect or depend on its leader, is not willing to work for success and obey the rules. God left them to play by theirselves and through their own tactics, like Hezekiah partially did, but mostly his predecessor(s), by making agreements with Egypt and Assyria, thinking they could escape Assyria's wrath in this way, but losing all of their fortunes eventually most of their land. 
So God could do two things, He could give up on his team or He could do His best. He never gave up on them, in the sense that He would never allow all of them to be killed. He did give up on them in the sense that He did not hope that they would ever change their hearts, because He already knew that not only they, but the whole of mankind is depraved. 
God had a covenant—which He did not *have* to make, but still did, because of Abraham's loyalty to God and faith in Him, and not only because of that, but also because God wanted to Himself—and He kept by His word to always be the God of the Israelites. 
That is why He changed the losing team back into a winning team. Though having led more than several heavy losses, losing the temple, the lives of their family members, leaving behind a lot of friends and family in foreign countries, because they did not want to return to Israel, and perhaps losing their hope as well when they saw the state of the temple and the city walls—they could still win. With God nothing is impossible! 
They got a break, a handicap, a time-out, to return to their country and rebuild it and then regain the match—this time not depending on idols or their own strength, but on God. 
However, when God sent His star player, the One Who would really save them—not only saving the match, but He would make every player become better—his team rejected Him, because in order to become better they needed to change. They needed to train harder, yes, that part they could accept, but the new Guy taught them as well that they needed to put their lives in the hands of their Leader, all of it. 
"This is not a solo game, it is not about you," the Star Player said, "you are doing it for Him, for His plan to work out. You will have to lay down your game, your honor, your strategy and plans and obey the leader in everything. Only then, by giving up yourself you can save yourself." #stories/bible #church/material

*19 I did not speak in secret,*
*in a land of darkness;*
*I did not say to the offspring of Jacob,*
*Seek me in vain.’* #todo/opzoeken waarom apostrof hier?
*I the Lord speak the truth;*
*I declare what is right.*

**Three basic differences between God and other gods.** Our God is different from other gods, so much different in just the basic things such as hearing from Him and knowing what is right. 
When people hear from God it is clear what God wants from them. It is usually clouded by our own judgement and desires so that we think or expect God might mean something else or that we misunderstood Him, but almost always God is clear in His words as long as we are ready to obey and listening carefully without distracting sounds in our hearts.
He does not speak in secret, like the devil disguised as Gabriel has done so to Mohammed. God did speak to Samuel when no one else could hear it, and to Paul and Moses, as well as to Abraham and even Jesus, but they did not have to run hundreds of miles away, they could return to the people and immediately spread the message. They did not come back, shocked and unable to speak—even Paul who was shocked, though by his own misdeeds and the fact that Jesus is God—but they came back with peace in their hearts and confidence in God, having heard from the Most High God, even when it concerned a severe message, warning or punishment for the people.
So God is *clear* and He does not speak in *secret* places, and He can also be *sought*. The latter does not implicate we can find Him anytime we want, but we can talk to Him anytime and anywhere and He will hear us. If we seek Him it will never be for nothing. It will not be like with Buddhist or Hindu gods where one is never sure if he will ever hear anything back or receive anything from their "gods". And when one receives anything from God it is for certain that it is good and righteous, because that is what He is. It may not feel this way, but in the end you will find out that God is always right. 
**God declares what is right.** So what is the difference between our God and those of others? In both cases *if* we receive something from them—although in our case we receive His answer (either through miracles or through His Word) much more often—we may not feel good about it. One god might say that you need to give up your job, which you very like, and another god says you have to sacrifice your child, whom you love very much. Even if both sacrifices are equally big, morally one feels that sacrificing a human being is much bigger than sacrificing a job. It is exactly these *morals* that define the difference between God and other gods and that proves that God is the real god, and the *only* one Who created us. 
He created us with morals. Would not a god who creates a being, create it with some liking for the creator itself? If I were to create little puppets, I would create them to love and adore me as a god, and to love what I love as well. That in fact is how I am raising my own child, to love comic books, movies, technology and facts. My wife is raising him to love people, express emotions and be educated in the things she finds important such as social and civil behavior.
So where do our morals come from? One thing is for sure, they do *not* come from evolution. Moral values have *no* use in evolution and evolution could not have come to moral values through natural selection. Moral values are exactly the opposite of the survival of the fittest, it is to let live and do what is right, even if it kills you. And if you are dead, you are out of the gene pool, so evolution would have gotten rid of those moral persons. 

*20 “Assemble yourselves and come;*
*draw near together,*
*you survivors of the nations!*
*They have no knowledge*
*who carry about their wooden idols,*
*and keep on praying to a god*
*that cannot save.*

I am not sure what survivors of the nations mean here. It is not survivors of the war and Israel is only one nation. I do think, however, that this verse is meant for the Israelites and if Israel is considered as two nations those still alive, whether in Israel or elsewhere, they are considered survivors. 
Then comes the question who "they" is referring to. It is for certain the pagans who live both in Israel and in Babylon and Persia, but it might be referring to the Israelites as well who might have taken over these customs. 
My interpretation is this. All Israelites, let us come together, at least those who have refrained from praying to wooden statues. Let us be different from them. 
(And in the next verse:) Let us stand together against the rest and have a counsel, a match, to prove who is the real god. We will take our gods to the test and see who has predicted what is happening in our countries right now. The answer is already clear, it is the Lord YHWH, our God. No other god has ever predicted this, no other comes even close.

*21 Declare and present your case;*
*let them take counsel together!*
*Who told this long ago?*
*Who declared it of old?*
*Was it not I, the Lord?*
*And there is no other god besides me,*
*a righteous God and a Savior;*
*there is none besides me.*

What strikes me is that God says there is no other god *besides* Him. So even if other gods did exist, they would not be besides Him. As a matter of fact, there is *none* besides him. No one is next to (or behind or in front of) Him, that is on His (horizontal) level. No one is above Him either, so everyone and everything must be *below* Him (if we may assume this analogy #todo/opzoeken  ander woord daarvoor metafoor? three dimensions only). 
This goes not only for His uniqueness of being the mighty Creator of all, but also for His character: no one is as righteous as He is or has done the things to become the Savior He is. 

*22 “Turn to me and be saved,*
*all the ends of the earth!*
*For I am God, and there is no other.*

Everyone needs to turn to God in order to be saved. God wants them to be saved and that is why saying this. God is not arguing why this is necessary. He is not saying that if we do not turn to Him, then we will be punished—He has said that before, but that was as a message for the Jews, as a hope and as a prediction. Now He is talking to the ends of the world, that is everyone, including the Jews. The only reason He gives us for why we should turn to Him is because *He is God*. No other explanation is needed. 
Being *God* already means He can do everything He wants. It means He will be on the winning side and you will be as well if you are on His side. It means you will share in the spoils, if it were for a normal king, but because this is a spiritual and godly king you will share in spiritual spoils. You will share from the riches of His glory. Even with a human king you would not be granted this much unless it is a very generous king, but our God is good and generous and merciful. He gives so much more than we deserve—as long as we are on His side.

*23 By myself I have sworn;*
*from my mouth has gone out in righteousness*
*a word that shall not return:*
*To me every knee shall bow,*
*every tongue shall swear allegiance.’*

What does it mean when it is said that a word shall not return? #biblestudy/questions
Perhaps it means that God has sworn and when He has, He only needs to say it once. This sentence He said will not be repeated and it will not be said again. He is—in fact—giving the rest of the world only one chance of hearing this. 
However, it seems like I have have seen this verse elsewhere in the Bible, in Revelations for example. But even if this verse would not appear anywhere in the Bible, it is still heard in many sermons and in at least a few songs. So probably the word "return" has nothing to do with a one-time chance of hearing it. 
Most likely it has nothing to do with a one-time chance of accepting God either, because God still commands us to go out into the world and make disciples of *all nations*.
The only possibility left that I can see is that this is the only chance heathens got to convert to Judaism, until His Son Jesus Christ would come.

*24 “Only in the Lord, it shall be said of me,*
*are righteousness and strength;*
*to him shall come and be ashamed*
*all who were incensed against him.*
*25 In the Lord all the offspring of Israel*
*shall be justified and shall glory.”* #todo/opzoeken  glory as verb?

*Only* in the Lord are righteousness and strength. That is a true statement. No other god heeds as much attention to righteousness and strength as our God. There are stories or myths about gods who showed some righteousness, but these are worthless compared to what our God has done. Our God has a *quid pro quo* righteousness, an eye for an eye, a life for a life. Though we cannot see all of the punishments and rewards God has given to the people mentioned in the Bible, we may know that He punished, for example, the bad kings mentioned in 1 and 2 Kings. 
God even punished David because of his many wives with all kinds of trouble in his family and his first two sons, Amnon and Absalom were killed because of their own sin. Absalom revolted against his own father, (most probably) because David did not stand up against the sins of Amnon against Tamar. 
This shows that God is righteous, even to those after His own heart. Would He not be then against those who are farther from His heart? 
If we compare this to Hinduism and for example the god Shiva whose son, Ganesha, was decapitated. Shiva could not find his head and so he replaced his head with that of an elephant. Where is the righteousness in that if Ganesha has to live all of his life with an elephant head? Where is the strength of Shiva? Sure, it requires some power to replace a head and still keep a person alive, but it is nothing compared to the power of God Who can raise the dead and give us a new body!
Then what about Pallas Athena and Medusa. Medusa, even if she seduced the gods by wearing inappropriate clothes, was raped by Poseidon and punished for having sex in Athena's temple. Medusa was turned into an ugly looking monster with poisonous snakes as hairs and never being able to look at people anymore. Where is the righteousness for Medusa? There is none. Or all of the other religions have a different definition or interpretation of righteousness. 
The world has gone soft. Whereas in the classical and medieval times punishments were so hard and cruel they outdid righteousness and forgot mercy, in present times they so soft that death sentences are not allowed in many countries and states, lifelong imprisonment amounts between 15 up to 35 years with parole, even for double or multiple homicides, or comparable atrocities such as rape, human trafficking, slavery and child pornography. Let alone drug deals who have killed thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people, though over a longer period of time. 
Where has righteousness gone in this world? It is gone, or almost gone, because God has gone from their world as well. As long as they do not accept God as their god, they will not see His righteousness, mercy and strength in the way He was supposed to show it.
