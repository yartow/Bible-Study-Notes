# Isaiah 27
#biblestudy/devotionals/isaiah

**Deliverance of Israel**
*1 In that day,*
*the Lord will punish with his sword —*
*his fierce, great and powerful sword—*
*Leviathan the gliding serpent,*
*Leviathan the coiling serpent;*
*he will slay the monster of the sea.*
*2 In that day —*
*“Sing about a fruitful vineyard:*
*3 I, the Lord, watch over it;*
*I water it continually.*
*I guard it day and night*
*so that no one may harm it.*
*4 I am not angry.*
*If only there were briers and thorns confronting me!*
*I would march against them in battle;*
*I would set them all on fire.*
*5 Or else let them come to me for refuge;*
*let them make peace with me,*
*yes, let them make peace with me.”*

The Lord is a mighty protector. He is not afraid of anyone. He wants "people" to go against Him so He can show how strong He is. Of course He does not like slaying His own people and all people are in a sense His people, so He had rather not that people come towards Him with the wrong motivation. 
But He will slay serpents and monsters such as the Leviathan. Perhaps really a serpent, perhaps the monster of Loch Ness. 
And God speaks of thorns and briers, but even plants are afraid and obey God's Word, as we have seen a tree withering after Jesus cursing it. 

If we go to the Lord with the right intentions He will make peace with us. Really, He will! Though all of us have sinned so much, He is ready to forgive us our sins and wash all of it, not leaving even one single stain, away, forgetting it completely, not bringing it up anymore. There are dozens if not hundreds of Bible verses about that—one of those being in Isaiah 1, where God starts this book by saying He will make us as clean as snow and wool. It will take a lot of time to make wool covered in blood clean. Any menstruating woman can tell that! 

*6 In days to come Jacob will take root,*
*Israel will bud and blossom*
*and fill all the world with fruit.*

This promise is for Israel only. I feel like it applies to the Gentiles as well, and perhaps it is, in a certain sense and up to a certain extent, but the promise originates from a promise for Israel and the Israelites. 
It is Israel who will blossom. The Jews who will prosper. 

*7 Has the Lord struck her*
*as he struck down those who struck her?*
*Has she been killed*
*as those were killed who killed her?*

God has been gentle with His children, the people of Israel. He has punished them, or her, when referring to the country, but not in the same way as the surrounding countries have. 
There were or are three forms of punishment, just like David received the choice between these three things. 
Punishment by other nations, by disease or by .... #todo/opzoeken 
All differ in the duration, the first one being the longest and the last one the shortest, yet most severe. In all cases people would die, and the difference is not so much in the severity, but in who is inflicting this pain. David chose for his country to suffer, because he would rather be in the hands of God than in the hands of man. That is a good motivation, although foreign and human enemies are also in the hands of God. They will not harm a single hair of yours if God does not allow them to.

*8 By warfare and exile you contend with her—*
*with his fierce blast he drives her out,*
*as on a day the east wind blows.*

You contend #todo/opzoeken 
with Israel through warfare and exile. This is what You have used to to let the Israelites know they are wrong. How You have punished them, but still keeping most of them alive in order to know where they came from. 
Whereas other peoples were merciless killed or burned down, only a part of Israel was burnt down.

*9 By this, then, will Jacob’s guilt be atoned for,*
*and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin:*
*When he makes all the altar stones*
*to be like limestone crushed to pieces,*
*no Asherah poles or incense altars*
*will be left standing.*

God *will* avenge, most certainly. He does not only utter words, He will do great acts as He has promised. The altar stones of Ashera and pet gods are gone. That is why we do not see them anymore. We only know them from small artifacts or drawings. If there ever was an Ashera pole found, #todo/opzoeken then the question is whether that was the original one, for God says here that all the poles would be destroyed. Would He have left one as proof for us that the worship of this fake god really existed? Would He have saved it from destruction as an historical artifact, a showcase for us? I do not think so. 
So either God was not meaning this literally, if ever one was found, or they are not the real thing.

*10 The fortified city stands desolate,*
*an abandoned settlement, forsaken like the wilderness;*
*there the calves graze,*
*there they lie down;*
*they strip its branches bare.*
*11 When its twigs are dry, they are broken off*
*and women come and make fires with them.*
*For this is a people without understanding;*
*so their Maker has no compassion on them,*
*and their Creator shows them no favor.*

No matter how strong something was, in the eyes of God it is little and weak. Nothing is ever worth anything relevant compared to God's greatness. So this city of Babylon, or perhaps some other capital of Assyria, or of a country that invaded Israel, was a fortified city, possibly one that no one could invade or conquer—although Babylon had been invaded several times before in history. But the city is dead, it is forsaken, because a city in itself is nothing, it is merely a pile of stones. It is the people who make the city. 
But people, in turn, are worth nothing as well, if there is no soul or spirit in them. Without a soul they are merely dead bodies, and even with a soul, they are still spiritually dead unless God's spirit is living in them. 
Without understanding of the Living God there is no life. Without understanding God, our Maker, does not have compassion on us. This is not a matter of intellect. It is simple and everyone can understand. God say: "I am your Creator" and therefore He is due the honor, praise and glory of this world. Whoever does not give this to Him must receive a lot of grace from God in order to receive His compassion. 
God is graceful in giving these people a chance, several actually, to get to know Him, to look Him up in many ways. In that sense He has already shown His compassion. That is, He has already revealed Himself through the Word and through His Church, where people can go and hear about Him. 
In another sense God has shown compassion for the world by giving them rain and sunshine, blessing over blessings in all kinds of ways. Is America not mostly secular, but are they not at the same time one of the richest people on Earth? That is because of the blessing that came from God's compassion for them. For in the same way one can argue that the people of some African or Asian nations are behaving much better than Americans who not only sin, but have set this as the standard and thereby leading the world into (more) sin, such as the things the Beatles, Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe have done. 
But real compassion, real comfort, the real blessings as spoken of in the Beatitudes occur only for people who are in God, who *understand* that God is their Creator and who have accepted Him as their Savior by surrendering their whole life to Him. This is no big sacrifice when one realizes the real impact of God's work for the world and in us. It is a bag sacrifice to those who do not understand. 

*12 In that day the Lord will thresh from the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, Israel, will be gathered up one by one. 13 And in that day a great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.*

Were there Jews exiled in Egypt at the time of the Assyrian invasion? It would have been very likely, although Egypt herself would have been victim of the Assyrian invasion afterwards. Perhaps they were exiled many years earlier, in the times that the bad kings of Israel lost wars and there was a food shortage all over the land. 
Wherever the Jews were, the Lord will go all the way from the Euphrates, that is from Iraq (I think) to inhabitable parts (I think that is the Wadi, i.e. wherever there is water) of Egypt, assuming that in the desert c.q. deserted parts there are no people living.
