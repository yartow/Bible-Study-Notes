# Isaiah 40 (ESV)
#biblestudy/devotionals/isaiah

**Comfort for God's People**
*1 Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.*
*2 Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,*
*and cry to her*
*that her warfare is ended,*
*that her iniquity is pardoned,*
*that she has received from the Lord's hand*
*double for all her sins.*

Did Israel indeed receive a double portion of the punishment it should have received? If that is what it mean, then it is so. Another interpretation could be that Israel has received a double compensation for everything she has lost, although I would not interpret it like that. 
In the former case, I would explain it as follows. She received punishment through hunger—which caused many deaths—, through the many actions of the king by which many of the Israelites died—among which the wars with the surrounding countries—in the North and and in the South as well, through the captivity by the Babylonians—again, many deaths—and then their harsh treatment in the Babylonian and Persian empires, which might have causes deaths, but which was definitely persecution (see for example the lives of Daniel and his friends, and the story of Esther). 

#todo/opzoeken  What did Jews look like? Different from Arabs and Persians? 
#todo/opzoeken  Esther really existed, grave still present? 

*I* would say that not even a fraction of what Israel really deserves, has come upon her. But my words do not count against those God. Israel has sinned for 400 years since David and many kings have escaped their punishment. Ahaz was killed, but that is about it for him. What was the punishment for his people? There was a king, I forgot his name, but it could have been Manasseh #todo/opzoeken  David Pawson, 
in whose time the economy was doing very well. So much that even in literature from other countries they would write about it. This surely was a good time for the people, low poverty and unemployment rates. Can that be called a punishment. No, not to me; but again, my opinion is not important here. I would rather say that it was a punishment for the believers who were put in an increasingly idolatrous environment. 
Of course there is that punishment of losing the blessings of God and missing out on the real peace that no one can give but God. It is just like the West these days where at least the people around us have well paid jobs and own a house and a car, but their true happiness is nowhere to be found. There lives are superficial, they do not think about their purpose or have hope in an afterlife.
However, I cannot *count* and I do not know the sadness of man nor that of God. Perhaps men's sadness has really amounted to twice that of which they have hurt God and others. If that really is what it means here in verse two, then it is just that. But if that is not what it means, then I presume that God is gracious and has decided to end their sufferings anyway and make way for a Savior to come and save them once and for all. 
In this case note that God decided to end their punishment prematurely because the people had learned their lesson, not because what they had paid was sufficient. 

*3 A voice cries:*
*“In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord;*
*make straight in the desert a highway for our God.*
*4 Every valley shall be lifted up,*
*and every mountain and hill be made low;*
*the uneven ground shall become level,*
*and the rough places a plain.*
*5 And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,*
*and all flesh shall see it together,*
*for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.”*

The way of the Lord needs to be prepared and we must do that, with His power though. 
In the time of Jesus the country was a wilderness. What is a wilderness? It means that plants and flowers grow wildly, without anyone taking care of it, pruning the flowers and taking out the weeds. 
It refers to the people wildly teaching each other doctrines and laying upon them rules. It means that there are flowers of the good kind, but they are in the rough and weeds around them are only making it worse and covering up what is truly beautiful.

In the story of Zacharias, father of John the Baptist, this is clear. He was a flower who needed pruning, which God did by making him mute. 
Even though God does not need a highway, no mountain or uneven ground will slow down the Lord, if He is in a hurry, but the ways must leveled out of respect for God. As John was working to prepare the people for the Lord Jesus, not because Jesus only had 3.5 years of ministry before He had to go and wanted to convert as many people as possible, but because it is the right thing to do. 
If we do this for our customers, we make it easy for them to get a drink, when we put water in front of them, so they do not have to ask, how much more then should we not do this for the Lord of hosts? 
The more we want to see the glory of the Lord revealed, the more we must prepare the way for the Lord, by spreading the Gospel in this world, as much as possible. 
Surely, to us it may seem like a large part of the Gospel we spread around is like smoke dissolving in the air. It seems like it does not enter their hearts nor their heads and only causes them to mock us more, but God has said His word will not return empty. It is filled with the power of the Holy Spirit, so it is not like a beam of light which will lose power after every reflection, or like a wave of sound which weakens the farther it goes. It is diffractive, like most light rays and sound waves are, and once it has entered a person's heart, this heart will change and the love coming out of this heart—which came from the Word—will not be lessened because a part of this love remains in this heart and another part is spread out, but rather the love will be increased. The Holy Spirit *is* God and God is love. So the Holy Spirit Who powers every word of Scripture, puts (i.e. *creates*) love in the heart of whoever hears and is willingly obedient to God.
Whereas light and sounds become weaker the longer the distance and the more diffraction, the Word of God, through the Holy Spirit, becomes ever stronger with every split and spreading of the Gospel to another person. 

**The Word of God Stands Forever**
*6 A voice says, “Cry!”*
*And I said, “What shall I cry?”*
*All flesh is grass,*
*and all its beauty is like the flower of the field.*
*7 The grass withers, the flower fades*
*when the breath of the Lord blows on it;*
*surely the people are grass.*
*8 The grass withers, the flower fades,*
*but the word of our God will stand forever.*

God told Isaiah to cry out, but it is not clear what God told him to cry out. Isaiah implies there is nothing to cry out to when he says that everything is perishable. Though flesh—with which he refers to humans, I suppose, also because he refers to people in verse 7—perishes as well, at least it stays alive for a number of years. But right now it has become like grass, perishing in a matter of days when it has no water.
It perishes even faster when the breath of the Lord blows on it, for what comes out of God's mouth is powerful and His Word stands forever. 
Compared to God's Word, we humans are like grass and have no power to survive at all. We should cling on to His Word, for His Word can let people wither like grass but it can also give great power and strength. 

**The Greatness of God**
*9 Go on up to a high mountain,*
*O Zion, herald of good news;*
*lift up your voice with strength,*
*O Jerusalem, herald of good news;*
*lift it up, fear not;*
*say to the cities of Judah,*
*“Behold your God!”*
*10 Behold, the Lord God comes with might,*
*and his arm rules for him;*
*behold, his reward is with him,*
*and his recompense before him.*

Jerusalem is to tell the other cities of God. Jerusalem was created to be God's favorite city and to be testimony. How could a city do that? Is a city not dead and made of bricks and stones? Yes, but when it is inhabited it is the people who create the culture and the city. 
The people's behavior could influence the other cities.

*11 He will tend his flock like a shepherd;*
*he will gather the lambs in his arms;*
*he will carry them in his bosom,*
*and gently lead those that are with young.*
*12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand*
*and marked off the heavens with a span,*
*enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure*
*and weighed the mountains in scales*
*and the hills in a balance?*

#todo/familytime
Build hills and planes and mountains and waters (seas, rivers) on a piece of cardboard with some wrapping paper covering the cardboard so that it is not visible. After finishing with building, the wrapping paper is removed to unveil that the cardboard is shaped as a big hand. The meaning of this is that everything has always been in God's hand. 

This verse alone speaks of the amazing greatness of God. No matter how small waters are, even as small as the *lake* of Galilee, where the other border is visible with the naked eye, storms could arise there which terrified experienced fishermen. The water there is enough to kill people. It cannot be contained. 
And even a sea as small the Mediterranean can cause shipwrecks to the mightiest ships. 
We cannot imagine as humans how big, how voluminous, how much water there is in a small brook, a lake or a somewhat larger lake, such as Loch Ness, which is so long and so deep, and dark, that it has never been fully explored. With all our technology we cannot search an area, a volume as a matter of fact, so large. 
Even the size of an iceberg, of which the tips are higher than the highest ships, yet of which its body is 90 percent, is incomprehensible for our minuscule minds. 

I have not even spoken about the great seas of the planet, the Atlantic and the Pacific, and other worthy seas such as the Chinese Sea. These are too mighty for us to contain and no man has ever dared to say that there is a ship that can withstand the powers of the ocean, except foolish ones, such as the owner of the Titanic. 
God, however, measures *all* of these waters, even the water in the earth crust, which is perhaps even more than what is above it, in the hollow of one hand, and it does not even fill up that hollow! 
How much water does the hollow of your hand contain? Do you understand now how small we are? 
#todo/familytime How much water does that of the child contain, and that of the parent. Is there anyone with bigger hands? Now take a bucket. How big would hands need to be to contain this water? Would a Goliath be able to? No, probably it would require a BFG. Calculate the correlation between the size of the hands and height, and between the size of the hands and the size of the hollow. Now calculate the size of a giant with hand palms able to contain this bucket of water. Lastly, calculate how big God would be to contain all the waters of the world. 
Also show how big God would (at least) be compared to Earth. 

*13 Who has measured the Spirit of the Lord,*
*or what man shows him his counsel?*

No man, no one, can compare with the Lord. Now God is not even comparing Himself with man, but He is merely asking the question who can *measure* Him? That alone is impossible. Even measuring the Himalayas is almost impossible and we do it by an estimation. The distance of the stars as well cannot even be measured accurately, let alone Him, Who created the stars and everything in it, with stars and planets so far we could probably not even see them. 

*14 Whom did he consult,*
*and who made him understand?*
*Who taught him the path of justice,*
*and taught him knowledge,*
*and showed him the way of understanding?*
*15 Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket,*
*and are accounted as the dust on the scales;*
*behold, he takes up the coastlands like fine dust.*

The things we as humans find magnificent are merely miniatures from God's point of view. The greatest mountains and valleys on Earth, where people see the awesomeness of God—although most do not believe in God and realize He created it, although this is not even a fraction of His awesomeness—are but #todo/opzoeken zandkorrels
grains of sand. To God the Himalayas are but one single grain of sand; He would need to look real careful to see it and not to squish it—even that would be a heavy understatement. 

**The three dimensions of our universe: space, time and matter**
God is infinitely larger than us. Not only does He live outside the realm of time, and is therefore able to know everything that happens in the future and past and present there as well, but He is also outside the realm of space and matter. 
What is outside the realm of matter is unimaginable for us as well. On Earth everything outside of matter would be vacuum, or in other words *nothing*. But the spirit and the soul are not nothing. They cannot be described though and sometimes appear here on Earth, perhaps in a different form than they would in heaven. 
What is outside the realm of space? I really have no clue. A potential way to travel from one end to the other, just like traveling in time? 

Something about light, that too is something that only exists in our universe. God is outside of that and John speaks of that in the book of Revelations. It is clear that John does not understand what he sees in his visions. 

*16 Lebanon would not suffice for fuel,*
*nor are its beasts enough for a burnt offering.*

God is so great. We could write numerous verses about this in the Bible and give multiple explanations on what we can compare His greatness with, but each explanation would do Him no right and would only diminish the image of His greatness. 
The Bible speaks in poetic language, not in absolutes but in shortcomings, as in how everything on Earth would fall short of approaching even a sacrifice for God. For God is great that not even the greatest gift we would give Him, would suffice as an appealing gift.
Verse 16 speaks of the Lebanon, though smaller than the Amazon I suppose, it consists of trees that are probably higher and mightier than those of the Amazon. All the trees and all the beasts of that mountain would not suffice for a burnt offering. Even if we took all the trees and oil and flammable products of this Earth, then still it would not be a worthy burnt offering for God. He created this world and everything in it. He is so many times infinity larger than we are, we simply cannot imagine. He even created the laws in our universe, both the physical as the moral laws. 
We can create an Earth in a laboratory, but we could never create the physical laws, not even in simulation program on a computer. Let alone the moral laws, we do not even know these by heart. 

*17 All the nations are as nothing before him,*
*they are accounted by him as less than nothing and emptiness.*
*18 To whom then will you liken God,*
*or what likeness compare with him?*

As said above: nothing can compare with God! Not even the brightest group of people together can accomplish anything close to God, not even in the last few thousand years!
We cannot even create a community where only goodness prevails as we hear from the many testimonies that even in (Christian) communities murders and divorce take place. 
So morally and scientifically we are deficient. 

*19 An idol! A craftsman casts it,*
*and a goldsmith overlays it with gold*
*and casts for it silver chains.*
*20 He who is too impoverished for an offering*
*chooses wood that will not rot;*
*he seeks out a skillful craftsman*
*to set up an idol that will not move.*

And yet, when we idolize God we diminish Him to a statue who cannot do anything, a piece of wood or metal or stone, *made by man*. The is the ultimate goal of man, to be able to make their own things, to make their own God. 
Dragon Ball depicts, implicitly though, a god who makes his own dragon, which can fulfill any wish which is not beyond his own power. It is like man creating a program or a robot which can do anything he wants. Unfortunately, they do not realize that it never do more than man can, because the created can never exceed the creator. 
This is the whole hinge between evolution and creation, where evolution believes that it is possible the created can become smarter and have more intelligence and the created says this is not possible. On a spiritual field the (new) atheists say they can be smarter than God—even though they do not believe in Him—whereas the Christians state that we will always stay under God. 

*21 Do you not know? Do you not hear?*
*Has it not been told you from the beginning?*
*Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?*
*22 It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,*
*and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;*
*who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,*
*and spreads them like a tent to dwell in;*
*23 who brings princes to nothing,*
*and makes the rulers of the earth as emptiness.*
*24 Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown,*
*scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth,*
*when he blows on them, and they wither,*
*and the tempest carries them off like stubble.*

Man does not realize how scarcely they have been sown across the Earth. They think they are so big that the Earth is overpopulated, that all the resources of the Earth are not enough to feed every mouth. 
Even with all these big mouths of the West, which eat too much meat anyway, the whole Earth would be more than sufficient. Vast areas of the Earth have not been used yet and can be used for crops and vegetables, for trees and for animals to graze on. 
The people on this Earth think they are so powerful they have caused global warming with the production of CO2 usage. They do not realize that the Earth is way too big for man to conquer. Vast areas of the jungle have never been explored, vast areas within the mountains, both in the (rain)forests as well as in the colder areas still contain secrets of generations past, such as lost civilizations. 
The biggest bomb on the planet, I believe, could not even wipe out the simplest mountain. It could merely blast off a piece of it and with its radioactivity kill off all living things. But even then nature would restore itself as it has done in Chernobyl. 
Humans should not think greater of themselves than they are, but unfortunately this is inherently built in us, not by God, but by sin caused by Adam. 

*25 To whom then will you compare me,*
*that I should be like him? says the Holy One.*
*26 Lift up your eyes on high and see:*
*who created these?*
*He who brings out their host by number,*
*calling them all by name;*
*by the greatness of his might*
*and because he is strong in power,*
*not one is missing.*

Comparing God to something or someone is utterly futile and insulting. Of course, when illustrating things to someone who does not understand this is—perhaps—acceptable, but for all other purposes it would be diminishing God's greatness. 
Once again, we cannot imagine how great God is, but here is just one thing He mentions of His own: who created the stars? 
The people in that time knew there were innumerous #todo/opzoeken stars, too much to be counted. Partially due to light pollution it is almost impossible in the West to see that many stars as Abraham or Isaiah used to see, even on a clear night. But what we know, that they do not know, is that we have one such star in our own galaxy, the Sun. 
We know the sun is so much greater in size than all the other planets, that it is burning and having nuclear reactions through core fusion all the time. 

#todo/opzoeken  Why is it so much colder on other planets? Because of the distance? Diffusion of radiation? 

We have never *seen* another star than the sun, but we know there are billions of them in the galaxy, some which are—we think—many times bigger than the sun.
How many are there? We have not even been able to *count*, because there are too many. In every square millimeter of our eye view, we can zoom in and find billions of stars, and when we zoom in again between those stars, we find the same. There are simply too many. However, God knows the number and He knows each number of each star and its associated name. He even knows when one is missing.
So we have never seen more of a star than just a dot, we cannot count them, we do not know how they have come into existence and we can only speculate about what happens when they die. But God knows everything, He knows all the answers to these questions and He knows how to create these stars, because that in fact is what He has done. That is truly amazing.

*27 Why do you say, O Jacob,*
*and speak, O Israel,*
*“My way is hidden from the Lord,*
*and my right is disregarded by my God”?*
*28 Have you not known? Have you not heard?*
*The Lord is the everlasting God,*
*the Creator of the ends of the earth.*
*He does not faint or grow weary;*
*his understanding is unsearchable.*

We should never say that God is not looking upon us. He has already seen us a thousand years before we were born and He knows how we are going to end up. How can He not see us then? Or are we theists, thinking that God created the world, looks upon it but lets everything run its own course. The Bible obviously does not say that! 
The Bible speaks of God's love, of His intervention and His rescue even when we think we have it all together. God blessed and helped Jacob with the breeding of his sheep. He changed the course of history by sending his angel to defeat Sennacherib's army. He definitely intervenes and *always* for the good. 
Does He understand us? We are unable to understand our own children because we have grown out of it and do not remember, but God has never been a child so how could He remember? 
Indeed, He has not been a human child Who grew up to become a man and then God, but that is exactly why He chose to become human, so that He could feel our feelings and experience our weaknesses and become a sacrifice worthy to replace any human. In a sense it is also to prove that *even with human emotions* and *without Godly powers* He is still strong enough to withhold the temptation to sin and the temptation for lust. He withstood the lust for food and women, for riches and power, and He withstood the temptations of impatience, judging and revenge, while he had every chance. In some situations it probably would not even have been for Jesus to punish a man or woman, such as the stoning of that woman—for Jesus was indeed without sin and it was and still is (I suppose) part of the law—but He chose not to, in order to express the power of His forgiveness.
So does God or Jesus understand us? Most definitely *yes*. How much does He understand us? Does He understand women as well, and gays and transgenders, how they feel? 
I cannot say *no*, for then God would not be omnipotent, but He never has been incarnated as a woman on Earth or any other type. Then again, God has created everything and He can imagine how things would have been like. God can create hypothetical situations a relive those situations in order to know how it feels, or He can do it in another way. 
I—as well as the rest of us humans—do not know how He does it, but what we do know is that God's understanding of us and our feelings is unsearchable, which means it is far above our minds to be able to understand it. But we may be sure that He *does* understand us.

*29 He gives power to the faint,*
*and to him who has no might he increases strength.*

Note that this promise is only for those who have no might. Those who do will not have their strength increased—partially because those with might depend on themselves instead of on God. On the other hand, it could be that this is a relative issue, meaning that even those who have a lot of strength is like someone without strength when it comes to very strenuous tasks. 

*30 Even youths shall faint and be weary,*
*and young men shall fall exhausted;*
::*31 but they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength;*::
::*they shall mount up with wings like eagles;*::
::*they shall run and not be weary;*::
::*they shall walk and not faint.*::

I have once written a piece on this part, an exegesis on the meanings of each of the verbs in this key verse, which is so well-known across the Internet and the world. But it has much more meaning than that of course, books would not bet be enough to describe the true meaning and depth of this verse. For the Word is living and cannot be contained in a commentary. It will jump right out and grow out of it. For each living person it has meaning *every day*. So a book consisting of 7 billion messages growing with every day, *might* be enough only to *maintain* the messages captured therein until that day, but surely it will not be enough for the next day. 
In this case, today, this verse is about the people who *wait for the Lord* who shall renew their strength. Am I waiting? 
Waiting is not the same thing as watching time goes by, living my own life until something happens. *Waiting* here means to look forward to, or in other words *expecting*. Otherwise *everyone* would be waiting for the Lord's second coming, but they are not. 
Most of the people are waiting to die, or to win the lottery. Some are waiting for a girlfriend and others are not waiting at all, but are busy with work and everything around them.
As Christians though we should be waiting for His coming, for His purpose for us to be made clear so that we can act upon it. In my personal case I am one of those busy people, but I am doing it all with the purpose of waiting for His answer and His provision. He will provide helpers for our congregation and for Celebrate Recovery, He will provide the harvest and newcomers to our small groups and communities. He will also provide the equipment with which we can serve Him and our fellowmen.
