# Isaiah 14
#biblestudy/devotionals/isaiah 

*Isaiah 14 (NIV)* 
*1 The Lord will have compassion on Jacob;*
*once again he will choose Israel*
*and will settle them in their own land.*
*Foreigners will join them*
*and unite with the descendants of Jacob.*

It is not because Jacob is behaving himself or has changed, it is also no because God has a promise to keep, it is because God has *compassion* on Jacob *chooses* to save Israel. 
Jacob refused to share their privilege with other people, now God has taken the initiative to put foreigners in their country. Unfortunately they have not used that opportunity to proselytize the Samaritans. God gave the Jews another chance around the time of Jesus' presence on Earth, when many Romans lived in their country, to convert the Romans to their religion, but again they failed to do so. Their last chance is the current one, where Arabs live in Israel, but now too they fail to provide a good example of being a child of God, by excluding other people from enjoying the good that the country has to offer. 

*2 Nations will take them*
*and bring them to their own place.*
*And Israel will take possession of the nations*
*and make them male and female servants in the Lord’s land.*
*They will make captives of their captors*
*and rule over their oppressors.*

Israel has forgotten her benefactor. She has taken back possession of the Lord's land, but forgotten that it was the Persians who allowed them to return. 

*3 On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labor forced on you, 4 you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon:*
*How the oppressor has come to an end!*
*How his fury has ended!*
*5 The Lord has broken the rod of the wicked,*
*the scepter of the rulers,*
*6 which in anger struck down peoples*
*with unceasing blows,*
*and in fury subdued nations*
*with relentless aggression.*

The fact that the Lord will break the rod of the wicked indicates that the wicked already have a rod and a scepter. Of course we know this if we look around us. Dictatorship is present in some countries, but in poorer countries such as India and some African countries, though not always a dictatorship, it is the rich who rule, and not for the good, but for their own wickedness. 

*7 All the lands are at rest and at peace;*
*they break into singing.*
*8 Even the junipers and the cedars of Lebanon*
*gloat over you and say,*
*“Now that you have been laid low,*
*no one comes to cut us down.”*
*9 The realm of the dead below is all astir*
*to meet you at your coming;*

It took me a while to understand this, but now I understand that it is Israel singing this tout to Babylon.
Babylon has been struck down and now Israel and every other nation that has been conquered by her is laughing at her. 
The ones who are still alive are even rejoicing for now, at last, there is peace, so much peace that even the trees are rejoicing for even they were cut down in times of war.

*it rouses the spirits of the departed to greet you—*
*all those who were leaders in the world;*
*it makes them rise from their thrones—*
*all those who were kings over the nations.*
*10 They will all respond,*
*they will say to you,*
*“You also have become weak, as we are;*
*you have become like us.”*
*11 All your pomp has been brought down to the grave,*
*along with the noise of your harps;*
*maggots are spread out beneath you*
*and worms cover you.*

Babylon was haughty, but she faces the same fate as the kings that she killed. She too has maggots and worms with her in the ground. 
In death all are equal, that is equally poor and equally weak.

*12 How you have fallen from heaven,*
*morning star, son of the dawn!*
*You have been cast down to the earth,*
*you who once laid low the nations!*
*13 You said in your heart,*
*“I will ascend to the heavens;*
*I will raise my throne*
*above the stars of God;*
*I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly,*
*on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon.*
*14 I will ascend above the tops of the clouds;*
*I will make myself like the Most High.”*
*15 But you are brought down to the realm of the dead,*
*to the depths of the pit.*

This is an almost exact description of what happened to Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel, although this prophecy was written around 700 BC and the events in Daniel occurred at around 400 BC. #todo/opzoeken  exacte tijden

*16 Those who see you stare at you,*
*they ponder your fate:*
*“Is this the man who shook the earth*
*and made kingdoms tremble,*
*17 the man who made the world a wilderness,*
*who overthrew its cities*
*and would not let his captives go home?”*
*18 All the kings of the nations lie in state,*
*each in his own tomb.*
*19 But you are cast out of your tomb*
*like a rejected branch;*
*you are covered with the slain,*
*with those pierced by the sword,*
*those who descend to the stones of the pit.*
*Like a corpse trampled underfoot,*
*20 you will not join them in burial,*
*for you have destroyed your land*
*and killed your people.*
*Let the offspring of the wicked*
*never be mentioned again.*

Babylon was not only famous for its large kingdom, but notorious for having no mercy as well. She killed her own land and own people, the took captives but did not release them.
Apparently Babylon is not equal to others in death in one field, for she will not receive a grave, a tomb or a burial. She will not even be mentioned again, both of which are serious [...other word for impact?] on Babylon's honor and of all those living in the Middle East.

*21 Prepare a place to slaughter his children*
*for the sins of their ancestors;*
*they are not to rise to inherit the land*
*and cover the earth with their cities.*
*22 “I will rise up against them,”*
*declares the Lord Almighty.*
*“I will wipe out Babylon’s name and survivors,*
*her offspring and descendants, ”*
*declares the Lord.*

God goes even further in dishonoring Babylon by slaughtering her children as well so that no one can inherit the land, that was destroyed anyway.

*23 “I will turn her into a place for owls*
*and into swampland;*
*I will sweep her with the broom of destruction, ”*
*declares the Lord Almighty.*
*::24 The Lord Almighty has sworn,::*
*::“Surely, as I have planned, so it will be,::*
*::and as I have purposed, so it will happen.::*
*25 I will crush the Assyrian in my land;*
*on my mountains I will trample him down.*
*His yoke will be taken from my people,*
*and his burden removed from their shoulders. ”*
*26 This is the plan determined for the whole world;*
*this is the hand stretched out over all nations.*
*::27 For the Lord Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart him?::*
*::His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?::*

Some—in that time—will not believe and say this will not happen, because they still see Babylon as the world power. But God has sworn this and emphasizes that what He has planned, not even *promised*, but simply planned, that will happen, and if He has *purposed* is, it will surely happen and there is no one who can turn God from His plans. 

**A Prophecy Against the Philistines**
*28 This prophecy came in the year King Ahaz died:*
*29 Do not rejoice, all you Philistines,*
*that the rod that struck you is broken;*
*from the root of that snake will spring up a viper,*
*its fruit will be a darting, venomous serpent.*

Who is the snake? The snake is Babylon who killed both Israelites and Philistines. Now that Babylon has died the Philistines thought their punishment was over, but a new snake, a viper, even more poisonous will come and be more deadly than the snake before.

*30 The poorest of the poor will find pasture,*
*and the needy will lie down in safety.*
*But your root I will destroy by famine;*
*it will slay your survivors.*

#todo/opzoeken Is it indeed true that the Philistines do not exist anymore? Where are they now then? And where are and who were the Neo-Babylonians? 

If I am correct, there are no more Philistines, at least not by bloodline. All have perished or are unaware of their heritage. But I think the former is true, because God claims this and I think He means it literally. 
Who are the poor? I might be able to understand why they have survived, they could have had no part in the war against Israel. Instead, they were victims of the Philistines themselves. According to MacArthur they are Israelian poor people, but I would not know why Israelian people are mentioned in a part that is addressed to Philistines.
A question aside, if there were still any Philistines, would they have right to the land of Israel? The world would see Israel as a military troupe seizing power in a country, like what happened in Zimbabwe and Uganda. The Philistines would be the rightful owners. But the same thing would apply to other countries. Should the Native Americans own all of America? Should the original inhabitants of Vietnam, Taiwan and Australia, and even to go as far as the whole of South America, which has not inhabited, be returned to its "rightful owners"? If so, then we should apply the same standard to all countries, but everyone knows that this is not an option or at least not a wise option. 
The original peoples of any country never possessed all of the land, there were not enough people to populate all of it. 
OK, then what about paying for damages done by the foreigners? Should we pay these back? That is what the States and Australia have done to their native people. Indeed, and it has caused only drunkenness and misery by letting them enjoy their rights without having worked for it. But aside from that, should Israel do that to the Philistines if they were to still be alive? 
The answer is no, Israel is completely different from all other countries. Why? Because God intervened. The Israelites did not conquer Israel, or Canaan at that time, on their own power or by their own will. It was God Who led them there and Who gave them victory.
Where the proof of this is? Few other country have ever been able to conquer Jerusalem, except for the Jews. The Babylonians had done so in 587BC, after an 18-month siege, but the Jews have done it in a much shorter time, in 1967 even in six days. 
It is a sovereign decision of God to do so. Other countries or peoples cannot take this example. This is the right thing, simply because God has decided it to be so.  

*31 Wail, you gate! Howl, you city!*
*Melt away, all you Philistines!*
*A cloud of smoke comes from the north,*
*and there is not a straggler in its ranks.*

I have looked up the Six Day War on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War) and the irony is that Wikipedia speaks of Palestinian stragglers. Now this has nothing to do with the above, for Palestinians are not the same as Philistines and verse 31 is about (the absence of) *Israelian* stragglers and not those of Palestine. Anyhow, this is what the article said, also using the word "straggler":
> It has been alleged that Nasser did not want Egypt to learn of the true extent of his defeat and so ordered the killing of Egyptian army stragglers making their way back to the Suez canal zone.  
> There have also been allegations from both Israeli and Egyptian sources that Israeli troops killed unarmed Egyptian prisoners  

*32 What answer shall be given*
*to the envoys of that nation?*
*“The Lord has established Zion,*
*and in her his afflicted people will find refuge. ”*

Since there are allegations, there are always questions as to what is the truth. For example, *what happened to those unarmed Egyptian prisoners?* Or in other words, *what answer shall be given (to Egypt)?* This is strikingly similar. 
Once again, this verse must not be taken out of its context and mis- or reinterpreted in today's context, just so that it (seems like it) fulfills a prophecy. This is about the envoys of the Philistines, who will come to Israel at that time to make peace (or, according to MacArthur, to seek an alliance).
Egypt (having an alliance with the Palestinians) has indeed sought a peace treaty on June 11, 1967.
