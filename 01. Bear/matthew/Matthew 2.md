# Matthew 2
*Matthew 2:1-12 (NIV) 1 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem 2 and asked, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.”*

Who were the Magi and how did they know a king was born just by looking at a star? 
Some people are superstitious and believe they can read stars or read the lines on your hand. They say that some lines on your hand mean that you are going to live very long, if that line is very long. Or they will say that some stars in the sky mean that today is going to be a good or a bad day. 
Of course this is not true! But even though it is not true, God can still use it. This time He used these Magi who were looking at the stars to let them interpret that a king was born, and not just a king, but the king of all kings!

*3 When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.*

If you hear that the king of the Netherlands is coming to your city, would you feel glad about that? Then what if the king of an ever bigger country, such as the United States, the president, would come here, would that not be an even greater honor? 
Why then was King Herod not pleased hearing that Jesus would come? There is only one reason, and that is **pride**. 
Now pride is something that can be good or bad. If you say you are proud of someone, that usually is a good thing to say, because you find this person's achievements of worth. You can even say you are proud of yourself. It gets problematic when you start being proud of yourself if you have not achieved anything.
Now King Herod was proud of him being a king, but he did not *achieve* anything to become a king. He got it handed to him by the Romans. He also did not have any *rights* to be a king, for he was not from David's bloodline nor was he even Jewish! 
So it was wrong for him to be proud of a position he had, while he did not deserve. But besides being wrong, he was **afraid** as well of losing his throne and his power. 

*4 When he had called together all the people’s chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born. 5 “In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for this is what the prophet has written:*
*6 “‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,*
*are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;*
*for out of you will come a ruler*
*who will shepherd my people Israel.’”*
*7 Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. 8 He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.”*
*9 After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. 10 When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. 11 On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. 12 And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.*
