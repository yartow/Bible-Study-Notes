Mark 8:22-26 (ESV) Jesus Heals a Blind Man at Bethsaida
> 22 And they came to Bethsaida. And some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him. 23 And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village, and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him, “Do you see anything?” 24 And he looked up and said, “I see people, but they look like trees, walking.” 25 Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again; and he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. 26 And he sent him to his home, saying, “Do not even enter the village.”  

This indicates that either the man had been able to see before and recognized the trees, or that Jesus healing brought not only sight, but knowledge as well. 

The reason the people looked like trees is because Jesus actually showed the man what these people were. Many seem or claim to be believers, but in fact they are just walking vegetation, alive but not alive at the same time. This it the case with many around us as well and it is for this reason that Jesus warned the man not to enter the village. 
One that has just begun to see clearly should not be among such people.
