# Psalm 149
*Praise the Lord . Sing to the Lord a new song,*

As said before a few times in the psalter, sing a *new* song to the Lord. Praise the Lord for the new things He has created. New in the sense of something that you have not praised Him for before, but also in the sense of something that is fresh, such as a new hope, a new day, a new child or a new job. 
Thank You, Lord, for giving me a new opportunity to serve You in a different way. When I have my next job, I can serve You from some place else and I can show others the sweetness of Your love.
Thank You for quick changes in my life, so that I may grow quickly as well. Thank You for the chance to become a deacon in the church, and the chance to change jobs, perhaps even into a different sector, which I am sure of will prove useful according to Your purpose.

*his praise in the assembly of his faithful people. Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the people of Zion be glad in their King.*

I fear for the people who Israel, I fear for their fate. They have become so far lost from Your Law, I am wondering if they even still call themselves Jews. They do not appreciate You as their King. They are not interested in Your Word, perhaps not even in Your traditions.

*Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp.*

Thank You, Lord, for giving me the gift of music and knowing how to appreciate almost every aspect of it, the tone, the melody, the rhythm, the instruments, the musician and singer, the beat, the chorus and structure, the style and much more.
Lord, every aspect of music worships and praises You, for You are the inventor of music. You gave us a way to praise You and this way relieves us of our sadness as well. By focusing ourselves on Your greatness, instead of ourselves and our problems, You bless us in all kinds of ways.

*For the Lord takes delight in his people; he crowns the humble with victory. Let his faithful people rejoice in this honor and sing for joy on their beds.*
*Psalm 149:1-5 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.149.1-5.NIV*

Lord, let me be faithful, let me not forget You in any circumstance. Let me always remember that You are the One Who redeemed me from the pit and satisfied me with good things, so that my youth is renewed (ref. Psalm 103) which is the reason why I am still so hopeful and energetic, full of peace and praise for You and patience for others.

David asks that people may even praise You while in their bed, while they are sleeping or when they just wake up. Let it be the first thing on their minds when they wake up.

*May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands,*

May everything they do, but especially when taking vengeance, be with praise for You *and* Your Law, that is Your Word, in their hands so that no one will do anything that is not according to Your Word. 
Lord, I pray for a country, a world actually, where Your will is done. Even right now, where no one is perfect, this could be approximated. Let this country be created to show the world what this would look like, the low numbers of mortality, high numbers of literacy, and zero abortions, euthanasia, homosexuals and crime.
I believe this is a country that can exist, but I do not know whether it would convince the world that Your Law is the best and whether we, as salt, should be piled up in one country.
Rwanda, however, is a good example that leads other countries to believe that Your Word is actually true and has shown its results.

*to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with shackles of iron, to carry out the sentence written against themâ€” this is the glory of all his faithful people. Praise the Lord .*
*Psalm 149:6-9 NIV*

For the nations who try to harm God's people I have no mercy, for the kings and judges who have judged and ruled over the persecution of Christians, I call out Your wrath, Lord.
The kings and judges of Muslim countries in Africa and the middle East, the religious leaders of Hindu extremism, for all of them I wish them to be shackled and thrown in prison. To bring You glory.
