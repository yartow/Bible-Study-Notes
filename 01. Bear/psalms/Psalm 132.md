# Psalm 132
*Lord , remember David and all his self-denial.*

David is speaking here to himself in the third person, I do not know why, perhaps because it is less humble to ask things for oneself.
But David denied himself and he is, not afraid to speak about this openly and put it before You, because he knows You are aware of it.
Lord, let me become like David, that I may honestly say that I have denied myself, or even more, like Jesus, that I have denied myself in everything.

*He swore an oath to the Lord , he made a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob: “I will not enter my house or go to my bed, I will allow no sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids, till I find a place for the Lord , a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”*
*Psalm 132:1-5 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.132.1-5.NIV*

David is very bold in daring to swear an oath, and I am not sure if that is the right thing to do, or better said, I am sure of it that it is wrong.
First of all, he cannot swear not to sleep, because building a temple for the Lord takes years. Or even finding a place for the Lord, is dependent on when God speaks and tells where this place is.
Second of all, David did not know whether God wanted him to find a place or build it.
But of course his intentions and his zeal is remarkable.

**We heard it in Ephrathah, we came upon it in the fields of Jaar: “Let us go to his dwelling place, let us worship at his footstool, saying, ‘Arise, Lord , and come to your resting place, you and the ark of your might.**

Lord, let our promises be heard all over the world, that Christians alike want to find not a resting place for You, for You do not need one, but to make places of worship for You.

**May your priests be clothed with your righteousness; may your faithful people sing for joy.’ ”**
*Psalm 132:6-9 NIV*

*For the sake of your servant David, do not reject your anointed one. The Lord swore an oath to David, a sure oath he will not revoke: “One of your own descendants I will place on your throne. If your sons keep my covenant and the statutes I teach them, then their sons will sit on your throne for ever and ever.”*
*Psalm 132:10-12 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.132.10-12.NIV*

You have kept Your end of the deal, but the Jews have not.

**For the Lord has chosen Zion, he has desired it for his dwelling, saying, “This is my resting place for ever and ever; here I will sit enthroned, for I have desired it.**

The Lord has chosen Jerusalem as its resting place. Even though there was a time when Israel was taken by other countries, it has been given back to the Jews, after a period of almost two thousand years without a country. It seems like the Jews finally called out to God after World War II and God heard their cries, like He did in Egypt.
Perhaps the Jews were disobedient at that time as well. Of course the Egyptians, just like the Germans, had a fear for Jews, for their power and number, but before WWII the Jews themselves were greedy and perhaps put business on a higher place than God. They certainly did not worship God in the right way, because they left out Jesus.
God surely has a reason for letting people suffer. It may not be true what I write, but it is definitely plausible.
And now, after God heard the cries of the Israelites, He gave them back their country and nation, though they had to fight for it. Where no other army succeeded in the capture of Jerusalem, the Jews did within a few days. Obviously with the help of God.
So the Lord Almighty has started a new period with new chances. It has been seventy years now and the Jews still have not changed. It seems to me like this was a last chance to come to Christ.
God surely rests in Jerusalem, but this does not mean everyone in Jerusalem will be saved.

*I will bless her with abundant provisions; her poor I will satisfy with food. I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her faithful people will ever sing for joy.*
*Psalm 132:13-16 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.132.13-16.NIV*

When God gives a blessing it is abundant, and not just a person himself is blessed, but all those around him as well. Imagine what would happen if a whole country is blessed.
First of all, what would happen in the country itself? The poor will be satisfied, the priests will be saved and the faithful people will be joyful. Can I interpret this as *there will be no more poverty, the spiritual leaders will have much influence and make many converts and faithful people will have peace and rest without stumbling blocks*? 
That almost sounds like heaven.

*“Here I will make a horn grow for David and set up a lamp for my anointed one. I will clothe his enemies with shame, but his head will be adorned with a radiant crown.”*
*Psalm 132:17-18 NIV*

David will have strength as a king, and even though David does not live here anymore, this horn is still in Jerusalem. It is still a place for many people where they regain their hope and strength.
And still Israel's enemies are clothed with shame, for they cannot invade it, boycott it or attack it with rockets, and they cannot protect themselves from Israel's actions either.
