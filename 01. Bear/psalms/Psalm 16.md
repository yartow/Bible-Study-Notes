# Psalm 16
*Psalm 16:1-4 NIV*

*Keep me safe, my God, for in you I take refuge.*

*I say to the Lord , “You are my Lord; apart from you I have no good thing.” I say of the holy people who are in the land, “They are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.” Those who run after other gods will suffer more and more. I will not pour out libations of blood to such gods or take up their names on my lips.*

TODO what is libation?

There is an attitude to change for me, to let it be such as David's. He really wants to be with God and only that.

*Psalm 16:5-8 NIV*

*Lord , you alone are my portion and my cup; you make my lot secure. The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance. I will praise the Lord , who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me. I keep my eyes always on the Lord . With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken.*

Everything he entrusts to the Lord, his life, his career, and his future inheritance. The boundary lines, no matter where they have fallen, are in pleasant places. By definition, because God placed them there. David probably did not have known that Israel was the crossroads of the major roads in history, the Silk Route, for example, but still he knew that Israel was the chosen land.
SURELY, I have a delightful inheritance. I should really follow his example. Wherever God places me, it is there that I will receive blessing.

If I follow the Lord so much to give everything to Him of my whole life, God will also use my nights to honor Him. My heart will be His, and He will instruct me in what is right and wrong, show me His ways in my dreams, and bless my sleep.
Especially notice that David mentions, once more as in the previous Psalter, that he will not be shaken with God by his side.

*Psalm 16:9-11 NIV*

*Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest secure, because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, nor will you let your faithful one see decay. You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.* 

God leads the way here on Earth so I can go to heaven. And this way is full of joy and pleasure, both for us as for God. (Although joy and pleasure are differently in heaven than on Earth.)
