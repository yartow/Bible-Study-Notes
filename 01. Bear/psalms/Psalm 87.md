# Psalm 87
*Psalm 87:1-2 NIV*

*He has founded his city on the holy mountain. The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the other dwellings of Jacob.*

TODO Is it possible that God loves one tribe, one person, more than others, while He created all of them?
It says so here.

*Psalm 87:3-6 NIV*

*Glorious things are said of you, city of God: “I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me— Philistia too, and Tyre, along with Cush —*

No matter the translation, whether this means that Rahab and the other countries acknowledge God or that they should listen to these words, the fact remains they should listen or they already believe that is Almighty and has shown that in His works.
Rahab and Babylon have faced the wrath of God, their kings personally being doomed and punished by God, for treating His people so bad.

*and will say, ‘This one was born in Zion.’ ” Indeed, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one were born in her, and the Most High himself will establish her.” The Lord will write in the register of the peoples: “This one was born in Zion.”*

TODO OPZOEKEN Which heroes were born in Zion?

Wherever the Lord is, only good will come out to it. If the Lord blesses your house, your house will give birth to godly men and women. If He blesses your work, your company will surely make profit. If He blesses your life, the fruit will be good, for people to see and to experience.

In the country of Israel, but especially in Zion (?) we see heroes like David (though he was from Bethlehem, and other kings after him (though David could not have known that).
Perhaps the prophets and judges were considered heroes as well.

*Psalm 87:7 NIV*

*As they make music they will sing, “All my fountains are in you.”*

If I make music and I know that all of my inspiration is from You. The music, the melody, the composition, the lyrics, the instruments ensemble or solos, the voice I have in my mind, the story, the performance, the play, the style, the memorization, everything, yes everything, is from You alone.
