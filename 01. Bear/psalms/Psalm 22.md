# Psalm 22
*For the director of music. To the tune of “The Doe of the Morning.” A psalm of David.* 

*1 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?*
*Why are you so far from saving me,*
*so far from my cries of anguish?*
*2 My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer,*
*by night, but I find no rest.[b]* 

It is not God Who has left us, but rather we who have left Him. How much of our time do we spend on thinking about Him, reading from His Word?
It is hard, however, to think that a man like David could not hear God's voice. In which period was this piece written?

*3 Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One;*
*you are the one Israel praises.[c]*
*4 In you our ancestors put their trust;*
*they trusted and you delivered them.*
*5 To you they cried out and were saved;*
*in you they trusted and were not put to shame.* 

But no matter whether we hear from You or not, we should always cry out to You and You alone. No one else deserves our full attention and trust.

*6 But I am a worm and not a man,*
*scorned by everyone, despised by the people.*
*7 All who see me mock me;*
*they hurl insults, shaking their heads.*
*8 “He trusts in the Lord,” they say,*
*“let the Lord rescue him.*
*Let him deliver him,*
*since he delights in him.”* 

In the eyes of the world we are just insects, one out of many billion. They know You are our God, bu the have no respect for us, because they do not know what to look up to. They do not know that it is they who need to be delivered.

*9 Yet you brought me out of the womb;*
*you made me trust in you, even at my mother’s breast.*
*10 From birth I was cast on you;*
*from my mother’s womb you have been my God.* 

I thank You Lord for bringing me to You even since I was a baby. I have been blessed by You by knowing of Your existence since I was little, never having doubted in Your existence, although I have sinned against You, but doubting Your almightiness and goodness.

No matter how the world treats us, You still let us be born in this world, so that we might know You are our God, so we can get support from You and praise and worship You for all that You are. You did not prevent us from getting hurt, for that reason.
But even though the world perceives us as insignificant beings, You did not and You thought I was worthy enough to be brought into this world.

*11 Do not be far from me,*
*for trouble is near*
*and there is no one to help.*
*12 Many bulls surround me;*
*strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.*
*13 Roaring lions that tear their prey*
*open their mouths wide against me.* 

Please let me be aware that You are always with me, to help me. Please let me not be strong on my own or even try to or think so, let me get support from You at all times and always in the first place.

*14 I am poured out like water,*
*and all my bones are out of joint.*
*My heart has turned to wax;*
*it has melted within me.*
*15 My mouth[d] is dried up like a potsherd,*
*and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth;*
*you lay me in the dust of death.* 

No matter what I say or how I act, You know that I am weak on the inside. Without You there is nothing I can do or say, I have no authority or wisdom, if it is not given by You. I do not know what to say, if You do not put the words in my mouth.

*16 Dogs surround me,*
*a pack of villains encircles me;*
*they pierce[e] my hands and my feet.*
*17 All my bones are on display;*
*people stare and gloat over me.*
*18 They divide my clothes among them*
*and cast lots for my garment.*
*19 But you, Lord, do not be far from me.*
*You are my strength; come quickly to help me.* 

In the end the world is full of dogs, waiting for the right time to grab all I have left.

*20 Deliver me from the sword,*
*my precious life from the power of the dogs.*
*21 Rescue me from the mouth of the lions;*
*save me from the horns of the wild oxen.*
*22 I will declare your name to my people;*
*in the assembly I will praise you.* 

I am sorry, Lord, please forgive me, for not declaring Your Name in public. In the past even more than in the present, I have despised and betrothed Your Name by not being a good witness and disciple of You. Rather I have hurt people and said and done things worse than Gentiles would do or say.
But You have forgiven me, for my sins in both the past and present it please help me to shout out Your Name in public, the declare Your Name in public and in front of my family and work. Let me show them Your mighty works, what You have done for me.

*23 You who fear the Lord, praise him!*
*All you descendants of Jacob, honor him!*
*Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!*
*24 For he has not despised or scorned*
*the suffering of the afflicted one;*
*he has not hidden his face from him*
*but has listened to his cry for help.* 

The Lord looks upon everyone, even those who are despised in the eyes of the world, when no one cares, God will care. He always listens to our cries.

*25 From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly;*
*before those who fear you[f] I will fulfill my vows.*
*26* **The poor will eat and be satisfied;**
**tho** *se who seek the Lord will praise him—*
*may your hearts live forever!* 

You are the reason I live, and You are the reason why I can be happy at all. All I should be doing is giving You praise all day long, in the presence of everybody.
The poor people will eat. I should be satisfied with food alone, that is all I need.

*27 All the ends of the earth*
*will remember and turn to the Lord,*
*and all the families of the nations*
*will bow down before him,*
*28 for dominion belongs to the Lord*
*and he rules over the nations.* 
Remember, does that mean they, the ends of the world, have always known God dominates the world but just forgotten or ignored Him?

The families of the nations are probably the influential families. If they believe in God, and obey Him, the country is blessed. On the other hand this could also mean the normal people, the common people, with families.

*29 All the rich of the earth will feast and worship;*
*all who go down to the dust will kneel before him—*
*those who cannot keep themselves alive.*
*30 Posterity will serve him;*
*future generations will be told about the Lord.*
*31 They will proclaim his righteousness,*
*declaring to a people yet unborn:*
*He has done it!* 
 
 
Everyone will rejoice for the Lord when hear what He has done for them, for The Lord does only good things and what He considers good is good for all.
The next generation will hear about His good works. Do not be fooled into believing the next generations will not hear about God anymore, that the Bible will fade away, come into nonexistent, that science will conquer. No, God is the creator of science, of mankind and even when there will be no Christian at all anymore, God can speak into man's heart and convert him or whole nations.
