# Psalm 68
*Psalm 68:1-3 NIV*

*May God arise, may his enemies be scattered; may his foes flee before him. May you blow them away like smoke— as wax melts before the fire, may the wicked perish before God. But may the righteous be glad and rejoice before God; may they be happy and joyful.*

Once again, this is what we hope for. Although we want the enemy to flee, there is something we want much more, and that is that our enemies will turn to Christ.

Wax seems hard until it gets near fire. Our enemies and problems seem difficult, until we bring them near God.

*Psalm 68:4-6 NIV*

*Sing to God, sing in praise of his name, extol him who rides on the clouds ; rejoice before him—his name is the Lord .*

Apparently, this line
*extol him who rides on the clouds*
can also mean
*Prepare the way for Him Who rides through the desert.*
To extol would be thus not only mean to lift God up but also to prepare His way.
And indeed this is true, there are two ways of looking at it. Do not just sing and praise, *do* something, prepare something for God. 
Second, a little bit on the contrary, by singing and praising God you are already preparing the way for God.
During a service, by singing we can open the hearts of people, by the power of the Holy Spirit of course, to be more susceptible in receiving God's Word.

*A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling. God sets the lonely in families, he leads out the prisoners with singing; but the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land.*

God is like a father to us and he knows best what will happen when people do not have fathers in their life. Men will become criminals and women try to find confirmation and their identity in other men. This is something a father needs to do.
God commands us to take care of the sick, hungry, thirsty, naked, poor and prisoners. Why specifically these? There are also orphans, couples with no children, handicapped people or mentally disabled people, and widows, mentioned here but not in Matthew 25 below.

*Matthew 25:38-39 NIV*

*When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’*

Perhaps it is because couples with no children can adopt children and orphans may be adopted. Physically and mentally disabled people can function in society with enough care. But the ones who really need care are prisoners, they cannot help themselves and are perhaps most susceptible to the Word of God.
The hungry, thirsty and naked are so poor they cannot even buy food. Amongst these are handicapped or widows as well, I think, and perhaps orphans too. The same for the naked?
The same goes for sick people and strangers, all people how cannot help themselves and need our help.

*Psalm 68:7-10 NIV*

*When you, God, went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness,*

God marched in the wilderness, in the desert, before the people of Israel. He took the danger and risks of walking in front.

*the earth shook, the heavens poured down rain, before God, the One of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel. You gave abundant showers, O God; you refreshed your weary inheritance. Your people settled in it,*

Where we live, where the Israelites lived, that was Your inheritance, You have given that to us and refreshed it. It is not an old place to live, but the best place, because You have given it to us.

*and from your bounty, God, you provided for the poor.*

Does this means that God conquered something and then had bounty from what He conquered and then gave this to His people?

*Psalm 68:11-14 NIV*

*The Lord announces the word, and the women who proclaim it are a mighty throng: “Kings and armies flee in haste; the women at home divide the plunder. Even while you sleep among the sheep pens, the wings of my dove are sheathed with silver, its feathers with shining gold.”*

Are these women who proclaim it the same women as in what is proclaimed? Why are they mighty? Because the men come home with plunder and the women can divide it amongst them?

*When the Almighty scattered the kings in the land, it was like snow fallen on Mount Zalmon.*

Because of the multitude of kings defeated and spread over Mount Zalmon?

*Psalm 68:15-18 NIV*

*Mount Bashan, majestic mountain, Mount Bashan, rugged mountain, why gaze in envy, you rugged mountain, at the mountain where God chooses to reign, where the Lord himself will dwell forever? The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands; the Lord has come from Sinai into his sanctuary.*

Do not be jealous if the Lord chooses someone else to do His work, His greater works.
First, you do not know whether other people's works are as great as yours shall be. Second,...

*When you ascended on high, you took many captives; you received gifts from people, even from the rebellious— that you, Lord God, might dwell there.*

*Psalm 68:19-23 NIV*

*Praise be to the Lord, to God our Savior, who daily bears our burdens.*

I do not know how David knew this, but apparently he did know that Jesus Christ would come and what His purpose was.
He knew that Jesus is or was carrying our burdens.
But what about now? Would He still be carrying our burdens? Would He still have the scars on His body, His palms and side?

*Our God is a God who saves; from the Sovereign Lord comes escape from death. Surely God will crush the heads of his enemies, the hairy crowns of those who go on in their sins. The Lord says, “I will bring them from Bashan; I will bring them from the depths of the sea, that your feet may wade in the blood of your foes, while the tongues of your dogs have their share.”*

It seems like this verse tells us that God will not only save us but also take revenge on our enemies and let us enjoy it. It seems strange to me that God would do something like that.

*Psalm 68:24-27 NIV*

*Your procession, God, has come into view, the procession of my God and King into the sanctuary. In front are the singers, after them the musicians; with them are the young women playing the timbrels. Praise God in the great congregation; praise the Lord in the assembly of Israel. There is the little tribe of Benjamin, leading them, there the great throng of Judah’s princes, and there the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali.*

Why exactly these tribes?

*Psalm 68:28-31 NIV*

*Summon your power, God ; show us your strength, our God, as you have done before. Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings will bring you gifts. Rebuke the beast among the reeds, the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations. Humbled, may the beast bring bars of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in war. Envoys will come from Egypt; Cush will submit herself to God.*

Right now, Lord, I want to ask You the same thing again. Rebuke Egypt, but also Palestine and Syria and the whole world who is against You and Your people.
Save Your people from all accusations. Save us, Your children, as well from all the attacks we suffer in so many a country, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Laos and especially North Korea.

*Psalm 68:32-35 NIV*

*Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth, sing praise to the Lord, to him who rides across the highest heavens, the ancient heavens, who thunders with mighty voice.*

All kingdoms, all countries have to sing praise to the Lord. They do not understand how mighty God is, how God has helped each country to where it is right now. If it were not for God, the devil would have destroyed all countries all along. There would not even be humans on the planet anymore, for everyone who does not follow God would end up in hell.

*Proclaim the power of God, whose majesty is over Israel, whose power is in the heavens. You, God, are awesome in your sanctuary; the God of Israel gives power and strength to his people. Praise be to God!*

God shows His might by the majesty seen that is over Israel and its people. As long as they obey the Lord, He will remember them and save them.
This is seen right now in the war between Palestine and Israel. There are some casualties in Israel, but most are on Palestinian side. I think that is because God protects Israel and His children, and because Israel has no blame in this except for rightful revenge.

***Important learning points of this Psalm***. 
Why is God so merciful towards prisoners? What is meant with Mount Zalmon, and Basham?
What is the meaning God's dove? Still unknown, but Spurgeon explains this in his commentaries.

**Verse 13.** *Though ye have lien among the pots.* Does he mean that the women at home, who had been meanly clad as they performed their household work, would be so gorgeously arrayed in the spoil, that they would be like doves of silver wing and golden plumage? Or, would he say that Israel, which had been begrimed in the brick kilns of Egypt, should come forth lustrous and happy in triumph and liberty? Or, did the song signify that the ark should be brought from its poor abode with Obededom into a fairer dwelling place? It is a hard passage, a nut for the learned to crack. If we knew all that was known when this ancient hymn was composed, the allusion would no doubt strike us as being beautifully appropriate, but as we do not, we will let it rest among the unriddled things. Alexander reads it, "When ye shall lie down between the borders, ye shall be like the wings, "etc., which he considers to mean, "when settled in peace, the land shall enjoy prosperity; "but this version does not seem to us any more clear than our authorized one. Of making many conjectures there is no end; but the sense seems to be, that from the lowest condition the Lord would lift up his people into joy, liberty, wealth, and beauty.
