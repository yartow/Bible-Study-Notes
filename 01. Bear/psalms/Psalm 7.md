# Psalm 7
About Cush the Benjamite (no information about him in the Bible)

*Psalm 7:1-5 NIV* 

*Lord my God, I take refuge in you; save and deliver me from all who pursue me, or they will tear me apart like a lion and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me. Lord my God, if I have done this and there is guilt on my hands— if I have repaid my ally with evil or without cause have robbed my foe— then let my enemy pursue and overtake me; let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust.* 

Lord, my God, You are the only place I can hide at. Please save me and deliver me from all seductions, distractions from the work in Your Kingdom, help me to know how to walk Your way when I am serving in Your Church. Help me to maintain relationships with everyone, my brothers and sisters in my congregation, to be submissive to the authority You have given to the Commission and the church council. Please help me to know what to do if the Sunday School and all of Youth Ministry will be under the supervision of the Commission.
Even though they are not my enemies and have no bad will like Cush, I still make this comparison.
But if I have done something bad, let me suffer for it. Perhaps even, let me suffer during my ministry in the congregation.

Lord, I really do not know what to do anymore. I really do not want to work together with the Commission, not under their supervision, not with their planning, not with their slow pace in communication and organization, not with their fear of moving forward too fast or finding my ideas too radical.

*Arise, Lord, in your anger; rise up against the rage of my enemies. Awake, my God; decree justice. Let the assembled peoples gather around you, while you sit enthroned over them on high.* **Let the Lord judge the peoples.**

That means that not I shall judge others. Forgive me if I so so, Lord.

*Vindicate me, Lord, according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High. Bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure— you, the righteous God who probes minds and hearts. (Psalm 7:6-9 NIV)*

It takes a lot of courage to say to the Lord to vindicate oneself *according* to ones righteousness, unless one knows he is very righteous. I would not dare to say so, because I know I am more wrong and more sinful than most if not all of my adversaries. 
The next line is to make the righteous secure. There I am glad to know that I am secure, because I have been made righteous by Jesus Christ. However, it does say that God probes the heart and minds, of both us as well as of our enemies. This probably means that it is only one possibility that God speaks into the heart of your enemy to tell him he should not harass you anymore; another possibility is that God speaks into your heart and gives you peace and courage and wisdom to understand, but the harassment continues.

*Psalm 7:10-13 NIV*

*My shield is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart. God is a righteous judge, a God who displays his wrath every day. If he does not relent, he will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow. He has prepared his deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows.*

God chooses a side, no decision He makes is halfway, neither is His punishment. This goes for me too. I have noticed many times in my life that I have not been punished for my sins. God had not shot His arrows at me nor did He punish me in a lighter way, instead He just withheld His punishment, He relented. Thank the Lord for that.
I still do not understand why He sometimes relents. I am not sure if it would have helped me to stop my sin sooner if I had been punished more often, but I think it would have. In the end, God knows what is best for anyone at any moment in time.

*Psalm 7:14-17 NIV*

*Whoever is pregnant with evil conceives trouble and gives birth to disillusionment. Whoever digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit they have made. The trouble they cause recoils on them; their violence comes down on their own heads.*

I have to be careful with all of my ideas and make sure they really not evil. They need to be building up people and not destroying people. I need to know that all the bad things will come back at me.

*I will give thanks to the Lord because of his righteousness; I will sing the praises of the name of the Lord Most High.*

Whatever happens, I know it is God's righteousness that has taken place and I have to praise Him for this. Even if I do not like the outcome.
