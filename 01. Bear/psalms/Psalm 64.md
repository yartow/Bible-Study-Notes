# Psalm 64
*Psalm 64:1 NIV*

*Hear me, my God, as I voice my complaint;*
Father, I need You to hear me. I really do not know what to do. What is right and what not?

*protect my life from the threat of the enemy.*

Please protect Your Church and Your people from the enemy, protect me from getting the wrong ideas about what is good or wrong.

*Psalm 64:2-4 NIV*

*Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the plots of evildoers.*

So many powers are surrounding me to withhold me from doing the work You want me to do. Even Christians are withholding me without them knowing about it.

*They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim cruel words like deadly arrows. They shoot from ambush at the innocent; they shoot suddenly, without fear.*

Without knowing I have been one of those people withholding other Christians as well. I have sharpened my tongue and used it in wrong ways. Against my wife and my surroundings. Cruel words and words without love.
Not protecting words or words to build up, but words breaking others down.

Help me, Lord, to control my tongue. To say nothing when I cannot praise You with my mouth and to speak only when I have love in my words.

*Psalm 64:5-6 NIV*

*They encourage each other in evil plans, they talk about hiding their snares; they say, “Who will see it ?” They plot injustice and say, “We have devised a perfect plan!” Surely the human mind and heart are cunning.*

And just like the previous verse was nog meant for others but for me, so this verse is as well.

How can I accept the fact that I have used my talent, the talent God gave me, to plan cunningly, evil plans for unjust purposes, selfish purposes, hurting not only others but God foremost.
Forgive me, Lord, for I have sinned, even more than I thought, and longer and in more fields than I could ever imagine.

*Psalm 64:7-9 NIV*

*But God will shoot them with his arrows; they will suddenly be struck down. He will turn their own tongues against them and bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.*

When God strikes you it is indeed as if an arrow has struck you. It hurts, but it does not kill you (directly). You cannot pull it out, and every movement you make hurts all other parts in your body.
It happened to me. I did not control my tongue, and directly or shortly after it backfired. People did not trust me anymore, I got a bad reputation, they did not want my help.

*All people will fear; they will proclaim the works of God and ponder what he has done.*

If only they knew that it was God Who did all of this. Then the people would fear and know that I have changed only because of God, because He changed my heart.

*Psalm 64:10 NIV*

*The righteous will rejoice in the Lord and take refuge in him; all the upright in heart will glory in him!*

I understand this first verse as: the righteous will be joyful, no matter what circumstances surround them. For they are not *in* a certain circumstance, but in the Lord. 
The upright in heart, are the same righteous people, for it is not possible to be upright and not righteous, is it?
They will glory God. Not actively perse, but by merely being upright, other people will see they are different from the world. Even if people do not see the uprightness of the righteous, they would surely see if they were not upright.
