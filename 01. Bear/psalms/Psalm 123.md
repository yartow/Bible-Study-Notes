# Psalm 123
*http://bible.com/111/psa.123.1-4.niv*
*I lift up my eyes to you, to you who sit enthroned in heaven.*
*As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a female slave look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God, till he shows us his mercy.*

Show us mercy, Lord. You have shown us so much mercy already in this past summer conference, more than I could have imagined. The weather, the class, and the fun the children had. I pray to You that they may know you and remember what they have learned and memorized about You.
I ask for more mercy for if You give it to me to set up a children's ministry more than tenfold the size of the current one.

*Have mercy on us, Lord , have mercy on us, for we have endured no end of contempt.*

I really want this for the children and I do not care if my name is known. I do ask for Your authority to make this happen, I do not say this because eigen contempt for the current leaders, but only because I wish to make it better.

*We have endured no end of ridicule from the arrogant, of contempt from the proud.*

I know I cannot do it without you, that is where I have no arrogance, I know I cannot make them enthusiastic without You or let Your Word reach their hearts.
