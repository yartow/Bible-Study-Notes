# Psalm 59
*Psalm 59:1-5 NIV*

*Deliver me from my enemies, O God; be my fortress against those who are attacking me. Deliver me from evildoers and save me from those who are after my blood.*

Father, there are more powers attacking me than I know of and I know I need prayer. Please help me know that I must never rely on my instinct, because my instinct cannot detect the devil, for I am sinful myself and my flesh longs to sin.
Fill me with your Spirit and let me know what is wrong in my mind, my eyes and my heart.

**See how they lie in wait for me! Fierce men conspire against me for no offense or sin of mine, Lord . I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me. Arise to help me; look on my plight! You, Lord God Almighty, you who are the God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to wicked traitors.**

David can ask for help, Lord, but can I too? David has done no wrong to people, but I have.
I have sinned not only to people, but to you as well.
I know You know my heart is at the right place now, and that You have forgiven me my sins. But will you protect me from attackers from the past, who have not forgiven me and are still after me?

*Psalm 59:6-10 NIV*

*They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city. See what they spew from their mouths— the words from their lips are sharp as swords, and they think, “Who can hear us?”*
*But you laugh at them, Lord ; you scoff at all those nations.*

People are foolish, and often I am too. They think You cannot see or hear them, and so do I sometimes.
Forgive me, Lord. Let them know You *are* able to watch their every move and know their every thought. Let them fear You like everyone should, and know You are God. 

Yet I know it is true that their words are sharp, for they van convince almost anyone into believing that You do not hear people, that You are unrighteous, even though people do not realize it is You Who has defined righteousness.

*You are my strength, I watch for you; you, God, are my fortress, my God on whom I can rely. God will go before me and will let me gloat over those who slander me.*

Teach me, O Lord, to watch for You. How can I know You are my fortress, how can I use that fact? Is it only by experiencing an attack? Perhaps it is.

*Psalm 59:11-13 NIV*

*But do not kill them, Lord our shield, or my people will forget.*

David asks here that God does not kill the people who have treated him on badly. Does he ask the same for all the people attacking him in all of the other Psalms?
What is true is that he asks this not for himself but for either God's glory, because the wicked people indirectly are insulting God when they insult David, or he asks it for the good of his people, in order for them to learn.
Two things can be learned from this, that I should get my priorities correctly, God first, and others before me, and secondly, that automatically means I do not always get what I want because there are other more important things.

*In your might uproot them and bring them down. For the sins of their mouths, for the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride. For the curses and lies they utter, consume them in your wrath, consume them till they are no more. Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob.*

On the other hand, David wants God to punish them so that the world may know God. First of all know that God exists and that He is mightier than we can all imagine. Second of all, he asks this so that God's righteousness may be visible as well, that is that the wicked shall be punished and the righteous be rescued.

*Psalm 59:14-17 NIV*

*They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city. They wander about for food and howl if not satisfied. But I will sing of your strength, in the morning I will sing of your love; for you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble. You are my strength, I sing praise to you; you, God, are my fortress, my God on whom I can rely.*

David sees the wicked people like dogs. He is not talking about foreigners here, but about his own people. Calling them dogs perhaps means that his own people are no better than the unbelievers.
It can also be interpreted as dogs being creatures who do everything instinctively, without thinking, only looking for food and biting is something is in their way.
Of course this is a lot of speculation, but perhaps David means that the people he is talking about are in the same way as dogs "innocent", they never have for example, heard of the Lord in the same way that normal families do.

What does *till they are no more* mean?
