# Psalm 63
*Psalm 63:1 NIV*

*You, God, are my God, earnestly I seek you; I thirst for you, my whole being longs for you, in a dry and parched land where there is no water.*

My whole being is every part of my body and my life. There is nothing I can do without You. In my job I need to be blessed by You, to be fruitful and bring results.
In my relationship I need Your wisdom to know what to say and what not.
In my daily life I need Your strength all the time, to make the right choices, in saving money, and constraining my temper amongst others.

It is as if I am in a dry land and You are the only water. Though this world does not seem like a dry land, with books enough of "knowledge" and people of "wisdom", but none of the wisdoms can compare to the richness of You. Better yet, all of these so-called wisdoms are like water that does not quench thirst, and even worse, it makes one think his thirst is quenched. One stops drinking and eventually dies of draught.

Thank You, Lord, that I may know the truth and the true water that gives life.

*Psalm 63:2-5 NIV*

*I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory. Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.*

My lips will glorify whatever is good. And You are the best, Your love is the best thing there is on Earth, no, in the whole world.

*I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands.*

With my hands as well will I praise You, even with my whole body. I will make myself pure, for I do not want to use unclean lips to glorify you or sing to You. I do not want unclean hands being lifted up to You.

*I will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods; with singing lips my mouth will praise you.*

Why is there a line about foods? Foods gives one of the greatest satisfactions in life.

*Psalm 63:6-8 NIV*

*On my bed I remember you; I think of you through the watches of the night. Because you are my help, I sing in the shadow of your wings.*

It does not matter where we are even in the darkest places, in the latest or earliest hours, You are there to protect us. We may sing to You and call for help anytime, and without knowing perhaps, You have always been watching *over* us, for we were *under* Your wings. 

*I cling to you; your right hand upholds me.*

As a child clinging to its father's legs, wrapping it's arms and legs around his legs, that is how I imagine this verse. It moves along wherever the father goes, it gives a feeling of protection, because the child is near the father and it gives rest, for the child does not have to walk himself.

*Psalm 63:9-11 NIV*

*Those who want to kill me will be destroyed; they will go down to the depths of the earth. They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.*

Suddenly, from hiding in the shadow of God's wings, David starts speaking of people who want to kill him. Of course this has literally happened. People did want to kill him, his own son probably wanted to do that as well.
Probably David was so much into praising God that He forgot about his own problems. He saw God's greatness and glory in the sanctuary, which made him and his problems seem so small.
God will make my problems seem small. In the light of God's awesome power my problems are solvable by just a flick of God's fingers. He does not even have to stretch out His hand, just a thought and the Satan will leave me and stop harassing me.

*But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by God will glory in him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced.*

Swearing by God is of course never allowed, by if we were to do that we would be really sure that we are telling the truth, before saying something like that.
Liars could never say something like that, if they were to swear by God, God would punish them severely if they lied.
