# Psalm 70 (NIV)
*Psalm 70:1 NIV*

*Hasten, O God, to save me; come quickly, Lord , to help me.*

Do not take things slowly when you need get. Get help as soon as possible, do not let the devil tempt you one second longer.
So not worry one second longer when God can take your troubles away.
Help me, Lord, for I need Your help with our finances. Not that I am worried, but I am afraid that I could give the wrong example of how to use the money you have asked me to take care of.

*Psalm 70:2-4 NIV*

*May those who want to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace. May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” turn back because of their shame. But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who long for your saving help always say, “The Lord is great!”*

I ask You, Lord, to be merciful to those who see You. May you make them rejoice in any circumstance and let them be glad in You, glad in everything You have done for them.

I wish that everyone who knows You will tell the world that You are great. Even when they are longing for Your help, which means they have not received it yet.

*Psalm 70:5 NIV*

*But as for me, I am poor and needy; come quickly to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; Lord , do not delay.*

Once again, I need to admit I am poor and needy, in this case literally. I am sorry, Lord, for being so proud that I did not ask You for help earlier. I thought I could handle all of my finances myself, and that I could pay my debts on my own power, by just needing a little bit of time. But now I realize that it is only getting worse and the foreseeable future is one in which I financially cannot survive if my wife does not have a job.
I know she needs rest and therefore I do not want her to work, but I cannot take care of my family on my own. I need Your help, Lord!

David says You are his help and deliverer, please deliver me as well.
