# Psalm 102
#### A prayer of an afflicted person who has grown weak and pours out a lament before the Lord.

*1 Hear my prayer, Lord;*
*let my cry for help come to you.*
*2 Do not hide your face from me*
*when I am in distress.*
*Turn your ear to me;*
*when I call, answer me quickly.*
I have to remember this verse for when I grow weak. Do not forget the Lord. Do not forget that the Lord is the One Who will listen to me. Ask Him to show His face and not to turn His back to me.
*3 For my days vanish like smoke;*
*my bones burn like glowing embers.*
*4 My heart is blighted and withered like grass;*
*I forget to eat my food.*
In those days of distress my days vanish like smoke, I feel like I have done nothing, learned nothing and not given anything to anyone that day.
I don't know the feeling about the bones burning like embers yet, perhaps that is of age, but I do know that a bad mood can destroy the body.
*5 In my distress I groan aloud*
**and am reduced to skin and bones.**

What can skin and bones do? Nothing, they have no strength, they cannot lift anything, they can only feel, they are alive, they can think, but nothing more.
In those days I feel helpless and no matter how deep I think within me, I cannot help myself. There is no inner power. The power has to come from outside.
Only God's power can save me.

*6 I am like a desert owl,*
*like an owl among the ruins.*
*7 I lie awake; I have become*
*like a bird alone on a roof.*
A desert owl is all alone, only keeping himself alive. He has no companions, no one who understands how he feels.

*8 All day long my enemies taunt me;*
*those who rail against me use my name as a curse.*
*9 For I eat ashes as my food*
*and mingle my drink with tears*
*10 because of your great wrath,*
*for you have taken me up and thrown me aside.*

If You throw me aside, Lord, I really have no one left anymore. My enemies will even laugh harder at me because now their enemy's strength has left him. Do not give them this power, do not let them boast of their own strength, for their strength too will go away.

*11 My days are like the evening shadow;*
*I wither away like grass.*

The evening shadow does not really disappear, but mingle in with all of the other shadows. It is not visible anymore, because it gets so dark. No one can see it anymore.
Grass too, no one cares about the individual blade of grass, no one sees it withering, no one sees new grass growing back.

*Psalm 102:12-17 NIV*

*But you, Lord , sit enthroned forever; your renown endures through all generations.*

It does not matter whether I am withering away, what matters is that You sit enthroned. You will always be there, I will only be on Earth for a little while. You are ruler over all the Earth, I am but a mere servant.

*You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her; the appointed time has come.*

Until now it seemed like You have abandoned Zion, even though I do not think so. Perhaps, if David is the author of this Psalm, he is referring to what had happened recently, how Your Kingdom fell apart and got torn up by the desire of his sons for power.
But now You will come, I know, even at the moment of writing this I see that You have been with Zion, and Israel, all the time. Even though the whole world is against them, You are on their side, Israel has minimal casualties, Israel did not start the war.

*For her stones are dear to your servants; her very dust moves them to pity.*

The reason we ask for Your salvation is because we care about Zion. It takes something we care about to be attacked or destroyed before we take any action. That shows our selfishness.
At the same time, that is what God can use to move us.

*The nations will fear the name of the Lord , all the kings of the earth will revere your glory. For the Lord will rebuild Zion and appear in his glory.*

I have to know that eventually all kings will revere God's Name. The kings of the nations right now think they own their own lives, but that is just because they do not know God yet.
They do not know that God will appear in His glory before them.

**He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their plea.**

I do not have to be ashamed of what I want to ask God. If I am destitute, needy and in want, He will give it to me if it can glorify Him.

*Psalm 102:18-22 NIV*

*Let this be written for a future generation, that a people not yet created may praise the Lord : “The Lord looked down from his sanctuary on high, from heaven he viewed the earth, to hear the groans of the prisoners and release those condemned to death.”*

God's purpose is to have a long lasting relationship with us and our children, and their children. He wants us to praise Him, and He wants our children to know that He is looking at us from heaven and that He hears us.

*So the name of the Lord will be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the Lord .*

You want to buy have a relationship with us. It is not Your purpose to let us praise You, but merely to know You, for You know that we will praise You and worship You in awe naturally when we see Your face and know Your Name.

To worship You means to do everything *for You* that is possible. It means that when we think, we use godly thoughts and when we judge, we use godly judgements. We do not act on our own, but by inspiration and command of You, and do things not by our own power but by Yours.

God, You also want the nations to assemble, that means that You want us to be on the same side. Though we exist of different nations, we can all work together, we praise You together and together Sr can fight against the Satan.

*Psalm 102:23-28 NIV*

*In the course of my life he broke my strength; he cut short my days. So I said: “Do not take me away, my God, in the midst of my days; your years go on through all generations.*

詩篇 102:23-24 CUNP

他使我的力量中道衰弱， 使我的年日短少。 我說：我的上帝啊， 不要使我中年去世。 你的年數世世無窮！

The NIV translation says this verse can also be interpreted as *by His power He broke my strength*. I do not see how, so I looked up the Chinese translation which in some cases (quite often actually) is closer to the Hebrew version. I still do not understand how the NIV has come to such an interpretation.

My interpretation of this verse is that the author wants to live longer. The intricate desire of human beings is to live. We want to survive. Even people who commit suicide want to live, they just cannot find a way to do that peacefully and do not have the strength to do it.
Blessed is the man who calls out, who *cries* out, to You and wants to live, for he wants to enjoy a life with You in it and He is depending on You for strength.

Blessed is the man who obtains a longer life with You.
I myself am tired too. Tired of this world, secularism and sins everywhere, even in the Christian world, influencing the children of God. The world keeps pushing us to chase its most valuable things, money and time, working too much to make money, and then using the money to get better holidays to relax more from all of the working.

Lord God, I need strength from You. I need to put my hope in You.

*In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded. But you remain the same, and your years will never end.*

The world changes in all of its ways, some problems of people change as well, but it is always the same God that we can put our hope in. It is the same God Who will solve our problems and Who rules it all. It is the same One Who will always win, because He created the universe.

*The children of your servants will live in your presence; their descendants will be established before you.”*

My children will live in Your presence, because You are with me. If I keep them close to me, they will be close to You as well. Whether it is the descendants to me or of my children, they will all be established, built up in Christ, before You, that is You will *see* it, because You will always be there.

Zion is Israel or Jerusalem?
