# Psalm 119 Part 3
*http://bible.com/111/psa.119.104-106.niv*
*I gain understanding from your precepts; therefore I hate every wrong path.*

I truly hate the wrong paths, Lord. I have walked on them so often and every time they have led me to sin or to the path of a bigger sin.
Those sins have destroyed my life, my reputation, and have even cost me a lot of money and effort, and perhaps even friends.

*Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.*
*#keyverse*

This verse is so familiar for me right now that I almost skipped it. That is the danger of key verses.
Your Word has always been the light with which I could see. I have not realized it until now, but without light I cannot see, and without Your Word I cannot know what is right and wrong.
You also show me the direction I should walk. Little by little You have shown me what life is about and what is important to You. But I could only find out as soon as I took that one step into Your direction, in order to know the next one.

*I have taken an oath and confirmed it, that I will follow your righteous laws.*

My oath, my *promise* actually - because we are not allowed to swear - was to give my life to You. That includes all of the rules I obey, they become Yours. 

**http://bible.com/111/psa.119.107-112.niv**
*I have suffered much; preserve my life, Lord , according to your word.*

I have suffered, but not merely as much as You have, even when You were on Earth. And where I have suffered from my own sins, You have suffered, even while You were living in from the sins of others, who hurt You, mocked You and laughed at You.

*Accept, Lord , the willing praise of my mouth, and teach me your laws.*

I know my mouth is unclean but I ask You to accept my praises. Teach me Your laws even though I can never teach them to others perfectly.

*Though I constantly take my life in my hands, I will not forget your law.*

*#question* Perhaps David means he is often disobeying You and making his own decisions, or it means he is taking risks such that even his life is at stake.
Either way, I too will not forget Your law. Even though I often sin, I ask You for forgiveness and I ask You to help me sin no more.

*The wicked have set a snare for me, but I have not strayed from your precepts.*

He wicked have been chasing me all of my life and they probably will do so the rest of my life. I pray to You for Your strength to keep standing firm and stay in Your Word.

*Your statutes are my heritage forever; they are the joy of my heart.*

Your statutes are the only thing I have. And I know there is love in them and the fruit of the Spirit. I can grow and draw near to You when I keep Your statutes, but thank You that even if I do not hold Your statutes, You still draw me near.

**M** **y** *heart is set on keeping your decrees to the very end.*

My heart is set on it, and even though I do not always show it with my mind or body, I want to obey You. Let it be with my full heart, Father, that I want to obey You. Let there be nothing hidden in my heart that keeps me from knowing You better.

**http://bible.com/111/psa.119.113-117.niv I hate double-minded people, but I love your law.**

Double minded people are those who sometimes think of sin in a right way and at other times in a wrong way. I hint they will come across in a very hypocritical way.
I know what is wrong and yet my flesh desires that, and at the same time my heart desires to do the right thing.

*You are my refuge and my shield; I have put my hope in your word.*

Only You can protect me, evil and his temptation are attacking me from all sides, but Your shield is surrounding me from all sides. I have put my hope in Your Word, which means that I know that only Your Word can save me.
It is unfortunate that I take it as a "last resort", when I am more than thirty years of age already. I know that I can fully depend on it, it will give me all the wisdom and strength I need, it will feed my soul.

*Away from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commands of my God!*

I must stay away from those who sin in order that I will not sin too.

*Sustain me, my God, according to your promise, and I will live; do not let my hopes be dashed.*

Yes, only if You sustain me can I live. Not just physically, even though that is probably true as well (I believe that every second is granted to us by grace, every day that I live in health, do not have cancer, seeing all the cancerous food we are eating, is given by you, and not thanks to the Satan, for he would probably have us dead right away), but also mentally and spiritually.
I have hope that I can catch my train and arrive at work, I have peace when I wake up, that this will not be my last day, and when I eat that it will not be my last meal (whether on Earth or in heaven).
Without hope I cannot live.

*Uphold me, and I will be delivered; I will always have regard for your decrees.*

You uphold me, You have done so and therefore
I am saved. I am afraid that in the future I might forget about Your decrees, I might fall off the right path, but You will bring me back, and I will never have disregard for Your decrees.

*http://bible.com/111/psa.119.118-122.niv*
*You reject all who stray from your decrees, for their delusions come to nothing.*

Of course I have strayed from Your decrees, but You have not rejected me. Surely that is due to Your forgiving character, but perhaps also because of the meaning of *stray* in this verse.
I think straying in this sense means slowly drifting away, further and further, whereas I sinned, repented and came back to You.

*A* **ll** *the wicked of the earth you discard like dross; therefore I love your statutes.*

Your statutes are clear about who needs to be punished. You are not afraid to discard those who do not want to be saved.
Lord help me to have hope on Your plan, to know that there is hope for the people of IS and Boko Haram and that that is the reason You have not annihilated them. Just like many people could testify of You after the Second World War.

*My flesh trembles in fear of you; I stand in awe of your laws.*

You are the only one I fear, because I know You can do more than kill my flesh. Fortunately I know You want me to be on Your side. And fortunately You have given me precepts which I can keep, which I can follow to know which path is the right one.

*http://bible.com/111/psa.119.121-124.niv*
*I have done what is righteous and just; do not leave me to my oppressors.*

Even though in some situations I know it seems hopeless to the world if I choose Your path. Hopeless to the point that I think *how can I give glory to You in this way?* But I know You will not leave me. Just like Jesus died on the cross and the people thought that God did not even save His own Son. 

*Ensure your servant’s well-being; do not let the arrogant oppress me.*

That is why I ask You not to leave me to my oppressors. Show them that You are mighty and even if I may be a fool to them, show them that You are not.

*My eyes fail, looking for your salvation, looking for your righteous promise.*

My human eyes indeed cannot see where there is salvation in some of Your plans. Perhaps I cannot even see where the promise is.
I know You, or at least I think I know You, well enough to know what You have promised me.

*Deal with your servant according to your love and teach me your decrees.*

Deal with me, because I have sinned, but deal with me according to Your love. Let me learn from how gracious You are and be gracious to others as well.

*http://bible.com/111/psa.119.125-128.niv*
*I am your servant; give me discernment that I may understand your statutes.*

Understanding Your statutes is a difficult thing, understanding the thought behind it as well as the interpretation and practice.

*It is time for you to act, Lord ; your law is being broken.*

At this very moment Your Law is being broken all around the world. There is not a sole place where people are upholding Your Law. If things are as good as they sound in Rwanda, then perhaps that will be Your next people, from where Your Word and goodness will spread as a testimony and light to all people. And then it will be clear why the genocide has taken place. Because You have a purpose for everything.

*Because I love your commands more than gold, more than pure gold, and because I consider all your precepts right, I hate every wrong path.*

It cannot be that I love sin and Your Law both at the same time, either I am lying when I say I hate sin, or it is true that I really love Your statutes.
Then why do I so often sin if I hate it? Why do I not listen to Your Word if I love that?
My flesh is not obeying my soul. I have not trained my flesh enough

**http://bible.com/111/psa.119.129-133.niv**
*Your statutes are wonderful; therefore I obey them.*

Your statutes are full of wonders. If I do more than simply obeying them, but love them as well and treat them with respect, I will see the true wonders herein.
Those who have found wonders in Your Law such as a cure for all Sexual Transmitted Diseases by being faithful to one's spouse, have found arguments as such through the love for Your Law.

*The unfolding of your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.*

And in this way Your Law, which seems incomprehensible for the simple, become understandable, while it defeats criticisms as well *,* even on scientific fields. 

*I open my mouth and pant, longing for your commands.*

Whenever I open my mouth to speak of You, it is to protect Your Word. Everything, and not *nearly* everything, just be according to Your Word. For everything I say or think must be according to Your precepts and true. 

*Turn to me and have mercy on me, as you always do to those who love your name.*

You have already had mercy on me, all through my life I have seen Your merciful hand guiding me and leading me in a soft way.
You placed me in a merciful environment, without poverty and bullies, in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, where there is freedom if religion. What more can I ask for?
Even before I called you, You had already done that. But I call on You once again to ask for Your mercy in the time to come. In every field, financial, and my career, both within and outside of the church.

*Direct my footsteps according to your word; let no sin rule over me.*

But one thing I ask of You, and that is to direct my footsteps according to Your Word. Let no sin rule over me, let none of my steps or decisions be influenced by sin. Let them be purely inspired by Your wisdom.

**http://bible.com/111/psa.119.134-139.niv**
*Redeem me from human oppression, that I may obey your precepts.*

Being around worldly humans all the time I feel forced sometimes to disobey Your precepts. That is why I ask You to redeem me from human oppression.

*Make your face shine on your servant and teach me your decrees.*

A student cannot become great like his teacher if the teacher's face does not shine upon Him. In order for me to learn, Your face face needs to shine on me.

*Streams of tears flow from my eyes, for your law is not obeyed.*

It hurts me to see that so many people willingly disobey Your Law, in the worst cases they do not even know what Your Law is. It seems to be work without an end, to teach this world for one *sex after marriage*. 

*You are righteous, Lord , and your laws are right.*

Your Law is always right and it is righteous as well. It is not for nothing that You have said to stick this Law to our foreheads and on our doors.

**T** **he** *statutes you have laid down are righteous; they are fully trustworthy.*

There is nothing in Your statutes that I cannot trust. If there is, then it is I who have a problem and need to change, not Your statutes.

*My zeal wears me out, for my enemies ignore your words.*

Not just my enemies, but my fellow church members as well. I am chasing them like I am chasing children to do something they do not want to do. It seems impossible to convince them, but in all this I am forgetting that You need to convince them, not I.
Help me to motivate my brothers and sisters to obey You, Lord, and devote themselves to You.
Help me to motivate my students as well to believe in You and therefore do their best to know You.

It really wears me out and I know I can only do this with your strength. Perhaps I am not made to lead the children. Let me know my purpose, Lord, and use me as You want.

**http://bible.com/111/psa.119.140-144.niv**
*Your promises have been thoroughly tested, and your servant loves them.*

The devil has attempted many times to make sure that Your promise would not be fulfilled. He did not succeed, he should know better, because there is nothing that can keep You away from being faithful. You *are* faithfulness itself! Even by definition You have already kept Your promise *.*

*Though I am lowly and despised, I do not forget your precepts.*

I do not gain much respect from some, but that is not important. What is important is that You get respect. All I need to do as Your humbly servant is to follow Your precepts.

*Your righteousness is everlasting and your law is true.*

As far as I can see in the future, Your righteousness always rules. The one at fault will be punished and the righteous one will be rewarded. Even science fiction movies write about that.

*Trouble and distress have come upon me, but your commands give me delight.*

Your commands are the only thing that can keep my mind clear, because they are stable. They give me peace, because they do not change.
My troubles disappear when I think of Your greatness, and the vast amount of possibilities there are as solutions. Each of those possible solutions You can choose to implement, or many others which I cannot see. The probability that I cannot be rescued from my situation is zero.
Furthermore, Your commands give me delight. Not only because there is a situation, but also because there is an absolute truth. There is not ethical question as to what is right or wrong, You are right and what You wrote is right.
Having this knowledge stops the debating and philosophizing in my mind and heart.

*Your statutes are always righteous; give me understanding that I may live.*

Understanding Your statutes and knowing them are two different things. I need to understand that Your statutes are righteous. They are not just perfectly written, without loopholes, but perfectly honest as well, though for some they might seem discriminating.

*http://bible.com/111/psa.119.145-148.niv*
*I call with all my heart; answer me, Lord , and I will obey your decrees.*

Give me strength, Lord, to obey *all* of Your decrees. I hear You calling and I know what to do, but I still need Your strength to obey it and actually do it.
Let sin not take the time upper hand.

*I call out to you; save me and I will keep your statutes.*

I know I have been saved, but I need to be saved every day, saved from the temptation within. Only after being able to resist it, I can keep Your statutes.

**I** *rise before dawn and cry for help; I have put my hope in your word. My eyes stay open through the watches of the night, that I may meditate on your promises.*

I have not done what David does, I have not woken up before dawn, on a Saturday I cannot even wake at eight o'clock. Nor can I stay awake at night to meditate on Your Word. But I ask You to turn what I cannot do into something I can do.
Teach me discipline to wake up and sleep when You want me to, to finish what I have to do. Especially to focus on Your Word.
Help me to not be distracted from reading or meditating on Your Word by interesting news for example.

*http://bible.com/111/psa.119.149-154.niv Hear my voice in accordance with your love; preserve my life, Lord , according to your laws.*

You do not have to listen to my voice, for I am not worth Your time. But Your love is so great You still take the time to listen to me. To listen to my apologies, even though I think they sound like lame excuses to You.
Help me to be understanding like You are, Lord Jesus. You have been here on Earth and experienced everything. You know how hard it is and You have withstood every temptation to get angry for the wrong reasons, to get jealous, to have lust for something. And still You do not look down on us.

*Those who devise wicked schemes are near, but they are far from your law. Yet you are near, Lord , and all your commands are true.*

I like the poetic aspect of this verse. The wicked are physically near me, but figuratively they are far from Your Law. You are near me, but far from the wicked.
This means that even when bad things happen near me, it does not mean that You are far from me, as long as I stay near Your Law.

*Long ago I learned from your statutes that you established them to last forever.*

I have known this indeed ever since I was young. You are going to be God forever, You will be the God of my children and grandchildren as well.

*Look on my suffering and deliver me, for I have not forgotten your law.*

During my high school period, where I have - according to my standards - not forgotten Your Law, I know that You have delivered me. I could have been bullied, either because of my peculiar character, my ethnicity or my belief in You, but You let me grow up as a healthy child.
You even let me know You better and touched me. It is thanks to You, all of Your efforts, that I am saved. And all before I gave my life to You.
But later on, after I converted, I started disobeying You and it is in that period that I had left Your presence as well. How much more so would I have grown if I had just listened to You?!
Please help me to help my son not go through the same things I did. Protect my son, Father, and give me wisdom to know how.

*Defend my cause and redeem me; preserve my life according to your promise.*

I cannot say I am innocent, in court I would lose, even if You are the judge. That is why I need Your Holy Spirit to be my Counselor, my advocate. I ask You to defend my cause and redeem me, even though You know I have been in the wrong, You know I regret my mistakes and I am willing to give my life for You.
You have promised to preserve my life, as far as it is valid according to Your promise, preserve me, Lord.

*http://bible.com/111/psa.119.149-159.niv*
*Hear my voice in accordance with your love; preserve my life, Lord , according to your* ***laws*** *.*
*Defend my cause and redeem me; preserve my life according to your* ***promise*** *.*
*Your compassion, Lord , is great; preserve my life according to your* ***laws*** *.*
*See how I love your precepts; preserve my life, Lord , in accordance with your* ***love*** *.*

In this excerpt of four different verses I see how David asks You to preserve his life in accordance with Your promise, Your Law and Your love.
There is such an abundance of forgiveness from You and salvation and in so many ways.

*http://bible.com/111/psa.119.152-154.niv*
*Long* *ago I learned from your statutes that you established them to last forever.*

Even David knew, though he lived thousands of years ago, that Your statutes were made to last forever. In his day there were probably people saying the Torah was outdated, since David lived so many years after Moses.
But David knew You and could hear You, He knew what was true and still true. Not only that but He wrote that they were established to last *forever*.
He had not thought of science trying to disprove You, but had he been here in age, he would probably have written the same.

*Look on my suffering and deliver me, for I have not forgotten your law.*

Lord, You know how much or how little I suffer. Compared to Your Son's suffering I have nothing to complain about, but You look at me and You understand me. Deliver me, Lord, for everything on Earth is suffering.
I know I need to stay on Earth to help finish with all my brothers and sisters what You have started, but help me to be delivered from the Satan. For with him attacking Your plans, I cannot do my work. I need Your strength to withhold him. I need Your power to keep Your Law.

*Defend my cause and redeem me; preserve my life according to your promise.*

You know what my cause is, it is only to serve You and Your Body. Therefore redeem me, Lord, so that I may serve You even more. Preserve my life according to Your promise.
Stay with me Lord, do not leave me. Forgive me for my sins.

*Psalm 119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked,*
*for they do not seek out your decrees.*
 
 
What is the definition of salvation here, and wicked? Is everyone who does not seek out your decrees a wicked person? It is true that they do not receive salvation, if salvation means the saving work of Jesus Christ.
But if salvation is Your daily work and protection from the satan, everyone receives that, right?
Let me be far from the wicked, Lord, and let me be close to Your decrees and seeking them. You have given me a heart of research, let me research what You really want.
 
 
*156 Your compassion, Lord, is great;*
*preserve my life according to your laws.*
*157 Many are the foes who persecute me,*
*but I have not turned from your statutes.*
*158 I look on the faithless with loathing,*
*for they do not obey your word.*
*159 See how I love your precepts;*
