# Psalm 99
*Psalm 99:1-3 NIV*

*The Lord reigns, let the nations tremble;*

It says "Let the nations". I see "let" as an imperative, a command. Therefore I interpret this as "*Let* the countries praise the Lord". This means we have to praise God, but it also means it is our assignment to bring the gospel to other countries and let them praise God. 
We should not bring it in that way that they will abhor God or obey out of fear, such as the Roman Catholic kingdom, but that they may praise Him for Who He is.

*he sits enthroned between the cherubim, let the earth shake. Great is the Lord in Zion; he is exalted over all the nations. Let them praise your great and awesome name— he is holy.*

We do not realize how great the Lord is. We are scared or full of respect when we see an angel or cherubim, because of the glory it radiates, but that is just the remaining glory of the angel who was in God's presence.

*Psalm 99:4-5 NIV*

*The King is mighty, he loves justice— you have established equity;* **in Jacob you have done what is just and right.**

You know what equity is, what everyone needs. You know what I need. You know what is just and and right. Even though I do not know the difference between just and right, I know that you will do what is best.
Let there be no space for doubting You.

***Exalt the Lord our God and worship at his footstool; he is holy.***

Let everyone kneel down and come forward to Your throne to praise You, just because You are holy, that is more than enough reason.

Difference between equity and equality.
**Equity**, as we have seen, involves trying to understand and give people *what they need* to enjoy full, healthy lives. **Equality**, in contrast, aims to ensure that everyone gets the same things in order to enjoy full, healthy lives. Like equity, **equality** aims to promote fairness and justice, but it can only work if everyone starts from the same place and needs *the same things*.

*Psalm 99:6-7 NIV*

*Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel was among those who called on his name; they called on the Lord*
*and he answered them. He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud; they kept his statutes and the decrees he gave them.*

I have forgotten whether Aaron created the golden calf before or after the Law (though it was certainly before the Ten Commandments). Though Aaron sinned in this situation, overall the three men listened to the Lord.

*Psalm 99:8-9 NIV*

*Lord our God, you answered them; you were to Israel a forgiving God, though you punished their misdeeds.*

I see that the blessings You gave Moses were upon the people of Israel. Moses' intervention saved the people.
While both translations of the next verse differ, saying You either punished their misdeeds, or avenged the misdeeds done to them, both are correct in this situation as well. The surrounding peoples were punished and Israel was punished as well. But most importantly, Israel was forgiven.

**Exalt the Lord our God and worship at his holy mountain, for the Lord our God is holy.**

When I draw near the mountain of the Lord, I must get rid of anything unclean. I must drop them like clothes and baggage. The mountain is holy, the foot of it is holy. Nobody is allowed to touch it.
I cannot exalt the Lord when I am still full of sin. Cleanse me, O Lord, so that I may exalt You.
