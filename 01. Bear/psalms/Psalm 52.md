# Psalm 52
*Psalm 52:1, 3-4 NIV*

*Why do you boast of evil, you mighty hero?*

If I look back at my own life I see that I was boasting of evil as well. It was cool to do the things other people did not dare to do, to show the world how tough we were.
That could be one reason why Doeg killed the priests, but not why he betrayed them. What is cool about that?

*Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God?*

Why did Doeg rather be part of Saul's servanthood than of King David's, who first of all was surely going to be the next king and, secondly, was a much better, wise and merciful king than Saul?
Even if Doeg did not believe in God, following David would be the wise decision.

*You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth.*

This probably is the explanation of my question above. He loved evil and falsehood. I do not know how one can conceited with that, but it is possible.
Perhaps it is something like the Joker in Batman. He does not care about the money or fame, he just wants to bring out the bad in people.

*You love every harmful word, you deceitful tongue!*

Doeg thinks he is cool, because he did something for the king, Saul, of whom he thought he was cool as well. But he did not, or perhaps he did, know that king Saul was evil and would repay him the favor, by letting him end up badly (according to rabbinical literature, but most certainly as a bad figure in history).

*Psalm 52:5-6 NIV*

*Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin: He will snatch you up and pluck you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living.*
*The righteous will see and fear; they will laugh at you, saying,*

If God brings you to ruin, that is really bad.
Uprooting you from the land of the living, is not something you want. It is not just dying, but it is stop living, the abundant life Jesus talks about, that is.
If God pulls you out of life, you will doubt why you have to live, what reason and purpose there is for life, and for everything in it, like work and food.
I guess something like a depression starts then, and the meaninglessness of life, as Ecclesiastes talks about.

*Psalm 52:7 NIV*

*“Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others!”*

There are so many examples of this in the world, especially in the United States. Yet there are so many people who follow and admire them.
People who buy up companies in order to sell them, who do not care about the people working in these companies.

People like Bernie Madoff, who only cared about money and did not think about the consequences for the whole country, economy and their own family.

*Psalm 52:8-9 NIV*

*But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God;*

An olive tree grows slow and its flowers are not as beautiful as cherry blossom or roses. Its fruit is not as sweet as fruit from trees either, but it is very tasteful and healthy.
You cannot see it and even have to learn to taste it, to value its worth. In the same way the righteousness imputed unto us is slowly flourishing and not always visible for the ones not looking through the eyes of the Spirit.

*I trust in God’s unfailing love for ever and ever. For what you have done I will always praise you in the presence of your faithful people.*

That is why it is important to tell our next generation what God has done for us.
Everything that God has done is good, we can praise Him for everything, even when it seems not praiseworthy, like someone's death.
God perhaps did kill the person, or He allowed it, but His sovereignty lets us know that what He did was not only good, but the best thing to do.
So yes, always praise God for everything that is happening in your life. Not for the sadness and misfortune you are having, but for the fact God allows it, for He has a purpose with it and He is letting you grow through it.

*And I will hope in your name, for your name is good.*

The Name of God is everything that God is, and all of that is good. So we hope in everything that is good, and we know that God only wants good, yes the best, for us.
