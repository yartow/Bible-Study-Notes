# Psalm 101
*Psalm 101:8 NIV*

*Every morning I will put to silence all the wicked in the land; I will cut off every evildoer from the city of the Lord .*

It is good to start out cleansing the country, so that the rest of the day will be dedicated not to the wicked, but fully for the Lord.
The evildoers must be cut off completely, so they will not grow back in the alter state to corrupt our work for God.
