# Psalm 49
*Psalm 49:1-4 NIV*

*Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who live in this world, both low and high, rich and poor alike:*
*My mouth will speak words of wisdom;*
*the meditation of my heart will give you understanding.*
*I will turn my ear to a proverb; with the harp I will expound my riddle:*

What comes after this is not so much a riddle, for those who understand it. It seems really easy, logical and the answer is even given at the end.
Yet at the same time it is immensely hard to understand for those who do not understand. It cannot be explained better than this Psalm, yet they still do not understand because there is something in their hearts preventing that.

But by meditation of God's heart it is possible.

*Psalm 49:5-11 NIV*

*Why should I fear when evil days come, when wicked deceivers surround me— those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches?*
*No one can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for them— the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough— so that they should live on forever and not see decay.*

*For all can see that the wise die, that the foolish and the senseless also perish, leaving their wealth to others. Their tombs will remain their houses forever, their dwellings for endless generations, though they had named lands after themselves.*

The reason I do not have to be afraid is that when wicked people come, I know I will live longer than they.
They may be threatening me, saying they will end my life, but I will live longer.

*Psalm 49:12 NIV*

*People, despite their wealth, do not endure; they are like the beasts that perish.*

It is clear here that people are not beasts, but they are *like* the beast. This is a strong proposition for Christians who do not believe in evolution of apes to men. 

*Psalm 49:13-15 NIV*

*This is the fate of those who trust in themselves, and of their followers, who approve their sayings.*

The Greek has the word *selah* here, even though it is after only the first sentence of a paragraph. Many think this is a musical term. Although this could be correct in many cases, where *selah* could mean something like chorus or repeat, or a *crescendo* in dynamics, in this part I would like to translate it as *so true*. 

Many people follow evolutionists, they have not figured out anything themselves.

*They are like sheep and are destined to die; death will be their shepherd (but the upright will prevail over them in the morning).*

*Death will be their shepherd* sounds really familiar to me. With some people it is obvious to see that their life is doomed, or so we think. It seems that everything they do is wrong, once they choose to do something else, it is even worse than what they did before. 
It is indeed as if death is leading them.

*Their forms will decay in the grave, far from their princely mansions.*

The remainder of the same verse as above. Though the verse numbering was thought by man, it still has a meaning, I think. There is a reason why this sentence did not get a separate verse number.

*But God will redeem me from the realm of the dead; he will surely take me to himself.*

God will not only rescue me from (not death, but) the realm of the dead (which means we can die, but God can take us out of there), but He will take me to *Himself* as well! 

Which king saves a meaningless unfaithful servant, disobedient and reluctant to change, and is willing to bail him out and pay the price of sacrificing his own son for it, and even then taking this servant to him, because he still wants a relationship with him? Only our God is such a king.

*Psalm 49:16-19 NIV*

*Do not be overawed when others grow rich, when the splendor of their houses increases; for they will take nothing with them when they die, their splendor will not descend with them.*

It does not say, go with them, but rather go *down* with them. 

I would like to say an *amen* to this. Many Christians think they can get away with maybe idolization of others, including myself, but the Bible speaks clearly that we cannot be overawed with them. 

*Though while they live they count themselves blessed— and people praise you when you prosper— they will join those who have gone before them, who will never again see the light of life.*

I do not understand why there is a small sentence within this verse.
