# Psalm 121
 
 
*Psalm 121*
 
 
*A song of ascents.*
 
 
 
 
*1 I lift up my eyes to the mountains—*
*where does my help come from?*
*2 My help comes from the Lord,*
*the Maker of heaven(A) and earth.(B)*

Lord, my help has always come from You. The good thing about it is that it did not matter where I was, I could always see “the mountains”, or the sky. What I mean, is that I could see You. There was never complete darkness, because You are present here on Earth and in my life.

*3 He will not let your foot slip—*
*he who watches over you will not slumber;*
*4 indeed, he who watches(C) over Israel*
*will neither slumber nor sleep.*
*5 The Lord watches over(D) you—*
*the Lord is your shade at your right hand;*
*6 the sun(E) will not harm you by day,*
*nor the moon by night.*

When I slip, it is not because the Lord did not warn me about it, He holds me and warns me, but I purposefully slip. It is all my own fault. He never slumbers, whether at night or in the morning, whether at work or at home, I always feel His presence. Not in a scary way, but in a peace-giving way.
 
 
*7 The Lord will keep you from all harm(F)—*
*he will watch over your life;*
*8 the Lord will watch over your coming and going*
*both now and forevermore.(G)*
 
 
All kinds of harm have tried to harm me, from all ranges of the spectrum, but God has protected me from all of it. It is by grace that I was born in this country, and by grace that I am healthy. And everything good that happens along the way is given to me by You as well.
