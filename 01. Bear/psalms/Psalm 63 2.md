# Psalm 63
For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David.

1 Truly my soul finds rest in God;

my salvation comes from him.

2 Truly he is my rock and my salvation;

he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.

Everyone who comes to God, and converts will realize this first verse. And when someone lives to be older and wiser in Christ, he will realize the second verse.
First he will realize that there is nothing in this world that can give a person *true* rest of the soul and of the mind, secondly he will realize that all this time, he did not fall and if he did, he was upheld by God.
