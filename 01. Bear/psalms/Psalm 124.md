# Psalm 124
*http://bible.com/111/psa.124.1-5.niv*
*If the Lord had not been on our side— let Israel say— if the Lord had not been on our side when people attacked us, they would have swallowed us alive when their anger flared against us; the flood would have engulfed us, the torrent would have swept over us, the raging waters would have swept us away.*

I am wondering whether this is something the Israelites realize, that it is You Who are protecting them at this very moment against all the neighboring countries wanting to attack Israel.
It is not for the help of America or the West, because many are against Israel, even indicting them to war crimes.
Thank You, Lord, for protecting the people of Israel.

*http://bible.com/111/psa.124.6-8.niv Praise be to the Lord , who has not let us be torn by their teeth.*

A fowler, being a professional bird catcher, perhaps the king of Egypt, has a distinct meaning in the word professional.
Even in Exodus Egypt was out the Israelites' blood, then during the time of the writing of this Psalm, and later on after the Second World War, and even now, if not Israel then it is the catching of Christians.
Even though it has been a refuge three times in the Bible, even for Jesus Christ, it has attacked Your people many more times.

*We have escaped like a bird from the fowler’s snare; the snare has been broken, and we have escaped. Our help is in the name of the Lord , the Maker of heaven and earth.*

But thanks to You, o Lord Almighty, Your people have escaped from the snare. I know You can do this for me as well. Whatever is keeping me in the sin of this world, You can set me free.

I know my help is in You.
