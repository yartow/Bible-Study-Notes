# Psalm 6
*Psalm 6:1-3 NIV* 

*Lord , do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.*
*Have mercy on me, Lord , for I am faint; heal me, Lord , for my bones are in agony.*
*My soul is in deep anguish. How long, Lord , how long?* 

At some points in my life I feel so weak, that I think I cannot handle any more negative things in life. Everything then seems to be hard, like work, studies, relationships and life.
It is at these moments that I think I need God's mercy. *Please have mercy on me, Lord, do not let me suffer anymore right now. Please let me be strong again.*
But in fact I know now that it is not just at these moments, it is all the time. Even at the moment of writing I know God is watching over me now, giving me wisdom and knowledge to read this Psalm.
If God had not protected me right now, the devil would strike down and hit me, and kill me. Life would be miserable, and unfortunately for some people it is.

My bones were literally in agony a while ago. My muscles in my back hurt because I lifted too much for too long a time, and upon getting the flu it hurt so much that I could not sleep anymore. I really needed God then.
For the first time I felt some compassion with people who have back aches, rheumatic diseases

*How long*, David writes, sometimes it seems like it never ends. He probably was just as weak as I, so weak that I even said *do not punish me*, whereas when I would be strong, I would say *if it is a punishment and Your will, so be it.*
However, the punishment is almost always shorter and less than necessary, because God is merciful.

*Psalm 6:4-5 NIV* 

*Turn, Lord , and deliver me; save me because of your unfailing love. Among the dead no one proclaims your name. Who praises you from the grave?* 

Deliver me from my *failing* love. Please save me, because I cannot save myself. I am not disciplined enough to keep loving you, or even at keep loving my wife the way it should be. But You are *unfailing*, You keep loving me whatever I do. 
Please bless me with whatever is good to You, even if that to me is a punishment, so I can praise Your Name. But if I am dead, how can I praise You. No one will know how much I appreciated all You had done for me.
So please bless me in a way that I can praise Your Holy Name.

*Psalm 6:6a NIV*

*I am worn out from my groaning.*

It has happened before that I have worried so much that at night I could not sleep. I have no clear memories however of having so much sadness that I could not sleep. David's emotional side is what made him a good king, I think, because he could empathize with the people, his own workers, team mates in war and especially know that God is a God with emotions as well. He could cry out to God, literally, and that is what God wants.
He does not want us to withhold our feelings towards Him and the urge to call on Him. That is what I have been doing and I have experienced that it is not possible not to go to God for help, for me. I am too weak to do things on my own, I need Him in all ways, emotionally and spiritually, and physically, to be beside me.

*All night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears. My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they fail because of all my foes. (Psalm 6:6, 7 NIV)*

Why would my vision be impaired if I have lots of sorrow, because of regrets? Could it be that someone who regrets too much will make decisions incorrectly?
Because of foes, what would that have to do with it?

Now I understand, they grow weak because of all the crying. They fail, means that David has cried so much he cannot even see anymore, because of all the sorrow his foes have caused him.

*Psalm 6:8-10 NIV*

*Away from me, all you who do evil, for the Lord has heard my weeping. The Lord has heard my cry for mercy; the Lord accepts my prayer. All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish; they will turn back and suddenly be put to shame.*

Now David has found courage to tell his foes to go away, because he knows the Lord listens to him. The Lord *accepts* his prayer. 
I should not take it for granted that the Lord listens to and accepts my prayer. It is all because of Jesus' suffering that He does accept it. I should be grateful every time God listens.
Thank the Lord, for His goodness and gracefulness! Amen.
