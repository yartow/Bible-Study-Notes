# Psalm 67
*Psalm 67:1-2 NIV*

*May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face shine on usâ€” so that your ways may be known on earth, your salvation among all nations.*

This verse indicates some important consequences. If He shines His face upon us, we will know His ways. His face gives brightness, and gives us light to see where we need to go and whether we are going the wrong way.
If we show the world the way to walk, then salvation will come as well.

*Psalm 67:3-5 NIV*

*May the peoples praise you, God; may all the peoples praise you. May the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you rule the peoples with equity and guide the nations of the earth. May the peoples praise you, God; may all the peoples praise you.*

You *rule* and *guide* the nations. These are the reasons to praise You, God, and why nations are glad and sing for joy. 
This means that nations where people do not sing for joy or are glad are not ruled and guided by you.
In America there is so much poverty and sadness, and its leaders do not fear you. Scandinavian countries are very wealthy, but people are not joyful, but rather depressed. In Japan people seem joyful and wealthy, but they are neither.
Lead our nation, oh Lord. We need You to lead our country, we need Your people to be in our government, people who fear You and live for You alone.

*Psalm 67:6-7 NIV*

*The land yields its harvest; God, our God, blesses us. May God bless us still, so that all the ends of the earth will fear him.*

God blesses us, but let us not forget to ask him for an eternal blessing, down to our next generations. Because God us a God if generations and He wants to bless our children and our grandchildren as well up the thousandth generation.
