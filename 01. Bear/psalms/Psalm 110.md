# Psalm 110
*Psalm 110:1-3 NIV*

*The Lord says to my lord: “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.” The Lord will extend your mighty scepter from Zion, saying, “Rule in the midst of your enemies!” Your troops will be willing on your day of battle. Arrayed in holy splendor, your young men will come to you like dew from the morning’s womb.*

It is clear that David is speaking of Jesus here, Who sits at the right hand of God the Father. God is telling Jesus to rule and that His troops are willing.
I was thinking that perhaps we are these troops, young men (of which I literally am one at the moment of writing) - and for those who are not young and male, those who are like young men in spirit.
There are many who do not believe and are not willing to fight for Jesus, but do not be mistaken, there are many, counting from history, who are willing to give their lives to Jesus.
*Psalm 110:4 NIV*

*The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.”*

Little do we know about Melchizedek, except that he was a priest and a king at the same time. I think this is the reason why Jesus Christ is compared with him.
Jesus can make intercession for us to God, but at the same time He is the King Who rules and judges.

*Psalm 110:5-7 NIV*

*The Lord is at your right hand ; he will crush kings on the day of his wrath. He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead and crushing the rulers of the whole earth. He will drink from a brook along the way, and so he will lift his head high.*

I do not have anything to fear from the rulers of this nation or of this world. For Jesus Christ will come, sitting on the right hand of God the Father, judging the nations and the rulers. Not merely judging, but crushing the rulers.
There is not a single country where ruling takes place as God would have wanted it to. The government consists of people pleasers, money makers and persons who are above all selfish.
Everything they do is for their own good, concerning the decision for every outcome concerning tax or the environment, driving or education they are merely thinking:  *"Will I or my family benefit from it?"*
They are not willing to sacrifice their own good for the good of the country they have been set to lead. A leader must love its followers and serve them and sacrifice himself, and that is not what government people are doing. #tags/politics
No government ruler is following the path of God and His righteousness and those who are trying to, such as the SGP, the State Reformed Party in the Netherlands, are shoved away and kept small to be kept without any significant influence.
