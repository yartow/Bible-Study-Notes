# Psalm 26
*Of David.*

*1 Vindicate me, Lord,*
*for I have led a blameless life;*
*I have trusted in the Lord*
*and have not faltered.*
*2 Test me, Lord, and try me,*
*examine my heart and my mind;*
*3 for I have always been mindful of your unfailing love*
*and have lived in reliance on your faithfulness.*

Does David dare to ask this because he knows his true heart?
Let me know my true heart, Lord. Let me know whether and when I have sinned. Instruct me when I think I have not sinned against You or other people.
It is very hard for me to ask you to examine my heard any my mind, as David has asked, but if it is what I should do, I will ask You: *examine my heart and my mind*. I know life comes with struggles and everything is a test; everything is part of the race we are running and everything You work out for the good. Please help me pass this test and finish this race, Lord. 
Indeed I have always been mindful of Your unfailing love, I have never doubted that You loved me or did it for the good, and it is because of Your faithfulness that I still exist, that I am still Your child, all because of Your faithfulness and Your promise to Abraham.

*4 I do not sit with the deceitful,*
*nor do I associate with hypocrites.*
*5 I abhor the assembly of evildoers*
*and refuse to sit with the wicked.*
*6 I wash my hands in innocence,*
*and go about your altar, Lord,*
*7 proclaiming aloud your praise*
*and telling of all your wonderful deeds.*

Not always, but I do my best not to be associated with the wicked, I abhor most of what they do. Help me to stay innocent.

*8 Lord, I love the house where you live,*
*the place where your glory dwells.*
*9 Do not take away my soul along with sinners,*
*my life with those who are bloodthirsty,*
*10 in whose hands are wicked schemes,*
*whose right hands are full of bribes.*
*11 I lead a blameless life;*
*deliver me and be merciful to me.*

Really, I Love every place where you are, more than the rest of the world. I can not imagine to have a day in my life without you, let alone eternity in...
Help me to lead a blameless life, and please deliver me from all temptations on earth and be merciful when I sin.
