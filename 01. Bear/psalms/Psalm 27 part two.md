# Psalm 27 part two
I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord. (Psalm 27:13, 14 NIV)

A translation in my own words: There is one thing I know for sure, the Lord's goodness will be shown in the land of the living. (the emphasis can also be put on "I will", but for me, today, this is not the interpretation I have.
I therefore need to wait for the Lord, wait until He arrives and until that time stay strong.

What is the original meaning of take heart?
