# Psalm 126
*http://bible.com/111/psa.126.1-3.niv*
*When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dreamed.*

Sometimes it feels like a dream, in a life where nothing is perfect, where always something is wrong, it seems like a dream when everything is perfect.
I have had the enjoyment and blessing to have experienced this a few times in my life, in my adulthood.
I exclude the juvenile period, because many with a healthy background, live through adolescence as if it were a dream, forgetting what it was really like as soon after they have grown up. Adolescence and the purity of it are too unreal as soon as a person enters adulthood.

*Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, “The Lord has done great things for them.”*

But I realize that everything perfect just come from You. We are in a dream, because it seems that for a short moment I am in heaven, where everything is perfect as well. Although heaven is much better than anything we have experienced on Earth.
My hope is that others, especially the unbelieving person in a relationship with an believer, will see what good our God has done for us, that He is the One Who makes us smile and gives us joy.

*The Lord has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.*

Not just great, but many and miraculous, necessary and needed, and everything and excessively He has provided.
I am full of joy for everything You have given me, Lord Almighty.

*Restore our fortunes, Lord , like streams in the Negev.*

Father, You are the most magnificent person there is. You define what is great and what something is worth. You have created diamonds and pearls and You have created beauty.
In the same way our fortunes have been given to us by You and taken away from us as well. Our fortunes were never ours to begin with and have always been meant for to serve You.
Like David's fortunes were meant to build up Your temple and Solomon's fortunes were meant for the people. So our fortunes are meant for You as well and we should not have any problems in returning these.
Help me to give them all back to You, Lord, but to do so with pleasure so that I might receive blessings from You.

*Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy. Those who go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them.*

I throw away my tears, I have put my sadness in Your hands, because I know You can create something joyful of it.
I know that when I return from the battlefield, whether the battlefield is what I am walking on right now or whether it is still coming, I will walk back as a victor, for You have always fought the fight with me.
