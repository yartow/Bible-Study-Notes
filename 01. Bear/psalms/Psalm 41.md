# Psalm 41
*Psalm 41:1-3 NIV*

*Blessed are those who have regard for the weak; the Lord delivers them in times of trouble.*
*The Lord protects and preserves them— they are counted among the blessed in the land— he does not give them over to the desire of their foes.*
*The Lord sustains them on their sickbed and restores them from their bed of illness.*

The weak ones are those who are not haughty and proud, they reside with God rather than with the enemy. The ones who have regard for the weak understand this principle. They do not look down on the weak, for when they do, they are joining the devil, allowing themselves to feel like they are better than other people.

*Psalm 41:4-6 NIV*

*I said, “Have mercy on me, Lord ;*
*heal me, for I have sinned against you.”*
*My enemies say of me in malice, “When will he die and his name perish?”*
*When one of them comes to see me, he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers slander;*
*then he goes out and spreads it around.*

The first thing we need to realize is that we need healing ourselves. We are no better than our foes, if it were not for God having given His mercy to us, allowing us to get near Him, learning from Him and becoming like Him in the process.

David notices that the people who come talk to him, always have hidden schedules. Most probably he was still a king when writing this, and especially then people wanted something from him, like his power.
The only reason why people wanted to talk to him, was to find new things to slander him with to others, in order to get a little credit themselves.

*Psalm 41:7-9 NIV*

*All my enemies whisper together against me; they imagine the worst for me, saying, “A vile disease has afflicted him; he will never get up from the place where he lies.” Even my close friend, someone I trusted, one who shared my bread, has turned against me.*

David probably was sick at the time and his foes wanted the people to know David was going to die soon, so the people would appoint someone else as their leader.

*Psalm 41:10-12 NIV*

*But may you have mercy on me, Lord ; raise me up, that I may repay them.*
*I know that you are pleased with me, for my enemy does not triumph over me.*
*Because of my integrity you uphold me and set me in your presence forever.*

Thank You, Father, for giving me the answer I needed, for giving me courage and hope for the things I have to lead.
I did not know if I would conquer this battle or lose, but the fact that the devil has not conquered me (yet) means You are protecting me, or in David's words, *upholding* me. And it means You are pleased with me. 
Please give me courage every day, just like David said, I too am poor and needy, needy of Your presence. Every day I need "fresh" strength from You, there is not a day that I can do without You. Thank You for letting me realize this (again).

*Psalm 41:13 NIV*

*Praise be to the Lord , the God of Israel,*
*from everlasting to everlasting.*
*Amen and Amen.*

From the beginning to the end, God deserves all praise. When there are no problems, I can praise God for it; during problems I can praise God for letting me grow in persistence; after my problems I can praise God for solving them.
Amen, that is true, and amen, it is true for everyone, in all ages, in any situation.
