# Psalm 53
*Psalm 53:1 NIV*

*The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; there is no one who does good.*

Indeed, everyone who says there is no God is a fool, because it is so obvious that that is not true. If one just listens, they will hear stories about people's lives being changed all around the world, and people willing to sacrifice their lives for something invisible.
*They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; there is no one who does good.*

Of all the people who say there is no God, not even one is good. Not that there are good people in the group that does say there is a God, but this is written in order to prevent people from thinking there are good people and therefore they will be saved, even though they rejected God.

*Psalm 53:2-3 NIV*

*God looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.*
*Everyone has turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.*

*Psalm 53:4-5 NIV*

*Do all these evildoers know nothing?*

It is strange to see that this line is separated from the rest of the verse.

*They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on God. But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to dread.*

King Nebuchadnezzar was dreaded with fear, were the Nazis as well? They were scattered though, but more in trying to escape punishment.

*God scattered the bones of those who attacked you; you put them to shame, for God despised them.*

*The strange thing* here is why it says you and God in the same sentence. Is David talking to Jesus and the Father?

God has kept his promise, he has scattered the Babylonians, the Romans, the Assyrians, the Ottomans?
Time will tell whether Muslims will be scattered as well. This is a somewhat harder question because they are offspring of Abraham as well.

*Psalm 53:6 NIV*

*Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!*

I think this sentence means: Oh, what an honor it is for me that salvation may come out of my own city, or it is a wish. Of course it is better to have someone from your own people save your own people, unlike the Egyptians who had Joseph save them and eventually ruled over them, though in a good way, but which is not always the case.
In times like these, when we sin so much, God still thinks about our feelings and delivers us.
