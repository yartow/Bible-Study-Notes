# Psalm 90
*Psalm 90:1-2 NIV*

*Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations. Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.*

Lord, You are my Savior and my Creator. No one knows me better than You do. No one knows this world better than You, and You know best how to treat it.
You know what will happen in this world, in the future, and what will happen in heaven. Therefore You alone can say what we should do.

*Psalm 90:3-6 NIV*

*You turn people back to dust, saying, “Return to dust, you mortals.” A thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night.*

We have trouble knowing the age of ancient artifacts. We can only guess what happened, we do not know what animals lived back then and we can only rely on literature of that day to obtain information.
*Yet you sweep people away in the sleep of death— they are like the new grass of the morning: In the morning it springs up new, but by evening it is dry and withered.*

We have existed for so short. If it is true that we have only existed for 6000 years, then that is something like six days for You. Our lifespan is nothing but a second to You, and yet we think we are so important.
Forgive us our arrogance, and let our lives be significant.

*Psalm 90:7-12 NIV*

*We are consumed by your anger and terrified by your indignation. You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.*

Your anger is because of our iniquities, and because we are full of iniquities and sins. We are consumed by anger because we are full of sins.
And now you place our sins in Your presence and we know that everything sinful in your presence will be destroyed.
We are afraid we will be destroyed as well, since we are full of sins.

Holisme, rommel maken voordat je kan opruimen. Rommel naar voren halen in je leven voordat je gereinigd kunt worden. Wat betekent naar voren halen dan?

*All our days pass away under your wrath; we finish our years with a moan.*

If You are angry with us, the rest of all of our days are gone. Every day will be like slavery, in misery. Everything will be our own fault for we have served the Satan.

*Our days may come to seventy years, or eighty, if our strength endures; yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away.*

We do not realize how short we live here on Earth, and how much sorrow we have caused You and others, and ourselves.

*If only we knew the power of your anger! Your wrath is as great as the fear that is your due.*

We do not even realize how great Your anger is, if we did we would also know how much we have caused it, that is one reason to fear you with great fear as we should. The other reason is that great fear is always Your due, because of Your greatness and just character, in which light we are guilty and sinful.

*Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.*

Realizing that we do not have forever to live, but only few days, will hopefully bring us to our minds and let us spend these days wisely. On the other hand we also have only a few days to please You, here on Earth, and to serve Your people, and to make your anger relinquish.

*Psalm 90:13-16 NIV*

*Relent, Lord ! How long will it be? Have compassion on your servants. Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.*

Dearest Father, we are so lucky to be in this age and time, where You have already forgiven my forefathers and punished them for a long time. We are living in a relatively good and peaceful time, compared to them.
Israel is still suffering from neighbors such as the Palestinians, which is their own fault for not obeying Your commands when You told them to get rid of all people. They also have abandoned the Law of Moses in the Constitution. But still I see you are there to protect them.

*Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen trouble. May your deeds be shown to your servants, your splendor to their children.*

How long did the period of trouble last? From the persecution of the Jews, the diaspora, until 1945 perhaps? It would be too much to ask You to give us 2000 years of paradise on Earth, at least in the current situation as it is.
What we do ask for is that our children may see the fruit of trusting and loving You, so that they may be saved as well.

*Psalm 90:17 NIV*

*May the favor of the Lord our God rest on us; establish the work of our hands for us— yes, establish the work of our hands.*

Favor can also be translated here with beauty, whereas in Dutch it is translated with loveliness.
Establish is translated as confirm. There is no language that can perfectly translate Hebrew, but viewing these different translations we get the picture.
God's favor, is a beautiful thing, done out of love.
When He gives us this favor our work is confirmed by Him, and if it is confirmed, it is established. For Who can stop the Lord when He confirms something?
