# Psalm 30
*Psalm 30:1-3 NIV* 

*I will exalt you, Lord , for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me.*
*Lord my God, I called to you for help, and you healed me.*
*You, Lord , brought me up from the realm of the dead; you spared me from going down to the pit.* 

It always start with You, Lord, You are such praiseworthy that You should be called upon first and foremost. You do what is necessary, you protect me from my enemies, you lift me up to a place where You can heal me, and You heal me.
I am grateful that You have not let me die. Everything I still am I owe to You and therefore all I have, which already was Yours, I give back to You, Who are much better able in using it.

*Psalm 30:4-5 NIV* 

*Sing the praises of the Lord , you his faithful people; praise his holy name.*
*For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.* 

This is so true, there is not a moment that I or anyone else cannot praise Him. Every moment of my life and everything I have at that time I owe to Him.
His anger is not only relatively short lasting, but absolutely short lasting as well. Most often He shows gentleness and forgives me and takes my punishment away.
I cannot imagine the amount of love God has for me, but fortunately I do not have to imagine, because I have experienced it.

*Psalm 30:6-7 NIV* 

*When I felt secure, I said, “I will never be shaken.” Lord , when you favored me, you made my royal mountain stand firm; but when you hid your face, I was dismayed.* 

Lord, how can You know so much about me? Of course you created me, but You wrote this Psalm thousands of years ago and it describes exactly how I am and how I feel.
Humans have not changed, human emotions have not evolved, and You have not changed.
I am but a weak and tiny man on this huge planet. Yet I feel amazing when You are with me (although I do not always realize that online You credit for it) and dismayed, or down, when You are not. Now at least I know why I feel this way and I know how to get back on that mountain.
Thank You, Lord, for showing me this.

*8 To you, Lord, I called;*
*to the Lord I cried for mercy:*
*9 “What is gained if I am silenced,*
*if I go down to the pit?*
*Will the dust praise you?*
*Will it proclaim your faithfulness?*
*10 Hear, Lord, and be merciful to me;*
*Lord, be my help.”*
 
 
Sometimes I just wish I could escape all of the problems and tests I face in life, even though they are far from any difficulties the Christian martyrs have faced and are facing. (I am so sorry for being pathetic for such small issues.)
But I know that You will gain no glory if I am gone. All the work You have done for me and in me will be gone as well, so I need to get back and show the world how You have saved me.
Help me, Lord , I therefore call upon You. Be my guide, be my light and help me show Your light to the world.

*You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy, that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent. Lord my God, I will praise you forever. (Psalm 30:11, 12 NIV)*

Thank You, Lord , I cannot thank You enough nor often enough. Almost every verse in this Psalm is reminiscent of me and of what You have done for me.
Every time I have joy it indeed is as if someone has removed the bitterness. Now even more so, in these past days of bitterness You have taken this sin away from me with so much ease, and it lets me feel more ashamed, because I know You have covered yourself with that sin for me.

You have given me so much joy that I cannot be silent, I am overflowing with joy and love for You. I am sure that I will praise You forever, as long as You are my God and protect me from the devil and his temptations.
