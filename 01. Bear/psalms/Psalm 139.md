# Psalm 139
*You have searched me, Lord , and you know me.*

As far as we can imagine and have words for it, the word *search* is what David or the psalmist used to explain what You have done with us. 
Searching means one has gone through everything to find the one thing he is looking for.
*I do not know what You have been looking for, but I would guess it is* **me**, everything about You want to know. 
Praise the Lord, that You are interested in something as little as me and even everything about me.

*You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar. You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways. Before a word is on my tongue you, Lord , know it completely.*

Not only do You search or have You searched, You see everything *all the time*! Even more so, You see it even before I do or think something. Not only because You know me so well, better than myself, but also because You are God Almighty. 

*You hem me in behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.*
*Psalm 139:1-6 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.139.1-6.NIV*

Lord God, You are everywhere, to protect me. I want You to be everywhere to see everything I do. Many things I have to be ashamed of, but other things I do especially for You.
It is true that I cannot understand the size of Your love and care for me. I do not even understand my own mind and body, let alone my circumstances, yet You have so much to protect me, to heal me, to prevent me from being tempted.

**Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.**

The psalmist David does not need to indicate what happens between the heavens and the depths, because of course God is there.
What strikes me is that David uses the word *flee*, because why would anyone flee from God unless he has done something wrong?
The next verse says something more about God.

**If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast.**

It seems like David is thinking of more ways to flee from God, now not going up or down, but from the East to the West. But even there God is present, however not to catch him, but to hold him with His right hand.
God is not present everywhere to catch us, but I to hold us dearly and to never let us go.

**If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me,” even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.**
*Psalm 139:7-12 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.139.7-12.NIV*

Now the three dimensions have been exhausted, and even the afterlife (heaven or hell), David still mentions another factor, light. But that too will not stop God from finding us. Even more, it only praises God for it proves again that He is Almighty and has created everything, both light and darkness. God lives outside of his factor, He *sees* everything, but not with light, for His eyes have no weaknesses as ours do. 

*For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb.*

Let it be clear to the world that it is You Who created me, and that You created everyone on this world, every individual and all of them You have Personally created, with utmost care and specific decisions.
The world, and science, thinks we are simply a merging of two cells, but I know it is far more complicated than that. David is writing here about kidneys You created, that alone is enough evidence of the magnificence of Your creation.
No merging cells could ever become as complex as a kidney.
But what David really means here, is our soul and our mind which You have created, which science cannot explain, not even in this age and most likely not in the future either.

*I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.*

This is exactly as I would say it, this is exactly the reason why I would praise You. You have made my body so wonderful, so beautiful, in every aspect, technologically wise or biologically, no matter how I look, there is no way anyone can create what You have created.
Most special is that You have created us full of fear. Fear that is meant for You only, to be full of respect for everything You can do and have done.
 
*My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.*

Nothing from me has been hidden from you, from when I was created until now or in the future. I have no secrets for you.
David writes here of a secret place where I was created, perhaps that is a place in heaven where You have created my person, but it could also be the place where two cells melt.

*Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.*

No matter how ugly or unformed I was, you saw it all. You imagined how I would be, You see and create the good in people. Thank You, Lord, for loving me though I am not worth loving.

*How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is the sum of them! Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand— when I awake, I am still with you.*
*Psalm 139:13-18 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.139.13-18.NIV*

It is amazing to know how many thoughts You have. You love me and plan my life for me, You protect me and are interested in me. This and much more and at the same time You love everyone on Earth as well!
But not just the number, the contents of Your thoughts are precious to me. For I know that everything You think about me is out of love for me, and righteousness and peace, that and even more and all in harmony with one another.
Mankind has not been able to make a law that has that effect.

*If only you, God, would slay the wicked! Away from me, you who are bloodthirsty! They speak of you with evil intent; your adversaries misuse your name.*

I hate those who abhor Your Name and all Your deeds. My enemies even say You have not done those, they stir up others into believing You do not exist.
I hope You slay them, but at the same time You command us to pray for them. Therefore I ask You, Father, to let them know You, to give them the time the deserve or need to come to believe in You and realize their sins, but if they still do not believe in You, please slay them for Your own glory.

*Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord , and abhor those who are in rebellion against you? I have nothing but hatred for them; I count them my enemies.*

Please let me know if I am in any part of my life or thinking siding with those who hate You. Remind me of that, but as far as I know, I am full or hatred for them.

*Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.*
*Psalm 139:19-24 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.139.19-24.NIV*

But only You know my heart, and that is why I ask You to check it. Please check it to see if I have any offense against the good in people, if so, change me. Let my hatred be only towards the bad.
