# Psalm 148
*Praise the Lord . Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise him in the heights above. Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his heavenly hosts. Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars. Praise him, you highest heavens and you waters above the skies.*
*Psalm 148:1-4 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.148.1-4.NIV*

The greatest things around us, both visible and invisible, are all praising the Lord, for they know that God created them. The angels are proof of it, for they live in His presence and see his beauty and magnificence all the time.
The sun and the moon, heavenly bodies that are so large we cannot fathom, so hot we cannot measure but only estimate. Even the earth itself is so large we cannot inhabit it. Only the places with mild climates are inhabitable and most of the world, covered with water or having extreme conditions, is (almost) empty of people.
We cannot understand our own world, let alone any other heavenly bodies. How could we possibly understand how great You are?

Even lifeless creations such as the waters and the skies can praise You and see Your Almight, yet many of do not and ridicule You. We are worth even less than Your other creations. Our knowledge does not lead to wisdom in many cases.

*5 Let them praise the name of the Lord,*
*for at his command they were created,*
*6 and he established them for ever and everâ€”*
*he issued a decree that will never pass away.*

There is no reason to praise the Name of the Lord, but the mere fact that it has been created by Him. A pot should be grateful to be living and praising his potter. The mountains are grateful, even though they cannot move, for the many things that live by them.
You might think, *the mountains and skies can be grateful, for they will live forever*, but our soul will live forever as well. We should be glad not to live forever on this imperfect world. 

*7 Praise the Lord from the earth,*
*you great sea creatures and all ocean depths,*
*8 lightning and hail, snow and clouds,*
*stormy winds that do his bidding,*
*9 you mountains and all hills,*
*fruit trees and all cedars,*
*10 wild animals and all cattle,*
*small creatures and flying birds,*
*11 kings of the earth and all nations,*
*you princes and all rulers on earth,*
*12 young men and women,*
*old men and children.*

*Let them praise the name of the Lord , for his name alone is exalted; his splendor is above the earth and the heavens. And he has raised up for his people a horn, the praise of all his faithful servants, of Israel, the people close to his heart. Praise the Lord .*
*Psalm 148:13-14 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.148.13-14.NIV*

Let everyone, and every animal praise the Lord. The animals show the magnificence of God in the variety of creatures, functions and extreme conditions they can survive in. The ability to fly, in different ways and in all sizes from tiny mosquitoes to eagles with wingspans of over two metres.
Everyone should praise the Lord, for He has raised a horn, that is something that the people can hold on to for strength.
Depending on the translation I interpret the next part of thos verse in two ways. The praise of His people is the horn. This means that I can get strength by seeing or listening to the praise of the people of God, which is in this case the people of Israel who are near God's heart.
It can also mean that God raises three things, a horn, the praise, and the people of God.
