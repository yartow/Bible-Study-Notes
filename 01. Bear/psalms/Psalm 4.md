# Psalm 4
*Psalm 4:1-5 NIV* 

*Answer me when I call to you, my righteous God. Give me relief from my distress; have mercy on me and hear my prayer.* 
The mercy of the Lord is when He hears your prayer.

*How long will you people turn my glory into shame? How long will you love delusions and seek false gods* 

*Know that the Lord has set apart his faithful servant for himself; the Lord hears when I call to him. Tremble and do not sin; when you are on your beds, search your hearts and be silent. Offer the sacrifices of the righteous and trust in the Lord .* 

Thank You for always answering when I call on You. Thank You that I do not have much stress, I have been blessed both in my situation and with peace of mind. I know that is, because You have mercy on me and hear my prayer, even though I pray too little.
I am sorry that I have given Your Name such a bad reputation by living such a bad life and being a bad testimony. Even still I am looking for money, a false god providing for false hope in false peace of mind.
You are the One Who has always given me peace, whether poor or rich, sick or healthy. Why am I suddenly turning towards something else for help? Forgive me, oh Lord. Keep the Satan away from me.

Thank You for letting King David here in this Psalm tell me that You, the Lord, have set apart the faithful servant and You will hear him. This means that if I am faithful, You will set me apart, You will use me for Your holy purpose. Please use me, God. Anything is better than being used by the devil. Anything is better than not having peace of mind. Knowing that You are in control is the best thing I can hope for.

I am trembling, because I know that You are Almighty. You know what is in my heart. You know that though I always boast in my strength and peace of mind, and my answers on where to go in life, right now I am stuck. I know that all this time it was You Who had guided me, nothing was from myself.
Thank You for letting me find out about this, for letting me wake up early in the morning, without an alarm, in silence to be seeking You. Thank You for reminding me that I need to work on my daily silent time with You.
The sacrifices of the righteous, does that mean that I have to give up everything that is not righteous? The right sacrifices are those that make me tremble out of fear, when I decide to hold on to it instead of giving it up. Trembling because I know I am doing the wrong thing and because I know that You know this as well.
