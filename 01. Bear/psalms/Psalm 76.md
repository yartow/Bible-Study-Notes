# Psalm 76
*Psalm 76:1-3 NIV*

*God is renowned in Judah; in Israel his name is great. His tent is in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.*

In Israel everyone knows God, they know what God has done for their forefathers and what He has recently done for them.
Unfortunately *everyone* is exaggerated, for it was most certainly not everyone who praised Him and not every generation either.
*The same is true nowadays, where most* *people do not even recognize God's existence, let alone His power, His deeds and miracles to save us. Rather they blame God for causing these.*
In this way they blame someone they do not believe He exists, and follow someone, the devil, whom they do not recognize either.

*There he broke the flashing arrows, the shields and the swords, the weapons of war.*

It is in Israel that You broke the arrows of the enemy. But not just there but everywhere You protect the innocent and the righteous. It is just that we do not see it.

*Psalm 76:4-6 NIV*

*You are radiant with light, more majestic than mountains rich with game.*

There is no way to compare You. Not even the highest mountains with the most beautiful ridges, during the most beautiful sunrise, with snow so white that is blinding, can picture the beauty and greatness of you.
Or whatever storm or hurricane, tsunamis and waves that destroy everything, even mountains, all of these seem so small from outer space. And You are looking at our "outer space". It is really unbelievable.

*The valiant lie plundered, they sleep their last sleep; not one of the warriors can lift his hands. At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both horse and chariot lie still.*

It is as if You are so far, to be able to see things as miniatures, but You are so close as well and inflicting punishment on each bad person.
You control every movement of every person. Even animals and chariots are controlled by You.
Dear Lord, please let everything that has been invented for war, be made useful to protect people and not kill people.

*Psalm 76:7-10 NIV*

*It is you alone who are to be feared. Who can stand before you when you are angry?*

Of You alone, Lord, I am afraid. No one can take my life away if You do not allow him so, and no one can torture me if You You do not want it.
Let me not be in Your presence when You are angry at me. Can I say it like that, even though I always want to be in Your presence?

*From heaven you pronounced judgment, and the land feared and was quietâ€” when you, God, rose up to judge, to save all the afflicted of the land.*

Merely the rising of You will bring fear into the land, it will make everyone and everything quiet. When will be this time, O God, that You come and save us from this world? Come quickly, O Lord.

*Surely your wrath against mankind brings you praise, and the survivors of your wrath are* *restrained*.

I know that whatever it is You do to punish this world, is for our own good. It will bring You praise, for people will start listening to You, they will believe in You. Perhaps they are the survivors mentioned in this verse.

*11 Make vows to the Lord your God and fulfill them;*
*let all the neighboring lands*
*bring gifts(S) to the One to be feared.*

Just writing about God, saying good things and even doing them is not enough. In order to be sustainable we need to make vows and *fulfill* them. I want to bring gifts to You, but I know that the only gift You would want from me is to obey You. 

*12 He breaks the spirit of rulers;*
*he is feared by the kings of the earth.*

Let all kings of the Earth fear You, o God, let them all bow down to You and show respect. Not just for our sake, but for Yours as well.
He spirit of our rulers should be broken, for it is the Spirit of God Who should live within the rulers.
