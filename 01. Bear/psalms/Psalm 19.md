# Psalm 19
*Psalm 19:1-6 NIV*

*The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge. They have no speech, they use no words; no sound is heard from them. Yet their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.*

Everywhere God's creation is visible, and every day they are telling something. Giving new knowledge to mankind. Even though they cannot speak, everywhere people if all cultures know the meaning of nature, the sun and plants.

*In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun.*
*It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course. It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is deprived of its warmth.*

Literally, nothing! No matter how deep sea creatures live, they will eat other creatures that did live in the sun, or of plants that grow by the sun.
The sun comes and goes. And it all has a function.

*Psalm 19:7-9 NIV*

*The law of the Lord is perfect, refreshing the soul.*
*The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.*
**The precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart.**
**The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes.**
**The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever.**
**The decrees of the Lord are firm, and all of them are righteous.**

*Contrary to what the world thinks of these terms, God's definition and implementation gives these words a beautiful meaning.*
*The law is perfect and refreshes the soul. It makes me feel at ease when I know what I may or may not do. If I know what pleases God, it pleases me and relaxes my soul.*

The statutes of the Lord are perfect. We are often in doubt and discuss about how our congregation should function, what we should allow or not. Or even doubting whether we should incorporate His statutes in our congregation. But giving God he advantage of the doubt is always a good thing. Eventually our congregations will become more like God's image if we follow Him completely.

The precepts of the Lord are right. Who can prove otherwise? Is there any proverb not inspired by Him and not applicable in life, or not true anywhere in the world?

The commands of the Lord are radiant. The Lord's commands teach us what is important in life. By not keeping them, we will learn a valuable but hard lesson; by keeping them we learn what it feels like to receive God's blessing in our lives.

The fear of the Lord is pure. It is not a fear you can grow out of, you will never get strong enough not to fear God. It is pure, the fear does not arise from pain or torture, God's presence alone will incur fear in any creature. Just like thunder, it is not that we are afraid of being hit by lightning, but the rumbling sound and loudness will incur a fear in us.

The decrees of the Lord are firm. They will never change, they are always and perfectly righteous, even when we think they are not, and even when we think God is not fair in unequally dividing talents and gifts between people, letting people be born in different parts of the world.

*Psalm 19:10-14 NIV*

*They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the honeycomb. By them your servant is warned; in keeping them there is great reward.*
*But who can discern their own errors? Forgive my hidden faults. Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then I will be blameless, innocent of great transgression.*
*May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, Lord , my Rock and my Redeemer.*

All of the above is worth so much more than the most precious metal or jewel (which will not even keep you alive) or the best food there is. In other words, keeping the Law of the Lord will make you far richer in life and make you enjoy life far more than anything else can.
It is only possible to live such a life when we keep humbling ourselves and admit our sins. Bit unfortunately we cannot see all of the sins we have committed
