# Psalm 145
*I will exalt you, my God the King; I will praise your name for ever and ever. Every day I will praise you and extol your name for ever and ever.*
*Psalm 145:1-2 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.145.1-2.NIV*

I will always praise You, for I know You, Lord. I know Who You are and that You are true; I know who the Satan is and that he always lies. He always gets me into more troubles than I already had.

*Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; his greatness no one can fathom. One generation commends your works to another; they tell of your mighty acts.*

There is not a single great thing You have done in this world that I can fully fathom. I understand of some things how they work, but I understand nothing of why it works as it does. I know the Earth has a magnetic field because of its iron core, but why that leads to magnetism I do not know and neither do real scientists. The only explanation they have is that the electrons in a magnet are all facing in the same direction. But we don't even know what an atom or electron looks like.
And that's just one thing. There are millions of wonders here on Earth I do not know about.

*They speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty— and I will meditate on your wonderful works.*  *T* **hey** *tell of the power of your awesome works— and I will proclaim your great deeds. They celebrate your abundant goodness and joyfully sing of your righteousness.*
*Psalm 145:3-7 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.145.3-7.NIV*

What people praise You for are Your majesty, which is amazing and cannot be ignored and must be praised aloud from our mouths once people see it, Your great deeds, and your goodness and righteousness.
You are King above kings and yet You are good for every lowly creature here on Earth. You have done awesome deeds and yet You still forgive those who do not believe in You or reject You.

**The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love.**
*Psalm 145:8 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.145.8.NIV*

You are slow to anger. All I have mentioned before could be reasons for You to be angry. You understand that most people do not see the wonders You have performed, You can forgive them for that, but what about all of the other wonders, even those who have seen it happening and then forgot about them, like the Israelites in the desert? Still, You are slow to anger.
You are rich in love and You love people unconditionally. You are compassionate, You feel our feelings and You really do something about it. You are gracious, even if we do not deserve all of the above, You still give it to us.

*The Lord is good to all; he has compassion on all he has made.*

It clearly says that You have made all. It does not say *"everything* you have made" but *all* *. First, because not everything needs compassion, only the people. Second, You have* **made** us. We did not come to existence by ourselves, but by Your hand. Your righteous right hand (cf. Is 14).

*All your works praise you, Lord ; your faithful people extol you. They tell of the glory of your kingdom and speak of your might, so that all people may know of your mighty acts and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.*

Your glory needs to be spread out over all the world. Missionaries and apostles have the greatest jobs in the world, for they can bring Your message and work for You full-time. Their career is to worship You and love their fellowmen, even in death they serve You, which may have even been a part of their job, for the first apostles at least.
Lord, let all the world know Your glory, let them know what You have done, what miraculous things, what splendor You are, and what You have done *for* *us*. 

*Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures through all generations.*

I have the hope that Your Kingdom is an everlasting one. When I get there, I know it will not be for a little while, but I will be secure there.
I also know that Your kingdom of heaven, on earth here, will last for a longer time than I will.

*The Lord is trustworthy in all he promises and faithful in all he does.*
*Psalm 145:9-13 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.145.9-13.NIV*

Trustworthiness and faithfulness, that is what You are and what I am not, but it is what I hope to be. Lord, grant me this trustworthiness and faithfulness from others, if that is according to Your will. But I also known it is a huge responsibility for me, perhaps even too great. Because the more trustworthiness I have with people, the more I can hurt them when I do something wrong.
That is why You give me small responsibilities for now, so that when I have shown success, You will give me larger ones.

*The Lord upholds all who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down. The eyes of all look to you, and you give them their food at the proper time. You open your hand and satisfy the desires of every living thing.*

Lord, You uphold everything and everyone. Not only do You uphold us, You lift us up. To lift us up You need to come to each of us personally, which You have done.
You give *them their* food at the *proper* time. Your way of precision is immeasurable and awesome. You serve us even though You are our Lord and God, and You give each of us what we need. 
I thank You for everything I have received from You for You have given the right thing to me on the right time. After reading this I cannot argue that. Though I do not know why, I will trust You and hold Your promise dearly, being that You will give me enough strength in any situation.

*You open your hand and satisfy the desires of every living thing.*
*Psalm 145:14-16 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.145.14-16.NIV*

When You open Your hand, You *satisfy* our desires. Most people do not know that when they are satisfied, it is because You put Your hand on them. I know that everything good comes from You alone. 
Not only do You satisfy us, You satisfy *every living thing*! 

*The Lord is righteous in all his ways and faithful in all he does. The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.*

May I conclude from this part that if anyone is not near the Lord, that his person is either not calling on the Lord or not calling on Him in truth?
On the hand, even if this person is doing so, the Lord is righteous in all He does. If the Lord chooses not to be near someone, He must have a good reason.

**H** **e** *fulfills the desires of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them.*

Of those who *fear* You, You fulfill their desires. Not only material desires, but also comfort they need, and salvation. 
Lord, please let my friend Yong Yang fear You, call on You and call on You in truth, so that He may be saved, that his desires may be fulfilled and so that You may be near Him.

*The Lord watches over all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.*
*Psalm 145:17-20 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.145.17-20.NIV*

God loves the wicked as well, but they do not love Him back and on top of that they destroy the lives of the righteous as well. Therefore God has no choice but to destroy them, as far as we know.

*My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord . Let every creature praise his holy name for ever and ever.*
*Psalm 145:21 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.145.21.NIV*

I will not say anything bad about my Lord, for all He does is good and righteous. He is holy, His Name is holy, it has always been so and will always be.
No person on Earth can claim otherwise, therefore everyone, and every single creature being allowed to live should do so too.
