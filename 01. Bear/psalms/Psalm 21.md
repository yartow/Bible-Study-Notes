# Psalm 21
*For the director of music. A psalm of David.*

*1 The king rejoices in your strength, Lord.*
*How great is his joy in the victories you give!*

I do not feel harmed when I know God is stronger than I am, rather I feel secure and joyful, because there is someone who can stand up for me and protect me. I do not have to feel ashamed that I cannot protect myself or solve problems myself, because I know God has created me this way, weaker than this world, too weak to resist the devil without God’s strength.
So each time God conquers a little more space for His Kingdom, I can rejoice too because I know it is for Him!

*2 You have granted him his heart’s desire*
*and have not withheld the request of his lips.[b]*
*3 You came to greet him with rich blessings*
*and placed a crown of pure gold on his head.*
*4 He asked you for life, and you gave it to him—*
*length of days, for ever and ever.*

You always give more than I ask. You do not withhold me from the many blessings you can give to mankind, and not only spiritual gifts, but material gifts we receive from you as well.

*5 Through the victories you gave, his glory is great;*
*you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty.*
*6 Surely you have granted him unending blessings*
*and made him glad with the joy of your presence.*
*7 For the king trusts in the Lord;*
*through the unfailing love of the Most High*
*he will not be shaken.*

God has granted David unending blessings, because he trusts in Him. I too must know that I will not be shaken if I keep trusting in the Lord.

*Psalm 21:8-13 NIV*

*Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies; your right hand will seize your foes. When you appear for battle, you will burn them up as in a blazing furnace. The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath, and his fire will consume them. You will destroy their descendants from the earth, their posterity from mankind.*

*I know that my Lord will always conquer*

*Though they plot evil against you and devise wicked schemes, they cannot succeed. You will make them turn their backs when you aim at them with drawn bow. Be exalted in your strength, Lord ; we will sing and praise your might.*
