# Psalm 3
1. There are so many enemies all around me, at work, in church, in my own home. They are taking away my strength, my concentration, causing me to not trust in God and not live with Him, putting God at a second place.
2. But I am forgetting that You, Lord, are my shield, You are the One protecting me. Without You I would have been gone all along.
You have been holding my head high all the time. The reason I have not given up yet is because You have given me strength all the time.
Every time I call, You will answer me, that is what I have experienced so far in my life. Thank You, Lord, for that. It is a blessing to merely receive Your answer.
6. It is even a blessing jut to be able to wake up every day. Without Your daily strength I would not be able to get up and go to work or finish school. Everything is so tiresome. It's because of You that I have gotten this far.
Please help me Lord to continue my life in Your hands and according to Your will. Then I will know, even when I have ten thousand enemies around me, that I can still safely live my life every day.

Psalm 3:7-8 NIV

Arise, Lord ! Deliver me, my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked. From the Lord comes deliverance. May your blessing be on your people.

Paraphrase it.
Save me, God, from all enemies, all desires and temptations. Break them so they will never hurt me anymore.
I know that whatever you give me, makes me free and delivers me from the devil. I wish for Your blessing, that is all I want.

My prayer to God.
I know that all I need is God's blessing, but at the same time I keep thinking about ways to get rich, start my own business and fulfill some goals that are or might be good for mankind.
However, I know that I am following my own lead here. This is not what God is telling me to do. I am not sure what He is telling me, but I do know that it is not about making money. Especially not when you desire it so much.
