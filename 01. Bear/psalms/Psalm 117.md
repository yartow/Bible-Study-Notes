# Psalm 117
*Psalm 117:1-2 NIV*

*Praise the Lord , all you nations; extol him,*

I have looked up the word *extol* here and it seems to mean *praise enthusiastically*. Ik other words, there is a difference between just praising God and doing that enthusiastically. 
I have heard it being said that anyone can praise God in His own way, some with clapping and standing or with their hands in the air, and some quietly sitting in their chair.
I think a difference in the form of praising is allowed, as long as it is enthusiastically.

*all you peoples.*

The NIV writes all *peoples* while the Dutch Statenvertaling writes all *heathens*. In a sense the Dutch version is correct, because all peoples, except for the people of God, are indeed heathens. 

*For great is his love toward us, and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever. Praise the Lord .*

Why do we praise Him, except that He is praiseworthy just for Who He is, even by definition? It is because of His great love for us. We will never realize *how* great His love is, but that it *is* great we can realize every day. His love, expressed in forgiveness, comfort and compassion, in His pleasure in us, and His persistence in forgiving our transgressions, and His mercy and grace. 
All are words, perhaps unmeaningful to many, but to me they are loaded with emotions and attached to it are experiences from a whole lifetime.
