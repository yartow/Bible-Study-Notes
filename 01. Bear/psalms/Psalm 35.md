# Psalm 35
*Psalm 35:1-3 NIV*

*Contend, Lord , with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me. Take up shield and armor; arise and come to my aid.*
*Brandish spear and javelin against those who pursue me. Say to me, “I am your salvation.”*

David here calls for the Lord to be with the ones who contend with him. It is only logical that one wants his friends and family to belong to the Lord as well, to share in this utter joy, peace and hope.

**May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who plot my ruin be turned back in dismay.**
**May they be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them away; may their path be dark and slippery, with the angel of the Lord pursuing them. (Psalm 35:4-6 NIV)**

Am I allowed to wish my enemies, the ones who have bad intentions for me, to disappear? To be driven away by God?

**Psalm 35:7-10 NIV**

**Since they hid their net for me without cause and without cause dug a pit for me, may ruin overtake them by surprise— may the net they hid entangle them, may they fall into the pit, to their ruin. Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord and delight in his salvation. My whole being will exclaim, “Who is like you, Lord ? You rescue the poor from those too strong for them, the poor and needy from those who rob them.”**

This part changes the story a bit, it is about innocent people who are attacked or ambushed. Is it then legitimate to ask God for something so vengeful?
Yes, I think, because we are not doing it ourselves, we do not act ourselves and God will only do what He thinks is good.

**Psalm 35:11-16 NIV**

**Ruthless witnesses come forward; they question me on things I know nothing about. They repay me evil for good and leave me like one bereaved. Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting.**

This changes the case even more, not only is David innocent, but also was he grieving for them when they were ill.

**When my prayers returned to me unanswered, I went about mourning as though for my friend or brother. I bowed my head in grief as though weeping for my mother.**

This is one thing I have not done, that perhaps withholds me the right to ask God for punishment for my enemies, in any case, it makes my case weaker.

**But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; assailants gathered against me without my knowledge. They slandered me without ceasing.**

I must learn to understand that suffering is not always for just a short while. Een though this was the case when I was young, now that I am more mature, God will test me even harder.
David here is tested by people who transgress, even though he is innocent, has mourned for them, and without ceasing!

**Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked; they gnashed their teeth at me.**

Like the ungodly? Are they not just ungodly? Whether Jew or heathen, one cannot say he still follows when doing such things.

**Psalm 35:17-21 NIV**

**How long, Lord, will you look on?**

David does not ask why, because he knows why, it is because God wants him to grow, and one cannot grow without tests.
It actually is not a real question, but rather a request to let this suffering, if I may say so, stop sooner, if it pleases the Lord.

**Rescue me from their ravages, my precious life from these lions. I will give you thanks in the great assembly; among the throngs I will praise you.**

There is nothing I can do to make You rescue me, everything on Earth is already Yours. But my praise is what you like, I will give glory to You for everything You have done and every time You have saved me.

"If that is the only reason why I may live, I will be satisfied." perhaps is what David thought, but it surely is what we should think as well.
No materials, no status or fame, only testifying of God's grace, would that satisfy me?

**Do not let those gloat over me who are my enemies without cause; do not let those who hate me without reason maliciously wink the eye.**

**They do not speak peaceably, but devise false accusations against those who live quietly in the land. They sneer at me and say, “Aha! Aha! With our own eyes we have seen it.”**

This is my request, Father, that those who gloat, sneer and wink the eye will no longer do so unrighteously.
Let your kingdom come sooner. For now I have these trials in my life for a cause, please use me and use my experiences.

*Psalm 35:22-25 NIV*

*Lord , you have seen this; do not be silent. Do not be far from me, Lord.*
*Awake, and rise to my defense! Contend for me, my God and Lord.*
*Vindicate me in your righteousness, Lord my God; do not let them gloat over me.*
*Do not let them think, “Aha, just what we wanted!” or say, “We have swallowed him up.”*

I should not forget to still call on the Lord, I should not think that just because it happens, it is God's will and I can say nothing about it. No, by prayer God might change His mind, figuratively speaking, and perhaps He wants us to pray, so we can learn to call on Him in these situations, and not depend on ourselves.

*Psalm 35:26-27 NIV*

*May all who gloat over my distress be put to shame and confusion; may all who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and disgrace.*
*May those who delight in my vindication shout for joy and gladness; may they always say, “The Lord be exalted, who delights in the well-being of his servant.”*

The first two lines indicate the same thing, whether I gloat over someone's distress, or exalt myself (whether related to that distress or not), both are wrong and both deserve punishment and shaming.
But if I delight in a person's vindication, against the devil, such as an addiction, whether this person is Christian or not, I am giving honor to the Lord my God as well.

*Psalm 35:28 NIV*

*My tongue will proclaim your righteousness, your praises all day long.*

Please let me watch my mouth, Lord, let me not gossip, and let anything I say be righteous. Please forgive me for saying things without praying first, without giving good thought to it. Instead, let me proclaim your righteousness, boast in You, in every thing you have created here in earth, boast that it is righteous, though it may not seem that way, and praise You in this way.
Please let the people on earth see that what they do not find righteous or fair, is because man's view of righteousness is corrupted.
