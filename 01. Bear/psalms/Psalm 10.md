# Psalm 10
*Psalm 10:1-6 NIV* 

*Why, Lord , do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?* 

Dear Lord, very little have I noticed Your absence, and I thank You for that. In times of trouble You have let me know that You will be there when the time is right.

*In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak, who are caught in the schemes he devises. He boasts about the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the Lord . In his pride the wicked man does not seek him; in all his thoughts there is no room for God.* 

In this case the wicked man would be me. Although I have nothing against the weak, the rest of it seems almost true. I envy the greedy and rich, and hardly look down on their sins and can even relate to it.
When everything is well, I hardly seek the Lord, unless I am being reminded of. It is not that that is my first thing that comes to mind.

*His ways are always prosperous; your laws are rejected by him; he sneers at all his enemies. He says to himself, “Nothing will ever shake me.” He swears, “No one will ever do me harm.”* 

This part can also be translated as

*They are haughty, and Your laws are far from him.* 

The wicked man is haughty, that is, arrogantly superior and disdainful, which means *showing lack of respect or contempt, the feeling that a person is beneath consideration, worthless or scorn, ie. despicable. A* nd that, unfortunately, is what I am too. I am always thinking that nothing can ever happen to me. Not in a sense that You are with me, but in the sense that I can handle it alone, based on my own strength, and when I can not, You will be there as a backup, because You promised never to let me fall. That is even worse than just arrogance, it is abusing the promise You have given me! 
I am so sorry for that, my Lord, and I deserve a punishment greater than others have received. Along with this knowledge, You have given me much more than others have received as well: talents, discipline, strength, courage, peace of mind and trust, but I have not appreciated it by honoring You, Lord, the only Person worthy of honor.

The *superior* or *prosperous* part, however, is true, but only because You have aided me throughout my whole life. Everything I have, is given by You. I do not know why I can understand certain things and others cannot. I do not know why I am blessed with health, a good physique or why I even have this character. But I know it is because You gave it to me, to use it for Your Kingdom. 

*Psalm 10:7-11 NIV* 

*His mouth is full of lies and threats; trouble and evil are under his tongue. He lies in wait near the villages; from ambush he murders the innocent. His eyes watch in secret for his victims; like a lion in cover he lies in wait. He lies in wait to catch the helpless; he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net. His victims are crushed, they collapse; they fall under his strength. He says to himself, “God will never notice; he covers his face and never s* ees.” 

This could be about me, ambushing opportunities to get money.

If i do not watch out I could become so greedy that I could rob poor people of their money.
Though I know God notices, I might cheat myself by making excuses. If not cheating myself, then it is cheating my boss. I am not sure about that, but I do feel I have to make a decision.

*Psalm 10:12-15 NIV*

*Arise, Lord ! Lift up your hand, O God. Do not forget the helpless. Why does the wicked man revile God? Why does he say to himself, “He won’t call me to account”? But you, God, see the trouble of the afflicted; you consider their grief and take it in hand. The victims commit themselves to you; you are the helper of the fatherless. Break the arm of the wicked man; call the evildoer to account for his wickedness that would not otherwise be found out.*

I must have more faith in You, Lord. You know the troubles of the weak, the poor, and You will break the arm of the wicked man. I should not deal with this myself, but leave it up to You.

*Psalm 10:16-18 NIV*

*The Lord is King for ever and ever; the nations will perish from his land. You, Lord , hear the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry, defending the fatherless and the oppressed, so that mere earthly mortals will never again strike terror.*

I must understand that You are King, for always. You listen to every person, and especially the poor people, so that people will not do anything against Your will.
