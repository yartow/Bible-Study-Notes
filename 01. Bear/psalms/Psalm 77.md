# Psalm 77
*Psalm 77:1-2 NIV*

*I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me. When I was in distress, I sought the Lord;*

Sometimes we can cry all night long and God will not answer us or do anything about the problem. Have we then realized that it is not God's will to change anything about the problem?
Or it could be that God wanted us to have the experience of persevering so we could use it in future trials.
In any case, God wants you to grow and does not allow any thing or situation to harm you for no reason.

*at night I stretched out untiring hands, and I would not be comforted.*

The thought that crosses my mind is that Asaph's hands are not getting tired. Of course it is a good thing he has so much perseverance, but if you are not tired, you still have perseverance left.
God sometimes waits until you get tired to fully give it to him to solve it.

*Psalm 77:3-6 NIV*

*I remembered you, God, and I groaned; I meditated, and my spirit grew faint.*

Asaph's spirit grew faint, but we should know that God's Spirit gets stronger as soon as our spirits gets weaker.

*You kept my eyes from closing; I was too troubled to speak. I thought about the former days, the years of long ago; I remembered my songs in the night. My heart meditated and my spirit asked:*

Sometimes we cannot sleep because of our troubles. Even when we do get a good sleep, perhaps we have not really rested well because of subconscious worries.
It is a good thing that Asaph starts asking God questions. How do you expect an answer from God if you do not ask Him?

*Psalm 77:7-9 NIV*

*“Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again? Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time? Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?”*

I am not saying I agree with his questions, but asking is a good thing to do. Even if you doubt God, tell Him You are doubting Him. He already knows, but He just wants you to raise the courage and tell Him.
The answer to the above questions is, *does God ever stop being merciful or ever not keep His promise?* It is a fierce *no*. 

*Psalm 77:10-12 NIV*

*Then I thought, “To this I will appeal: the years when the Most High stretched out his right hand. I will remember the deeds of the Lord ; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago. I will consider all your works and meditate on all your mighty deeds.”*

And God answers. He will give You the answer you need.

*Psalm 77:10-12 NIV*

*Then I thought, “To this I will appeal: the years when the Most High stretched out his right hand. I will remember the deeds of the Lord ; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago. I will consider all your works and meditate on all your mighty deeds.”*

And the answer is that one should remember the deeds of the Lord. Not just
remembering, but considering them and meditating on them. Think of how God saved you, and why He did so. He did it because He loved you. Has that changed? No, then why would He not save you this time?

*Psalm 77:13-15 NIV*

*Your ways, God, are holy. What god is as great as our God? You are the God who performs miracles; you display your power among the peoples.*

And when we consider God's deeds and miracles, we will see that they were of such a magnitude, saving not just one person but whole peoples and nations, destroying whole armies and economies if they stood in God's way.

I refer to God's love shown in this verse from Isaiah 43:4 NIV

*Since you are precious and honored in my sight, and because I love you, I will give people in exchange for you, nations in exchange for your life.*

*With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.*

This makes me think of a verse I have memorized a long time ago from Isaiah.

*Isaiah 14:24, 27 NIV*

*The Lord Almighty has sworn, “Surely, as I have planned, so it will be, and as I have purposed, so it will happen.*
*For the Lord Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart him? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?*

Our God is not only the greatest of all gods, because there are no other gods than God alone, but there is no one who can stop Him or change His mind if He does not allow it.
The Satan may push all of his effort in changing God's mind, but God will not be moved by bit.

*Psalm 77:16-19 NIV*

*The waters saw you, God, the waters saw you and writhed; the very depths were convulsed.*

The whole world, even the winds and clouds and thunder is afraid of You. They obey with the flick of Your fingers.

*The clouds poured down water, the heavens resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth. Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, your lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.*

So many signs You have given us to show You are God Almighty. The water, thunder, arrows of lightning, the size of a whirlwind and a lightning that can light up the whole world.

*Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though your footprints were not seen.*

All of these mighty wonders unfortunately are missed by most people. But knowing these is a privilege to us.
You can can choose whether to hide Your footsteps or not, for those who are looking for You.

*Psalm 77:20 NIV*

*You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.*

All of Israel's redemption is a myth according to the world. Just because they cannot find evidence it does not mean it has not happened.
Your Word is our evidence. The simple question of where the Jews come from is unanswerable if we do not assume Your Word is true.

You led Your flock, and that is what Israel is indeed. They are simple sheep that need to be led. Het cannot lead themselves, of they do so, they will stray, spread and be eaten by wild animals. They will long for short term food and drinks, and pleasures and places that will eventually lead to their death.
And they do not realize it. Unless You lead them and let them know.
