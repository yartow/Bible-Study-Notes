# Psalm 140
*Rescue me, Lord , from evildoers; protect me from the violent, who devise evil plans in their hearts and stir up war every day. They make their tongues as sharp as a serpent’s; the poison of vipers is on their lips.*
*Psalm 140:1-3 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.140.1-3.NIV*

Lord, please let me not get drawn into a discussion about my job, even if anyone accuses me falsely, let me not spread bad things about him. Let me accept my worldly defeat, but my heavenly gain.

***Keep me safe, Lord , from the hands of the wicked; protect me from the violent, who devise ways to trip my feet.***

But even more so I ask You to keep me safe. If I need to fall in, if that is Your will, I will gladly accept my fate, but if it not Your will, then help me anywhere You can. I admit I am not strong enough to avoid these traps. I was not even strong enough to convince myself of sin and call for a conversion. It was Your Holy Spirit Who led me to do that.

*The arrogant have hidden a snare for me; they have spread out the cords of their net and have set traps for me along my path.*
*Psalm 140:4-5 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.140.4-5.NIV*

There are snares here on Earth, especially on my path. I need You so that I will walk the right path. I cannot do it by myself. Even now I do not know which path is the right one.
Every company has something bad, something they sponsor which I do not agree with.

*I say to the Lord , “You are my God.” Hear, Lord , my cry for mercy.*

I praise You for hearing me. My voice is only heard by a few, the voice of people is heard by only a few others. It is the world's voice, being that of the devil, that we always hear. But You hear us, You feel what we feel.
And You not only hear it, but You act upon it as well.

*Sovereign Lord , my strong deliverer, you shield my head in the day of battle.*

Even without knowing, I have been in fights daily, with the devil is the world, or myself, and sometimes even with my fellowmen. But You have shielded my head in every battle. You have protected me, because You I fight for You.

*Do not grant the wicked their desires, Lord ; do not let their plans succeed.*
*Psalm 140:6-8 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.140.6-8.NIV*

Yes, do no let the wicked's plan succeed. You have worked so hard, Your people have worked so hard to build up Your Kingdom. But let not our will be done, but Yours and Yours alone.

**Those who surround me proudly rear their heads; may the mischief of their lips engulf them. May burning coals fall on them; may they be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, never to rise.**

This is a punishment wished for by David to anyone who surrounds him with the wrong intent. May this really happen to those who oppose You and Your people.

*May slanderers not be established in the land; may disaster hunt down the violent.*
*Psalm 140:9-11 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.140.9-11.NIV*

I wish not only for their punishment, but also that they will not establish themselves. I know this will happen, on the New Earth only Your people will be kings and rulers, but I hope that in this world we can see a bit of that as a hope. Though I know the hope and faith is greater of those who have not seen and believe.

**I know that the Lord secures justice for the poor and upholds the cause of the needy. Surely the righteous will praise your name, and the upright will live in your presence.**
*Psalm 140:12-13 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.140.12-13.NIV*

Even if it seems violent to the world how You act, and some even think You *are* violent, I know You are not. You are a righteous God, You secure justice and You care about the poor and the needy. Everyone who is upright and righteous will be living in Your presence.
