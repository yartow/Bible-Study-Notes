# Psalm 54
*Psalm 54:1-2 NIV*

*Save me, O God, by your name; vindicate me by your might.*

God's power does not depend on how much you believe in Him. He is mighty regardless if even the whole world does not believe in Him anymore.
Therefore ask of God, more than you can imagine.

*Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth.*

Psalm 54:3-5 NIV

Arrogant foes are attacking me; ruthless people are trying to kill meâ€” people without regard for God.

The people were so arrogant they thought they could give up David and reside with Saul.
They thought they could kill David, the servant of God, without consequences.

*Surely God is my help; the Lord is the one who sustains me.*

David still remains hopeful in the Lord, no matter how deep he is in trouble, or how many help there might be from Micha or Jonathan, he knows his help is from God only.

*Let evil recoil on those who slander me; in your faithfulness destroy them.*

Those slandering him, saying bad things about him, while they do not even know him, and only to get credit themselves, let evil recoil on those, again and again.

Psalm 54:6-7 NIV

I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you; I will praise your name, Lord , for it is good.

A Freewill offering is an offering out of free will?

*You have delivered me from all my troubles, and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes.*

For all these deliverances God does not even require sacrifices, but we may sacrifice something out of free will.
It is a gift from God if we are delivered from all our troubles, and if we have looked with our own eyes at our foes, it also means God has given us enough strength to have kept on going.
