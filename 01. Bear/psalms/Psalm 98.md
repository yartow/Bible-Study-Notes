# Psalm 98
*Psalm 98:1-3 NIV*

*Sing to the Lord a new song, for he has done marvelous things; his right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him. The Lord has made his salvation known and revealed his righteousness to the nations. He has remembered his love and his faithfulness to Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.*

It says here that everyone, or all countries have seen God's salvation. This is probably true for the world at that time, when it was smaller, assuming there were no Aztecs and Mayas or tribes like them.
God has shown salvation, but it was not salvation for everyone. Salvation for the Jews was not salvation for their enemies, such as the Egyptians in the time of Moses.

*Psalm 98:4-6 NIV*

*Shout for joy to the Lord , all the earth, burst into jubilant song with music; make music to the Lord with the harp, with the harp and the sound of singing, with trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn— shout for joy before the Lord , the King.*

The emphasis here is not just to simply praise the Lord, but to do that in the best way you can. Not just with her the harp, but with the harp *and* with singing, with trumpets *and* horns. 

TODO Matthew Laminaat

TODO uitleggen zondagsschool. Rechtvaardigheid voor de één is niet hetzelfde voor de ander.
Wij vragen altijd om rechtvaardigheid voor ons, maar Wat is eigenlijk rechtvaardigheid voor ons? Verdienen wij een beloning of straf?
Straf natuurlijk. Waarom vragen we dan om rechtvaardigheid?

*Psalm 98:7-9 NIV*

*Let the sea resound, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it. Let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains sing together for joy; let them sing before the Lord , for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples with equity.*

The whole world is praising the Lord, the sea with her sounds, the river with its clapping water, the mountains with its never ending sounds. The Lord loves sound, He loves to hear our sound as well.

I still need an answer for the question of why we ask for righteousness, while that would be disadvantageous for us.
