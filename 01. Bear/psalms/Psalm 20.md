# Psalm 20
*Psalm 20:1-5 NIV*

*May the Lord answer you when you are in distress; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.*
*May he send you help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion.*
*May he remember all your sacrifices and accept your burnt offerings.*

*Selah*

*May he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed.*
*May we shout for joy over your victory and lift up our banners in the name of our God.*

*May the Lord grant all your requests.*

I have used my own markup for this text, and this is how I interpret it. Three times God helps us, first.
He answers our calls, He sends help from the sanctuary, He remembers our sacrifices. He does not *have* to accept our sacrifices, our sacrifices are even far from pure, we always have a hidden intention, even when we do not know it ourselves. 

Then comes the part where it becomes personal. The Lord gives us the desires of our hearts, we shout for joy, He grants all our requests.
It is not just protection He gives us over our enemies, He also longs for us to be happy and joyful.
We should always remember the source of our joy. Our victories, in whatever field, are because of Him.

*Psalm 20:6-9 NIV*

*Now this I know: The Lord gives victory to his anointed.*

It's the Lord Who gives victory.

*He answers him from his heavenly sanctuary with the victorious power of his right hand.*

The Lord answers.

*Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.*

We have many tools in this world, but our trust is on God our Lord.

*They are brought to their knees and fall, but we rise up and stand firm. Lord , give victory to the king! Answer us when we call!*

This verse indicates the enemies were standing tall, before being brought down to their knees. We, however, were down but now are rising and standing. In the end the Lord will give us victory.
