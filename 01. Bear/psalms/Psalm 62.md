# Psalm 62
*For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David.*

*1 Truly my soul finds rest in God;*

*my salvation comes from him.*

*2 Truly he is my rock and my salvation;*

*he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.*

Everyone who comes to God, and converts will realize this first verse. And when someone lives to be older and wiser in Christ, he will realize the second verse.
First he will realize that there is nothing in this world that can give a person true freedom, the true feeling rest and peace. Secondly, he will realize that nothing can be more firm than God's foundation.

*Psalm 62:3-4 NIV*

*How long will you assault me? Would all of you throw me down— this leaning wall, this tottering fence? Surely they intend to topple me from my lofty place; they take delight in lies. With their mouths they bless, but in their hearts they curse.*

Father, I do not know if people are assaulting me, or saying bad things about me at the moment. All I care about is that you will get the glory, and my hope is that I may help You in showing it.

*Psalm 62:5-8 NIV*

*Yes, my soul, find rest in God; my hope comes from him. Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will not be shaken. My salvation and my honor depend on God ; he is my mighty rock, my refuge. Trust in him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge.*

Yes, as David says, my rest can be found in God, for the only thing that should not give me rest is if I have not been saved. But this depends on God only, and God is reliable, like a refuge, a mighty rock that no one can move or break.

*Surely the lowborn are but a breath, the highborn are but a lie. If weighed on a balance, they are nothing; together they are only a breath.*
*Psalm 62:9 NIV*

*Psalm 62:10-12 NIV*

*Do not trust in extortion or put vain hope in stolen goods; though your riches increase, do not set your heart on them.*

Could anything be added to this in this current age of piracy and copyright infringement?
People may not extort, or have vain hope in it, as if it will save their lives, but they do have a vain expectation that there are no consequences to all of this.
They want things so bad they are willing to steal for it. In this sense they are putting their hearts on riches. They are trading a sin for a movie.

*One thing God has spoken, two things I have heard: “Power belongs to you, God, and with you, Lord, is unfailing love”; and, “You reward everyone according to what they have done.”*

The first thing means that God is Almighty, He can do everything and everything He does is out of love .
The second thing we learn here is that we all suffer or rejoice from the consequences of our actions.
And all of this is done out of love for us.
