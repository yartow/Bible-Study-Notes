# Psalm 12
*Psalm 12:1-4 NIV* 

*Help, Lord , for no one is faithful anymore; those who are loyal have vanished from the human race. Everyone lies to their neighbor; they flatter with their lips but harbor deception in their hearts.* 

*May the Lord silence all flattering lips and every boastful tongue— those who say, “By our tongues we will prevail; our own lips will defend us—who is lord over us?”* 

This is what I see every day, everyone has an intention of being friendly to another person. I cannot trust anyone anymore. Help me, Lord, to not be suspicious about everyone, because surely there must be someone still loyal to You?
It is so hard to accept it when I see people who think they do not need You or a Lord over their lives; people who think they can do anything and get away with it, and still think their conscience is clean, or at least say so.

*Psalm 12:5-8 NIV* 

*“Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan, I will now arise,” says the Lord . “I will protect them from those who malign them.” And the words of the Lord are flawless, like silver purified in a crucible, like gold refined seven times.* 

*You, Lord , will keep the needy safe and will protect us forever from the wicked, who freely strut about when what is vile is honored by the human race.*
 
But I also know there will be an end to all this, You have compassion with the poor and needy and will protect them when You think the time is right. And we must trust Your Word.
