# Psalm 8
*Psalm 8:1-4 NIV*

*Lord , our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!*

*You have set your glory in the heavens. Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger.*

Though people do not admit it, and wrongly and disrespectfully use Your Name, they know there is a God, they know You are watching them. They feel they are doing wrong, but the world keeps telling them that there is no God. Science has proven different, they think, but at the same time they have a conscience, which cannot be explained by science.
Who are God's enemies? I thought that was only the Satan and his demons, but in this case, why would the praise of infants and children be a stronghold? Perhaps they are the unbelievers, the ones opposed to God. Yet their children may come to Christ and get to know Him, and their infants who cannot speak yet are praising God with their voice. The children who are so young that they do not know what sin is yet, are praising God too perhaps, with everything they do. They are showing how wonderful it is to be a creation of God, before they are influenced by God.

*When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?*

Indeed, we are so small, so much small than the universe, but You are so mindful of everything. You have made everything just for us.

*Psalm 8:5-9 NIV*

*You have made them a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honor. You made them rulers over the works of your hands; you put everything under their feet: all flocks and herds, and the animals of the wild, the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.*

Why have You given us so much glory, Lord, and given us such a bid responsibility, while You knew we were going to turn our backs on You. We have destroyed everything Your hands have made, a these flocks and herds, animals, birds and fish and other sea creatures.
Oil pollutes Your atmosphere, and the lungs of Your children, animals are injected with growth hormones and antibiotics before we eat them, and animals we do not eat, we kill for fun or for the money; the fish are polluted by everything else as well and good kept to grow in cages instead of being free.
I cannot think of a single thing that we have not destroyed except for the depths of the sea, but only because we have not reached it yet.

Could it be that we have destroyed our own body as well? Your body, the Church, we would certainly have destroyed if it were not for Your intervention through the Holy Spirit. And our bodies, I think most of us are destroying it, both consciously and unconsciously.
Please help me, Lord, not to destroy my body, my mind and soul, my heart, my strength and my relationship with You, first of all, but with my fellow man as well.

*Lord , our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!*
