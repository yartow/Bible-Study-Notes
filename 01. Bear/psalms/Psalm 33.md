# Psalm 33
*Sing joyfully to the Lord, you righteous; it is fitting for the upright to praise him.*
*Praise the Lord with the harp; make music to him on the ten-stringed lyre.*
*Sing to him a new song; play skillfully, and shout for joy. (Psalm 33:1-3 NIV)*

It is fitting, we should be grateful for that. We are allowed to come to Him in worship, our music is accepted by Him, our instruments are as well. We are allowed to write new songs to Him.
For Him we will play skillfully, for He is not just any Person, He is God. We will do our utmost to give Him our best performance.

*For the word of the Lord is right and true; he is faithful in all he does.*
*The Lord loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of his unfailing love.*

It is not a coincidence that righteousness and (unfailing) love are in the same sentence for it is because of His love that God *is* righteousness Himself. 

*By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth.*
*He gathers the waters of the sea into jars; he puts the deep into storehouses.*
*Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the people of the world revere him.*
*For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm. (Psalm 33:4-9 NIV)*

The ease with which all of it is created is magnificent. Humans cannot even reach the bottom of the sea, or find ships or air crafts if they have sunk to the bottom; we do not even know what animals exist on the bottom of the ocean, but God puts the whole sea in a jar.
Creation of a any object like space ships or boats, takes us years, but God speaks, and it is.

*The Lord foils the plans of the nations; he thwarts the purposes of the peoples.*
*But the plans of the Lord stand firm forever, the purposes of his heart through all generations. (Psalm 33:10, 11 NIV)*

Our Lord has shown His miracles and kept His promise once more, as always, in the Netherlands, for example. Ritual slaughter is not banished, instead it is handed more carefully. The purpose of the people of the Netherlands probably was not their love for animals, but to attack Muslims and You, perhaps not knowingly, but surely they want to ban religion out of this country.
No religious influence must exist in education, only "science", is what they want.

*Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people he chose for his inheritance. From heaven the Lord looks down and sees all mankind; from his dwelling place he watches all who live on earthâ€” he who forms the hearts of all, who considers everything they do. (Psalm 33:12-15 NIV)*

The Lord is God and He is a personal God. He sees us, He feels with us, and He sees our actions too.

*No king is saved by the size of his army; no warrior escapes by his great strength.*
*A horse is a vain hope for deliverance; despite all its great strength it cannot save.*

I cannot escape trouble by how good or great I am. Of course I should not forget that whatever I have and am is by grace alone as well.

*But the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him, on those whose hope is in his unfailing love, to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine. (Psalm 33:16-19 NIV)*

I know, because I fear You, that Your love is unfailing, you will not let me die and neither will You let my relationship and love for Sandra die. You have blessed my marriage and though we are in famine right now, we can and will get out of this period alive, our relationship sparkling like it is new, full of your unfailing love.

*We wait in hope for the Lord; he is our help and our shield. In him our hearts rejoice, for we trust in his holy name. May your unfailing love be with us, Lord, even as we put our hope in you. (Psalm 33:20-22 NIV)*

Sometimes we need to wait. But we should always hope, because He will come.
