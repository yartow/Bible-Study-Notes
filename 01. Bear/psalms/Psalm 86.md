# Psalm 86
*Psalm 86:1-4 NIV*

*Hear me, Lord , and answer me,*
*for I am poor and needy.*

*Guard my life,*
*for I am faithful to you;*

*save your servant who trusts in you. You are my God;*

*have mercy on me, Lord,*
*for I call to you all day long.*

*Bring joy to your servant, Lord,*
*for I put my trust in you.*

If I have analyzed this verse correctly, I see five things that David asks of God. He asks for
Contact with God
His life to be saved (second and third merged together)
His life not on be too hard
To have joy in life

But for everything he asks, he also gives a reason. No random reasons, but I reasons coupled with what he asks of God.

1. David asks for contact with God because He is poor and needy. When I do not have money or help, in fact I have nothing to help me (and perhaps in David's case he did not even have friends or family by his side or people whom he could trust), I need contact with God.

2. David asks for his life to be saved, because he has been God's faithful servant, only God is his god. It is only logical that the One you have been faithful to, is the one who should save you.

3. Mercy is not given to a person because of what this person has done, but it sometimes is given based on what this person shows, such as regret, remorse, sorrow or pain.
David calls on God all the time and asks for mercy, indicating he knows he does not deserve it.

4. If you trust in the Lord, you will receive joy. David thought so too, and the Lord indeed gives joy, because everything you do out of trust in God, will surely make You succeed and will be blessed by God.

*Psalm 86:5-7 NIV*

*You, Lord, are forgiving and good, abounding in love to all who call to you. Hear my prayer, Lord ; listen to my cry for mercy. When I am in distress, I call to you, because you answer me.*

Yes, Father, I know You are good and I have to remember that. Never have You failed to commit to Your promises, never have You done anything that was bad for me.
I need Your help in this difficult situation. I see no way out, but to trust in You, and call on to You, to beg for help, because You are the only person Who can help us out right now.
Please let me not be dependent on other people, on money or anything else. Let me be depending on You only, Lord, and put my full trust in You.
This is my prayer.

*Psalm 86:8-10 NIV*

*Among the gods there is none like you, Lord; no deeds can compare with yours.*

Is there any god as powerful as You are, all-knowing and compassionate, Who provides even before we ask, both the righteous as the unrighteousness, Who knows and controls the future, and plans everything for us for our good.

*All the nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord; they will bring glory to your name. For you are great and do marvelous deeds; you alone are God.*

When the nations find out that all the good in the world was given to them by You, they will all come and worship You.

*Psalm 86:11-13 NIV*

*Teach me your way, Lord , that I may rely on your faithfulness; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name. I will praise you, Lord my God, with all my heart; I will glorify your name forever. For great is your love toward me; you have delivered me from the depths, from the realm of the dead.*

Let me become like You, Lord Jesus, fully relying on Your Father, when You were here in Earth, and let me rely on You only.
Let me glorify Your Name, that is all that You am and all the good You are and have done, forever, no matter what will happen in the future.
One thing is for sure, You love me deeply, I know that because of what You have already done for me even before I knew You.

*Psalm 86:14-17 NIV*

*Arrogant foes are attacking me, O God; ruthless people are trying to kill meâ€” they have no regard for you. But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.*

Even the people who are arrogant, with killing intent, with no regard to You, even to those people You are compassionate and gracious, You give them a chance as well.

*Turn to me and have mercy on me; show your strength in behalf of your servant; save me, because I serve you just as my mother did.*

Show Your strength, yes, not for me, but so I can serve You. Save me, so I can serve You.

*Give me a sign of your goodness, that my enemies may see it and be put to shame, for you, Lord , have helped me and comforted me.*

Yes, Lord, do net let me, but You be the strongest argument against my enemies. May they be put to shame not by me, but by Your goodness, which they can see in me.

You have always helped me out, in all situations in life. Let that be a testimony of Your goodness, O Lord, and let that shut their mouths.
