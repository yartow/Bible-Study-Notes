# Psalm 31
*Psalm 31:1-5 NIV*

*In you, Lord , I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame; deliver me in your righteousness.*
*Turn your ear to me, come quickly to my rescue; be my rock of refuge, a strong fortress to save me.*
*Since you are my rock and my fortress, for the sake of your name lead and guide me.*
*Keep me free from the trap that is set for me, for you are my refuge.*
*Into your hands I commit my spirit; deliver me, Lord , my faithful God.*

Dear Father, I know the road ahead is hard and full of traps, but I know You are there all the time with. All the way long I will stand on the Rock and be led by You.
I need to commit not only my body and soul and everything I own (or am keeping care of), but my spirit as well. You may control everything I know about You.
Deliver me, even though I do not even know what will happen, I still ask You because I know it will be harder than I can imagine. Give me strength, Lord, and thank You for the warning.

Psalm 31:6-8 NIV

I hate those who cling to worthless idols; as for me, I trust in the Lord .
I will be glad and rejoice in your love, for you saw my affliction and knew the anguish of my soul.
You have not given me into the hands of the enemy but have set my feet in a spacious place.

I know how promiseful idols seem, money and career can promise you anything, but they cannot give you your purpose. Without a purpose you cannot feel your are worth something to someone.
I am glad that the Lord has saved me from following these idols for too long. I have been anguished and afflicted as well, by looking too much at what I do not have. But You have prevented me from transforming into one of those followers.
In that sense, You have not given me in the hands of my enemies, but kept me to Yourself.

*Psalm 31:12-13 NIV*

*I am forgotten as though I were dead; I have become like broken pottery. For I hear many whispering, “Terror on every side!” They conspire against me and plot to take my life.*

Perhaps this is what Sandra is feeling, and I sure have felt it as well. When God is with you, when you look at things from God's perspective, all enemies look much smaller though. The only reason why enemies look large, is because you are looking at a small God, which is not the God of the Bible.

*Psalm 31:14-18 NIV*

*But I trust in you, Lord ; I say, “You are my God.” My times are in your hands;*

My times, the time when it is right to act, to do what You want me to do, is decided by You. I trust You that Your time is also the best to do it.

*deliver me from the hands of my enemies, from those who pursue me.*
*Let your face shine on your servant; save me in your unfailing love.*
*Let me not be put to shame, Lord , for I have cried out to you; but let the wicked be put to shame and be silent in the realm of the dead.*
*Let their lying lips be silenced, for with pride and contempt they speak arrogantly against the righteous.*

Not humans, but the devil pursues me with evil thoughts and temptations. Save me, Lord. Only by knowing how much You love me, I will regain and retain my conscientiousness.
Most importantly, I do not want to ashame You, my Lord, and let evil get a grip on me.
Do not let them change me with their insults or so called proofs of science. Let me be firm in my belief and let my belief be in You and not in science.

*Psalm 31:19-20 NIV*

*How abundant are the good things that you have stored up for those who fear you, that you bestow in the sight of all, on those who take refuge in you. In the shelter of your presence you hide them from all human intrigues; you keep them safe in your dwelling from accusing tongues.*

Dear Father, You do not only give me so much good I do not earn, but You also give it to me in front of the everyone. Let all the young people see how blessed I am for following You and let them follow You. Let the congregation see and follow Your ways.
You are my hiding place, You have given me ideas and initiatives and protected them from accusing tongues. Thank You for realizing that and having learned that I should always first bring an idea to You and ask for Your protection against human intrigues. Please help me to keep on doing that.

*Psalm 31:21-22 NIV*

*Praise be to the Lord , for he showed me the wonders of his love when I was in a city under siege.*
*In my alarm I said, “I am cut off from your sight!” Yet you heard my cry for mercy when I called to you for help.*

Dear Father, thank You for showing me that it is always possible to praise You, in any circumstance. Even under siege David gave You praise, I must praise You too every day, no matter what happens, because in peace and happiness I can praise You for that, and in despair and under attack, I can praise You for the wonders You will show me.
You hear my cry even when I do not see You. Let me be reminded of this, every day.

Love the Lord, all his faithful people!
The Lord preserves those who are true to him,
but the proud he pays back in full.
Be strong and take heart, all you who hope in the Lord. (Psalm 31:23, 24 NIV)

I need to stay with You, be loyal to You. I know I need Your power for this, because the devil is tempting me with all his power and earthly might. But You, Lord , have heavenly power and might and reign over all. You will not allow anyone to snatch me out of Your hand.
Preserve me, oh Lord , I had rather be in Your prison than walking freely in the kingdom of Satan. Let pride not be my trait, let it not be something I am known for. Let me boast only in You and that You have done everything for me. All the miracles in my life are out of my control, You gave them to me to please You. Let people see that and know that I am but a mere human weakling, fully depending on You for my joy and happiness.
In this way I can stay strong, I can defeat the devil when I keep hoping in You.
