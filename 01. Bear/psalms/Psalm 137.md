# Psalm 137
### *Psalm 137*

*1 By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept*
*when we remembered Zion.*
*2 There on the poplars*
*we hung our harps,*
*3 for there our captors asked us for songs,*
*our tormentors demanded songs of joy;* *they said, “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”*

I cannot imagine how tough it must be to reside or be taken away to another country, remembering my old country, the land that God had given me. I do not understand one bit of the feelings of the Jews at that time, or in this time longing for Israel. But what I do understand is how my land, up in heaven, is where I long to be.

*4 How can we sing the songs of the Lord*
*while in a foreign land?*
*5 If I forget you, Jerusalem,*
*may my right hand forget its skill.*
*6 May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth*
*if I do not remember you,*
*if I do not consider Jerusalem*
*my highest joy.*

I do not understand why the Psalmist would have troubles singing in a foreign land. Perhaps he felt too ashamed to sing songs about from a country from which he has been banned, Biblically seen, for God had banned the Jews from Israel because they were disobedient. But it is not as if he has forgotten about Jerusalem.
 
 
*Remember, Lord, what the Edomites did*
*on the day Jerusalem fell.*
*“Tear it down,” they cried,*
*“tear it down to its foundations!”*
*8 Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction,*
*happy is the one who repays you*
*according to what you have done to us.*
*9 Happy is the one who seizes your infants*
*and dashes them against the rocks.*

The Edomites were so bad, as well as Babylon, that their punishment from God has been so severe that even seeing one's child being dashed against the rocks would be a happy thing.
