# Psalm 14
*The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good. The Lord looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God. All have turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.* 

*Do all these evildoers know nothing?*

*They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on the Lord. (Psalm 14:1-4 NIV)*

*Anyone* who says there is no a God, is a fool. No matter how nice and friendly you are, how smart or talented, if you do not recognize God's voice and ways, you are a fool.

As long as you do not know Him, or at least know His Law, you have no moral awareness. You cannot do good and neither you are. Even the people who do know Him cannot be good either, let alone those who do not know Him.

Indeed, if God were to look down on Earth, and He is doing so, then He sees corruption in priests, popes, congregation leaders and members, and even more in the secular authorities such as the government, police, and unfortunately even the department of Justice, e.g. judges.

*Psalm 14:4-7 NIV*

*Do all these evildoers know nothing?*

*They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on the Lord .*
*But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is present in the company of the righteous. You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor, but the Lord is their refuge.*
*Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the Lord restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!*

The evildoers do not know their efforts are a waste of time, since God will restore his people anyway.
