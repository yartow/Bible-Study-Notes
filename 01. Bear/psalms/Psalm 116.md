# Psalm 116
*Psalm 116:1-2 NIV*

*I love the Lord , for he heard my voice; he heard my cry for mercy. Because he turned his ear to me, I will call on him as long as I live.*

It is not the cry itself that God hears, not our complaints or our self pity, but the faith we have in crying out *to Him* that makes Him turns His ear to us. 
Yes, I will call on Him as long as I live, because He is the only one I should rely on and out my faith in.

**Psalm 116:3-4 NIV**

*The cords of death entangled me, the anguish of the grave came over me; I was overcome by distress and sorrow. Then I called on the name of the Lord : “ Lord , save me!”*

It is most often that I am on the verge if death, of defeat, that I call on to God. It is not too late, but God would have wanted me to call on him so much sooner.

*Psalm 116:5-6 NIV*

*The Lord is gracious and righteous; our God is full of compassion. The Lord protects the unwary; when I was brought low, he saved me.*

But the Lord is gracious, of course He knew all along my weaknesses, and that I would not call on Him at first, still He was gracious and compassionate, and helped me when I needed it.

*Psalm 116:7-9 NIV*

*Return to your rest, my soul, for the Lord has been good to you.*

My soul is at rest now, I fear not that the Lord will abandon me, no matter how many times I have do wrong, He still forgives me and helps me when I need it.
He knows my weaknesses but does not trample on them.

*For you, Lord , have delivered me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before the Lord in the land of the living.*

It is as David says, You Lord have made sure that I am living, that I do not have sad things to cry about, stumbling blocks to trip over, but rather have a relatively smooth path in the land of the living, that is, with You and Your children.

*Psalm 116:10-12 NIV*

*I trusted in the Lord when I said, “I am greatly afflicted”; in my alarm I said, “Everyone is a liar.”*

Whenever I call on the Lord, I have to mean it. I have to trust Him at all times. Yes there are times, there have been and there will be, that I did not trust anyone and thought that everyone (at least in my surrounding) was unreliable, not really knowing God, or better said, not really understanding me.

*What shall I return to the Lord for all his goodness to me?*

I have to put my trust in Him, that perhaps is one way or returning to Him.

*Psalm 116:13-14 NIV*

*I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord . I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people.*

What do I have to do when I fall down? The answer is written here: I lift up the cup of salvation, which means that he victory has already taken place, though not by me, but it is now given to me and is right in front of me. I keep on going, I fulfill my vows and do it in the presence of the people God has out beside me.

*Psalm 116:15-16 NIV*

*Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his faithful servants. Truly I am your servant, Lord ; I serve you just as my mother did; you have freed me from my chains.*

Death could be literally or figuratively here, although but I agree with. Dying for the Lord is the greatest thing one can do, although living here on Earth for the Lord is hard as well. For me, dying is an escape to a better world, there is nothing more I would like than to see the Lord with my own eyes and ask Him for all the knowledge He has, answers to all the unanswered questions here on Earth, about evolution and creation. Who was right, in the end?
But the Lord "needs me", I wanted to say, but that is not true. He does not *need* me, He can fulfill His plan through others or even without humans. It is I who need Him, yet God is giving me the honor of serving Him and knowing him, and then serving others so that they may get to know Him as well. 
I must teach others about what God has taught me.

Figuratively dying is done by giving up myself, my own thought and longings, and long only for that which God longs for.

I long so much that my Sunday school class children will get to know You, by heart and by mind and by strength and by soul.
*That they* **want** to know You (heart), that they *know how* to know You, how to read the Bible and memorize and have knowledge of you (mind), that they will *do* everything in their power to know (strength) and that they actually feel what You want them to morally *feel* what is right and wrong, and to be able to judge every situation in the right way (soul). 

*Psalm 116:17-19 NIV*

**I will sacrifice a thank offering to you and call on the name of the Lord . I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people, in the courts of the house of the Lord — in your midst, Jerusalem. Praise the Lord .**

Once again, David fulfills his vows in *front of the people*, not to boast, but to give a good example of how a king praises an even higher King. Even as a king David humbles himself before God and never thinks of himself as too great. That is how a man should be, he is thanking God and *calling His Name*. A simple thanks is not enough, God's Name needs to be mentioned.
