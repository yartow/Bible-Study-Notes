# Psalm 100
*1 Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.*
*2 Worship the Lord with gladness;*
*come before him with joyful songs.*
*3 Know that the Lord is God.*
*It is he who made us, and we are his* *[* *[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+100&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-15512a)* *]* *;*
*we are his people, the sheep of his pasture.*

"We are His," is the main text in this verse for me. Our lives are His, we are His people.
We do not praise Him or worship Him because we want to *thank* Him. No, we do it because He owns us. He is our Creator, and also our loving Father.
When we are sad because things in our lives do not happen they way we want them to, we should think once more that it is not our lives, but our attribution to God's Kingdom. If our lives have attributed, we should be happy.
If it does happen the way we want, and we made it happen, then perhaps we should not be happy, because instead of attributing to the Kingdom, we have now attributed to our own life and happiness.

*4 Enter his gates with thanksgiving*
*and his courts with praise;*
*give thanks to him and praise his name.*

Not just today, but every day when I enter His courts, the building you could say, I must be thankful.
Thankful for all the people who have come to help at such an early time, thankful for all the people who want to be part of Your family, thankful for those students who have arrived earlier than I have.
Thankful for the teachers to be willing to teach.

Father, I really do not know what to do with my two (former) teachers. Let me not adhere to postmodernism, most certainly not in the Christian field. Let me be strict in keeping Your Word, yet knowing that loves is included in that. Let me be gentle and forgiving, just like You are, *and carry my fellowman's burdens.*

*5 For the Lord is good and his love endures forever;*
*his faithfulness continues through all generations.*

Yes, Lord, You are good. Let me do good as well. You are faithful, you will not let me or your other children alone.
Help us think of a solution, provide us with Your wisdom. Let us not worry about the problem, but only about how to follow You more.
