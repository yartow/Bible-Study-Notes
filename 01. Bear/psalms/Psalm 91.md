# Psalm 91
*Psalm 91:1-2 NIV*

*Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord , “He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.”*

I need to dwell in the shelter of God, before I can get near Him. If I want His personal protection, I need to go to His house. Is that what this means?
The shelter protects me from storms and enemy attacks, buy His shadow protects me from all of my inner attacks.

*Psalm 91:3-8 NIV*

*Surely he will save you from the fowler’s snare and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday.*

Fear is one of the main attributes of a believer when he has given his life to God, the fear of God or rather the lack of it for anything else.
I truly fear God as I know He alone can take my life away and at the same time He alone can give me eternal life in heaven. God can do immensely more things to scare me than death and give me immensely more pleasure than life.
All other things I fear not, for they are nothing compared to God's greatness and awe, all kinds of fear here on Earth are only tools of the Satan to trick us into following him and abandoning God. But no matter what fear, I must persist in following God because only then will I receive the crown of eternal life.
The blessing I have received of being His child is that I fear nothing anymore, and fear God even more.

*A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you. You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked.*

Apart from fear it is also reality, I see that God really blesses me and punishes, or does not bless, those around me.
Amidst every crisis God provides light and hope and His peace enters my heart.

*9 If you say, “The Lord is my refuge,”*
*and you make the Most High your dwelling,*
*10 no harm will overtake you,*
*no disaster will come near your tent.*

My tent is where my family lives, in other words, it is my house, what is under my care.
God will protect me from disasters in my house, but I must know that a "disaster" in my eyes is not the same as in God's eyes. I must remember that God's ways are above mine.

*11 For he will command his angels concerning you*
*to guard you in all your ways;*

God has angels concerning me, they take care of me and protect me. The many times I have been saved from accidents and maybe deaths are the work of God Who sent His angels, for example to wake me up at the right time when driving.

*12 they will lift you up in their hands,*
*so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.*

You will protect me at all times to not let me be hurt by stones, by things on the low ground, static things that are sharp and dull at the same time, hard, not understanding and not willing to change. Not moving forward either and always getting in the way of those who do want to move forward.
Thank You for letting me see that I was the stone. You always come to aid at the right time, never too late, never too early.

During my argument with Sandra, yesterday, I behaved like a stone. I did not want to listen to her and was not willing to change.
In other words, I was the reason why Sandra could not grow, but also why I could not grow myself.

*13 You will tread on the lion and the cobra;*
*you will trample the great lion and the serpent.*

Not only stones get in my way, but also lions and cobras.
The king of the jungle, which is the king of this world, is also blocking my way, which is the Satan. He is both ruler of the Earth as well as a sneaky advisor to all, the snake, giving bad advice to everyone.
Please block my ears for him, Lord, and let me not fear the Satan.

*Psalm 91:14-16 NIV*

*“Because he loves me,” says the Lord , “I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name.*

The Lord rescues us because we love Him. First, God loved us, and after we learned what love is, we loved Him back. And then God shows us what love is by protecting us.
What we do for God, God will surely do for us as well. If we acknowledge His Name, not *protect* His Name, for that is something we cannot do, God will protect our names, that is, ourselves, as well. 
However, it is not the other way around, that is, if we do not acknowledge His Name, He does *not* protect us. We do not know what God will do in this case, but we have often seen that God takes the initiative in loving and in protecting. 

*He will call on me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him.*

God does imply here that we need to call on Him before He will answer, for an answer can only be to a call. He also says He will be with us in trouble. So if we do not see God, we need to wonder whether we are in trouble.
God will deliver us *and honor us*. Why would he give us honor, what have we done to deserve honor?

A person gets honor for what he has done. All we have done is loving God back, and for that he gives us long life? Yes, God is good, all the time.

*With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.”*

A long life would not mean or be worth anything if I do not enjoy life. But I do enjoy it, that is one of the first gifts God has given me. He also gave me a beautiful life to enjoy, I have everything I need and even more than that. Being able to enjoy all that, and enjoy it for a longer time than I would actually have, is even greater.
God knows best what is best for me.
