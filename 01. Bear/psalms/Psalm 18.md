# Psalm 18
*Psalm 18:1-5 NIV* 

*I love you, Lord , my strength.*
*The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.* 

*I called to the Lord , who is worthy of praise, and I have been saved from my enemies. The cords of death entangled me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me. The cords of the grave coiled around me; the snares of death confronted me.* 

The Lord is strong, just by saying it I am worshipping Him. He is more than just strong, He is always strong, He is the strongest, and He will save and protect.
Not only does He save naturally, He can also save supernaturally, saving me from problems no man could save me from.

*Psalm 18:6-15 NIV* 

*In my distress I called to the Lord ; I cried to my God for help. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came before him, into his ears. The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook; they trembled because he was angry. Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.* 

Not only will my Lord do things for me, He will also feel for me and get angry for me.

*He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet. He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind. He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him— the dark rain clouds of the sky. Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced, with hailstones and bolts of lightning. The Lord thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded. He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy, with great bolts of lightning he routed them. The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at your rebuke, Lord , at the blast of breath from your nostrils.* 

Everything He does is greater than we have ever seen, but for Him it is merely a breath from His nostrils.

*Psalm 18:16-19 NIV* 

*He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters. He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, who were too strong for me. They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the Lord was my support. He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me.* 

My Lord reaches for me, He is the One doing the hard work. No matter how many foes I have or how strong they are. He gives me freedom and space to relax in. Moreover, He rescued me not because of what I have done, but only because He, delighted in me.

*The Lord has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.* 

*For I have kept the ways of the Lord; I am not guilty of turning from my God.*
*All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees.*
*I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin.* 

*The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight. (Psalm 18:20-24 NIV)*

David is repeating the first sentence at the end, which means he wants to emphasize the middle part.
In the middle he repeats the same meaning twice, to emphasize
1. He has always done his best to keep the Law
2. He has always stood before God and put Him at the first place.

Though the first and last sentence seem similar, they differ in two points:
1. The Lord has dealt with David, and has also rewarded David according to his righteousness. That is fair, or righteous, to give someone what he deserves.
2. The Lord deals according to David's cleanness, however, rewarding He does according to David's "cleanness in His sight”. God is very strict to give us not any more punishment than we deserve, but He often if not always rewards us more than we deserve.

*Psalm 18:25-29 NIV*

*To the faithful you show yourself faithful,*
*to the blameless you show yourself blameless,*
*to the pure you show yourself pure,*
*but to the devious you show yourself shrewd.*

*You save the humble but bring low those whose eyes are haughty.*

*You, Lord , keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light.*
*With your help I can advance against a troop ; with my God I can scale a wall.* 

Drie keer laat David zien hoe goed God is, en één keer hoe streng Hij is tegen de slechten, op het gebied van zonden.

Op het gebied van nederigheid, erg nadrukkelijk in het midden gezet, krijgen de nederigen niet zozeer een beloning, maar ze worden gespaard, wat al beloning genoeg is.

Daarna komt een stuk waarin David duidelijk het contrast laat zien tussen praten tegen de lezer en tegen God.
Wat hij vertelt over God, is hetzelfde als wat hij ons vertelt, maar door zijn persoonlijk gesprek met God te laten zien, voelen we beter zijn emotie.

*Psalm 18:30-36 NIV*

*As for God, his way is perfect: The Lord ’s word is flawless; he shields all who take refuge in him.*

We should always assume God is perfect and thus His ways as well.

*For who is God besides the Lord ? And who is the Rock except our God? It is God who arms me with strength and keeps my way secure.*

*No one can do the things God does. He can, and He does.*

*He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he causes me to stand on the heights. He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze. You make your saving help my shield, and your right hand sustains me; your help has made me great. You provide a broad path for my feet, so that my ankles do not give way.*

We should also always assume God has the best intentions for us.

*Psalm 18:37-45 NIV*

*I pursued my enemies and overtook them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed. I crushed them so that they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet.*

God can give so much power, we can keep on going. Not a little bit, but the whole victory is ours.

*You armed me with strength for battle; you humbled my adversaries before me. You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.*

Normally God would not help you out in battle, because He does not like war. But if it is for the cause of God, He will even arm you. Moreover, He will do something we cannot do: humbling our adversaries. He helps us destroy His enemies.

*They cried for help, but there was no one to save them— to the Lord , but he did not answer.*

I know that in the end the Lord will listen to me, because I have been honest and righteous.

*I beat them as fine as windblown dust; I trampled them like mud in the streets. You have delivered me from the attacks of the people; you have made me the head of nations. People I did not know now serve me, foreigners cower before me; as soon as they hear of me, they obey me. They all lose heart; they come trembling from their strongholds.*

What was deemed impossible before, now is happening before my eyes, and all of it is because of God. Not only did I beat my enemies (which are God's enemies as well) but He let me beat them big.

*Psalm 18:46-50 NIV*

*The Lord lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God my Savior! He is the God who avenges me, who subdues nations under me, who saves me from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from a violent man you rescued me. Therefore I will praise you, Lord , among the nations; I will sing the praises of your name.*

God does not only save me, He avenges me.

*He gives his king great victories; he shows unfailing love to his anointed, to David and to his descendants forever.*
