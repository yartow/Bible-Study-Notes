# Psalm 71
*Psalm 71:1-4 NIV*

*In you, Lord , I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame. In your righteousness, rescue me and deliver me; turn your ear to me and save me.*

I surrender myself to You, Lord, and long to be rescued in Your time and according to Your righteousness.
Let me not be put to shame, it is so hard to admit sometimes that I am a Christian, afraid that things get awkward, or that I will give a wrong representation of You.

*Be my rock of refuge, to which I can always go;*

I know I can always come to You, You give me comfort, You forgive me, no matter how many times I have sinned. You *have* forgiven me already for every single sin I am going to commit, by loving me unconditionally. 

*give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.*

It is under Your command that I am saved. If You do not give the command, I am not saved. It is as simple as that.
The wicked and evil listen to You, for You are mighty, much mightier than them! Let me never forget that.

*Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of those who are evil and cruel.*

Yes, Lord, deliver me for evil has grasped me once again. It will not let go, or perhaps the evil within me will not let go.

*Psalm 71:5-8 NIV*

*For you have been my hope, Sovereign Lord , my confidence since my youth. From birth I have relied on you; you brought me forth from my mother’s womb. I will ever praise you.*

From birth on, as far as I can remember, You have always been there to protect me. My oldest memory of You is that of You driving evil spirits away.
How can it be, that when I was so sure You have protected me and that I did not need to be afraid, I still was so afraid of so many things? It is because I got lost along the way, I forgot about You and that is why things turned bad in my life.
I forgot about what you had done for me, the miracles, Your power and might, and Your protection. But during all these years I see You have protected me by not having the wrong friends and residing in the wrong places, attending the right schools and getting good education in sports, music, school and especially theology.

*I have become a sign to many; you are my strong refuge. My mouth is filled with your praise, declaring your splendor all day long.*

What this part means is that I have become a sign to many that You are good, and that You are a refuge. But I want to add to that, that I am an example as well as for how to live my life in service for You. Praising God for all things is one of those things, but living a good life is that as well.

*Psalm 71:9-13 NIV*

*Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone.*

Lord, You know that I am still young and have confidence in myself. When I get older and weaker I hope to rely more and more on You, so that Your power may be glorified in my weakness.
Let me not start on that when I am old, but let it start right now.
Perhaps David knew he would become weaker as he got older and was afraid that You would leave him. Then he really would not have anything at all anymore. No health, no friends, no God, no one on his side.
I thank You, Lord, for Your promise to always be with us, especially when we are weak.

*For my enemies speak against me; those who wait to kill me conspire together. They say, “God has forsaken him; pursue him and seize him, for no one will rescue him.”*

I cannot see my enemies and I am prone to paranoia. Let me not see my friends as enemies nor my fiends as friends. Give me Your wisdom to distinguish, to test and approve who are my real friends.

*Do not be far from me, my God; come quickly, God, to help me. May my accusers perish in shame; may those who want to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace.*

The reason I want my pursuers to be in shame is because they hoped that I would fail. However, I have not, or at least I have gotten back on my feet, and I want them to see this and to know that it was only because of You.
Let them change when they realize this.

*Psalm 71:14 NIV*

*As for me, I will always have hope; I will praise you more and more.*

Father, you have shown me more and more of Your glory. We thank You for all the blessings You have given us.
Our house and everything needed for it has been given by You. If You were to take it back, we can accept that more easily now, because we have seen with our own eyes how wonderful and mighty You are.
You are able to give and take away just as fast.
Forgive me when I have not put enough faith in You or prayed often enough for it.
I pray to You that I will never forget the deeds You have done for us, so that I will always have hope and praise You more and more, every day.

*Psalm 71:15-18 NIV*

*My mouth will tell of your righteous deeds, of your saving acts all day long— though I know not how to relate them all.*

Does David mean that He has heard of some of God's saving acts, but cannot feel it?

*I will come and proclaim your mighty acts, Sovereign Lord ; I will proclaim your righteous deeds, yours alone.*

This means I will not proclaim any deeds of other people. What others do *seems* righteous, but only what God does not really *is* righteous. 

*Since my youth, God, you have taught me, and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds.*

There has not been a moment that You have not been without me. Even when I was not aware of Your presence or not appreciating it. How much more so now, now I want You to be with me, have asked You to be with me and appreciate it all the more since I have experienced times far away from You.
To this day I still remember some of the marvelous things you have done for me. No matter how long ago.

*Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, my God, till I declare your power to the next generation, your mighty acts to all who are to come.*

I use testimonies of Your mighty acts to instruct the next generation. Give me knowledge and wisdom, and a good memory to recite the many deeds You have done for me and Your children.

*Psalm 71:19-21 NIV*

*Your righteousness, God, reaches to the heavens, you who have done great things. Who is like you, God? Though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter, you will restore my life again; from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up. You will increase my honor and comfort me once more.*

Your righteousness is so great we cannot fathom. You restore us after bad things have happened to us, yet these bad things are things we deserved as well.

*Psalm 71:22-24 NIV*

*I will praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God; I will sing praise to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel. My lips will shout for joy when I sing praise to you— I whom you have delivered.*

When was the last time I have really praised God, being thankful as if my life had just been saved? I cannot remember, perhaps it was a job interview or an exam I passed.
Forgive me, Father, the reason I am so blind to Your blessings is because You have blessed me so much, so much that I have gotten used to it and no longer feel the appreciation in my heart.
But You have done such great things for me. Every month that I survive in my financial situation is because of You. I never have too little and more than often too much.
Every day I survive spiritually, because You call me back and fend off the devil. Without You I would be in His power already.

*My tongue will tell of your righteous acts all day long, for those who wanted to harm me have been put to shame and confusion.*

When was the last time I have told of Your righteous acts? Give me courage to do so, and wisdom not to hurt my fellowmen.
