# Psalm 38
*Psalm 38:1-4 NIV*

*Lord , do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.*
*Your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down on me.*
*Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; there is no soundness in my bones because of my sin.*
*My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear.*

Dear Father, I know what David is speaking of and I know how much a sin can lay weight on my body. Therefore I am the more grateful for Your mercy, for after all the that I have done wrong, sinned to You and my fellowmen, You have only relatively laid this burden upon my shoulders.

*Psalm 38:5-8 NIV*

*My wounds fester and are loathsome because of my sinful folly. I am bowed down and brought very low; all day long I go about mourning.*

You, Lord, have not created man to be sinful and therefore the body of man will be destroyed when it is loaded with sin.
Every sin not forgiven, not spoken out and healed will fester and become worse. It will become part of your life, regret and sorrow will occur more frequently.
But I thank You that You have forgiven my sins, so I can now fully stand straight before You.

*My back is filled with searing pain; there is no health in my body. I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.*

At these moments I have no energy at all. I did not care about my school, my career or money.

*Psalm 38:9-12 NIV*

*All my longings lie open before you, Lord; my sighing is not hidden from you.*
*My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light has gone from my eyes.*

*My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds;*
*my neighbors stay far away.*

*Those who want to kill me set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin; all day long they scheme and lie.*

I am so tired that I do not even care anymore who sees my sorrows and pain. I have nothing to hide and I do not think anyone can solve my problems. Sometimes I do not even think You can. Forgive me for having thought that.

My lack of pleasure in life has made me push away or ignored my friends.
Fortunately there was no one to trap me and kill me, or I would have been dead already.

You protected me Lord, You always have, but especially in those moments that I could not protect myself.

*Psalm 38:13-14 NIV*

*I am like the deaf, who cannot hear, like the mute, who cannot speak; I have become like one who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply.*

If I have sinned, it is as if I cannot reply, because everything I say will be held against me. Who am I to say anything about anyone else, when I have sinned? What authority of speaking do I have about sins, if I cannot even restrain myself

*Psalm 38:15-16 NIV*

*Lord , I wait for you; you will answer, Lord my God.*
*For I said, “Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my feet slip.”*

David has asked something of You, that You protect him when he falls, that other enemies will not scavenge over him.
And it is not that You will obey anyone, but David knows you will answer, and that is what he is waiting for.
I know You will answer my prayers as well. At this moment I do not know what to choose now or where the future will lead me in my career. The best option might not even be the best, if You want to bring me somewhere else. It is so hard, Lord, and therefore I am asking You, please help me, give me peace in my heart and mind to make the right choices.
You have placed feelings in my heart for a reason, I ask You to give these a place in my life. Not to be manipulated or to be over sensitive, or to be sympathetic in business relations, but to listen to my feelings only if they are given by You.

*Psalm 38:17-20 NIV*

*For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me.*
*I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.*

I am at this point where I will not even bother to withhold any truth, I am ready to confess all the wrong that I have done. I know that is a sign of weakness in the world, but to You that is a sign of surrendering to You, and letting You take over my life.

I was so upset or sorrowful that I did not care about anyone, especially strangers. But in this way I made enemies. Little did I know that this sorrow expands through every bit of myself.

*Many have become my enemies without cause ; those who hate me without reason are numerous.*

It happened just that way. People flock together, they like to be together to make one scapegoat, point at someone who did something wrong, even if it was not against them.
You see it in the story of the adulterous woman, where everyone wants to judge her, though they have nothing to do with her.
Stoning is a sad event and people should not be delighted to be able to throw a stone. That is just how the world is. We just do not see that we are like that ourselves as well.

*Those who repay my good with evil lodge accusations against me, though I seek only to do what is good.*

I still tried to do good, but I could not, because I was too far away from You. I knew not what You really wanted, my prayers did not reach You.
But I know now that they have, for I am now in front of You.

*Psalm 38:21-22 NIV*

*Lord , do not forsake me; do not be far from me, my God.*
*Come quickly to help me, my Lord and my Savior.*

I should not forget to call on the Lord, not too late and as early as possible.
If I ask Him not to be too far from me, I should not dwell too far from Him either.
