# Psalm 150
*Praise the Lord . Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in his mighty heavens.*

Praise the Lord, wherever He is resided, in His sanctuary or in His mighty heavens, he is to be exalted everywhere. He looks upon from every angle.
The smallest things are visible to Him, even the invisible things. The smallest people, the people least worth anything. Our emotions and feelings, no matter whether we hide them or crop them up, You see them all. Not only are You Almighty and all-powerful, You are also caring for all.

*Praise him for his acts of power; praise him for his surpassing greatness. Praise him with the sounding of the trumpet, praise him with the harp and lyre, praise him with timbrel and dancing, praise him with the strings and pipe, praise him with the clash of cymbals, praise him with resounding cymbals.*

The Lord is worthy to be praised, and being praised with all kinds of instruments. His acts of power and surpassing greatness cannot be simulated by any instrument, but the clashing and resounding of cymbals and the sounding of the trumpet might show a little bit of that.
The volume and cheerfulness of the timbrel and dancing with the whole body shows how happy we are to be praising the Lord our God.
We are fortunate to have even more instruments in this day and age to praise Him in many more ways.

*Let everything that has breath praise the Lord . Praise the Lord .*
*Psalm 150:1-6 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.150.1-6.NIV*

Even instruments that do not have breath can be used to praise the Lord, how much more our bodies that breathe the air that the Lord has given us?
