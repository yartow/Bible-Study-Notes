# Psalm 81
*Psalm 81:1-2 NIV*

*Sing for joy to God our strength; shout aloud to the God of Jacob! Begin the music, strike the timbrel, play the melodious harp and lyre.*

Do not forget, *never* forget, to praise God and make music for Him. 
For what reason? He is strong!

*Psalm 81:3-5 NIV*

*Sound the ram’s horn at the New Moon, and when the moon is full, on the day of our festival; this is a decree for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob. When God went out against Egypt, he established it as a statute for Joseph.*

The emphasis of this part is that praising God is a decree, an ordinance, a statute and the first thing to do when you arrive in a new country.

*I heard an unknown voice say:*

*Psalm 81:6-10 NIV*

*“I removed the burden from their shoulders; their hands were set free from the basket. In your distress you called and I rescued you, I answered you out of a thundercloud; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Hear me, my people, and I will warn you—*

If we listen to God, He will warn us. Note that a warning is a gift from God, a priceless advice, and also a way to show His patience.

*if you would only listen to me, Israel! You shall have no foreign god among you; you shall not worship any god other than me. I am the Lord your God, who brought you up out of Egypt. Open wide your mouth and I will fill it.*

God reminds us of what He has done for us. He set us free, He delivered us, He answered us.
Also, He warned us and He gave us promises. Promises so simple as to only open our mouths.
The Israelites only had to seize the land the Lord had given them, and they would get it. They did not, and waited forty years.
After forty years they only had to fight the other countries according to the rules God had given them, but they did not listen, and instead kept plunder to themselves and took home wives of peoples that worship other gods. So they lost many wars and many men, and did not obtain the land they should have.
After living in the land, they could have enjoyed it, but forgot about the Laws that God gave them through Moses, so the Lord let them suffer until they called on Him. But afterwards they neglected the Lord again and began building idols and worshipping them. Of course because they had seen other peoples doing that, and that is because they did not kill them, as God instructed.
They could have enjoyed the Promised Land even more, if they did not ask for a king, who introduced idols and paganism (Solomon), used tax money to build pagan temples and left the people in poverty (son of Solomon), brought famine and drought to the country (Achab) and killed their children (Herod the Great) and made sure they were banished to Babylon and dispersed in the diaspora.

*Psalm 81:11-12 NIV*

*“But my people would not listen to me; Israel would not submit to me. So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own devices.*

After so many gifts for miracles, warnings and even more promises for even greater gifts, the people of Israel would not listen.
So God let them have what they wanted in order to show them what the result was.
Whatever man desires only leads to destruction, only what God desires leads to infinity, that is infinite peace and love.

*Psalm 81:13-16 NIV*

*“If my people would only listen to me, if Israel would only follow my ways, how quickly I would subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes!*

How *quickly* God wants us to follow His ways. Every second that we are in sin, God is sad for human being. God is eager to turn His hand against our foes, but slow to anger. 

*Those who hate the Lord would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever.*

See how big the differences are between those who are opposed to God and those who are with God.
Those who hate the Lord *cringe* and do so *forever*. 

*But you would be fed with the finest of wheat; with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”*

But those who are with God are *satisfied* with he *finest* of wheat and honey.
