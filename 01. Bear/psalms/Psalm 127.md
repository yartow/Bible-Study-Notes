# Psalm 127
*http://bible.com/111/psa.127.1-2.niv*
*Unless* *the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain. In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat— for he grants sleep to those he loves.*

In everything we try to build, our career, our family or life (work), You are deciding whether we succeed or not. You must build it, not we, we must trust in You. We must work hard, yes, but You are doing the work.
You are also protecting Your work. So however hard we are trying to keep what we have, it is all futile, in vain, if You do not watch over it.

*http://bible.com/111/psa.127.3-5.niv*
*Children are a heritage from the Lord , offspring a reward from him.*

If we can have children, it is like a "talent" we have inherited from God, the talent to have children. Although it is rather a gift of being able to conceive. It is not something we worked for, but it is something given to us because God is our Father and He is the creator.
Apparently children and offspring are the same, but I can see a small difference. I may have children but no offspring, I may have offspring, but not through my biological children.
I perceive offspring as the people bringing forth my principles and standards to life.

*Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are children born in one’s youth. Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their opponents in court.*

You have given me one son, and that is more that enough. You have given me tens of children in my class room to whom I can pass on Your Word.
I am truly blessed to have this honor of bringing forth many children into Your Kingdom, to bring many hearts into believing and following You, or to help them when they are on the wrong path.

These children will not be put to shame when they are contending with their enemies, for they know Your Word and have learned to defend it. Of course, all of this is only of significance if they have received Your Spirit as well.
