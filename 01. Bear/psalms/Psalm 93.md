# Psalm 93
*Psalm 93*
*1 The Lord reigns, he is robed in majesty;*
*the Lord is robed in majesty and armed with strength;*
*indeed, the world is established, firm and secure.*
*2 Your throne was established long ago;*
*you are from all eternity.*

Whatever way I look at it, in this Psalm or anywhere else in the Bible or what is written about You by those who have met You, You are glory upon glory.
You are not only a King, You also are strong and the only One fitted to be King of this world. Not just today, but You have always been.
Even right now, at this very moment, You know what is best for me, what I am troubled with and what I need to be comforted.

You let me go through troubles, because You are a personal God. You do not only want to show me Your miracles and power, Your wisdom and strength, You want to show me Your love and mercy as well.

*Psalm 93:3-4 NIV*

*The seas have lifted up, Lord , the seas have lifted up their voice; the seas have lifted up their pounding waves. Mightier than the thunder of the great waters, mightier than the breakers of the seaâ€” the Lord on high is mighty.*

Once again the largest thing we can imagine here on Earth is compared with God and is stunningly crushed by God.
The sea is the largest thing we know of. Everything fits in it, even whales.
The waves of the sea are one of the most the scary phenomenons mankind has ever seen. Not only is it like a voice, but it is pounding, and when it pounds and when the waves crash, you are not certain whether it is the sound of the waves or of thunder.
I have seen ships so large I was out of breath just by getting on it using the stairs. I have seen containers of forty feet and hundreds of those stacked together with stackers each weighing ten pounds and made of the sturdiest metal. But one ride across the ocean, one storm and containers were smashed from the deck, other containers were bend or broken like wooden boards, and all of that just by a little bit of water.

The Lord God Almighty truly is magnificent and worthy of awe.
The fact alone that He can withstand such great powers makes Him awesome.
The Babylonians were foolish enough to create a tower that supposedly could withstand the power of the seas. I am telling You, it could not and never would have. God could have destroyed the tower with just one flick of His fingers or even less action than that.

He created the ocean with just His Word. What could happen if He were to use His hands?

*Psalm 93:5 NIV*

*Your statutes, Lord , stand firm; holiness adorns your house for endless days.*

Your statutes are like jewels on my house and on my body. Without them I feel naked, with them I feel covered and free to go. They protect me and give me guidance.

One more thing, I know that I will never lose these jewels, no thief will ever steal them from me, as long as I have these inscribed in my heart.
