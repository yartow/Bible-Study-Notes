# Psalm 88
*Psalm 88:1-5 NIV*

*Lord , you are the God who saves me; day and night I cry out to you. May my prayer come before you; turn your ear to my cry.*

Thank You, Lord, that You have spared me from the feelings and hardships that David has, that I have never been in such hard situations where I felt like You did not hear me, or at least not ones that I clearly remember.

*I am overwhelmed with troubles and my life draws near to death. I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I am like one without strength. I am set apart with the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom you remember no more, who are cut off from your care.*

Yes, I admit, I have troubles, but I I am nowhere near death. I do not have visible enemies (at this moment), but I know I am saved and that Your Spirit lives within me, and therefore I know You will not cut me off from Your care.
Rather it is that I see more and more of your care the closer I get to You.

*Psalm 88:6-9 NIV*

*You have put me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths. Your wrath lies heavily on me; you have overwhelmed me with all your waves.*

I do understand the feeling however of when all bad things (seem to) happen at once. It is then like a wave that lasts forever and from which I cannot submerge, neither I can breathe.

*You have taken from me my closest friends*

If You take me away from my closest friends, I think it either means that I should walk this path on my own, or that my friends are no good friends. Of course You know what is best for me and what the real reason is. I do not need to know, unless You want me to know.
All I ask for is to obtain Your peace in my heart, Your strength to continue and Your love for on the way when I meet other people.

*and have made me repulsive to them.*

Not only do I not have friends, they repel me, which can only mean that we are not on the same side anymore.
Thank You, Lord, for bringing me on the good side, on Your side. Help my friends please to get to this side as well.

*I am confined and cannot escape; my eyes are dim with grief. I call to you, Lord , every day; I spread out my hands to you.*

At this moment, that David experiences, he cannot escape his sadness or see any way out. Please let this be a reminder to me that when I think there is no way out, it is only because my eyes are dimmed with grief.
Let me keep calling out to You, as David did.

*Psalm 88:10-12 NIV*

*Do you show your wonders to the dead? Do their spirits rise up and praise you? Is your love declared in the grave, your faithfulness in Destruction ? Are your wonders known in the place of darkness, or your righteous deeds in the land of oblivion?*

The people who cannot or did not see Your wonders, are in different realms than we are. They did not see Your wonders because they chose to be on the wrong side.
Is there no way then to convert a person, fully convinced of his own theories? No, not without your miracles. Only through the heart can one change, and only You can change the heart.

*Psalm 88:13-14 NIV*

*But I cry to you for help, Lord ; in the morning my prayer comes before you. Why, Lord , do you reject me and hide your face from me?*

Your ways are higher than my ways and perhaps Your answer to why things happen as they do, I cannot understand.
Even in those moments, please help me, Lord, to keep on praying in the morning. Giving You the best and first portion of my day, that I may worship You with a clean conscience.

*Psalm 88:15-18 NIV*

*From my youth I have suffered and been close to death; I have borne your terrors and am in despair. Your wrath has swept over me; your terrors have destroyed me. All day long they surround me like a flood; they have completely engulfed me.*

Does David mean by suffering from his youth the parts where Saul tried to persecute him?
In any case, David was trained to be a king, and training for a king is harsher than for the people without big responsibilities.
David was tested to the level of not having any friends anymore, although I do not know whether he was exaggerating. But a king must have been through these tests, because a king must not be influence by his friends and prove that he is strong enough to make decisions by himself, relying on God's wisdom only, or even when God does not speak to him.

Saul did not have this patience and could not wait for Samuel, and therefore failed.
David patiently waited until God restored peace in his kingdom (ref. 12:17).

*You have taken from me friend and neighborâ€” darkness is my closest friend.*

Perhaps David means this cynically, but part of it is true. Sometimes one needs to by by himself, in isolation of the world, without friends to influence him, with loneliness to let him consider an reconsider what he already has, or what he should do.
