# Psalm 60
*Psalm 60:1-4 NIV*

*You have rejected us, God, and burst upon us; you have been angry—now restore us! You have shaken the land and torn it open; mend its fractures, for it is quaking. You have shown your people desperate times; you have given us wine that makes us stagger. But for those who fear you, you have raised a banner to be unfurled against the bow.*

Is David speaking on behalf of his people, but not for himself? Then why did God let them win the war?

*Psalm 60:5-8 NIV*

*Save us and help us with your right hand, that those you love may be delivered. God has spoken from his sanctuary: “In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Sukkoth. Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah is my scepter. Moab is my washbasin, on Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”*

God owns the world and He can use it however He wants to. People may rebel because they think it is their land, but if God gives it to His children, or if He decides to burn it, it is His choice.

*Psalm 60:9-12 NIV*

*Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? Is it not you, God, you who have now rejected us and no longer go out with our armies?*

I assume David has to fight against the Edomites, but unexpectedly God appears, even though God said He would not help, or David thought God would not help because of the sin of the people.
God is merciful, He forgives us our sin. Sometimes this means there are consequences as well, but at other times He even wipes these away, because He is merciful.

*Give us aid against the enemy, for human help is worthless. With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies.*

Please God, do not ever let us forget that we need Your help. We can do, so little, I wanted to say, but no, it is nothing, without You, and we can do so much or anything, with You.
