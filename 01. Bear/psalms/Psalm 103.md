# Psalm 103
*Psalm 103:1-5 NIV*

*Praise the Lord , my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name. Praise the Lord , my soul, and forget not all his benefits—*

My whole being, both on the outside as on the inside must praise His holy Name. Every part of me must be thankful to Him for being alive.
At this moment it is hard to say what part of me praises Him because I am so full of worries about money and the renovation of my house. What is said, is true: worry keeps away God's blessings.
Dear Lord, let me not worry about any of these insignificant things. Help me to resolve these, not by focusing on them, but by focusing on You and Your Word.
Help me get closer to You and from this starting point, solve my problems in the hope that You will provide.

*who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion,*

Since He has done all these things for me, I have to do these to my neighbors as well.

*who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.*

It is so shameful, God renews my youth, He satisfies my desires with good things, He redeems me, even though I am sinful and diseased with many kinds of sinful addictions, totally impure by the sins of this world. Yet He loves me and has compassion for me, even though it is the so manieth time I have sinned, He still forgives me.

*Psalm 103:6 NIV*

*The Lord works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.*

The oppressed should be extra thankful, for they will get righteousness and justice from the Lord Himself, which is worth more than from any human.

*Psalm 103:7-12 NIV*

*He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel: The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.*

This is the way He showed Moses how to behave, slow to anger and abounding in love.
Teach me this, Lord, this is by far the best thing I can learn. Let me not hold up any wrath in me, let me be honest and not put up a mask of humility.

*He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever;*

The Lord is much gentler than I am. He does not always accuse as I do. As soon as I see someone doing something wrong, I accuse them and forget that I was wrong too and needed God's mercy.
He will not harbor his anger forever, and neither must I. I must forgive those who have wronged me.

*he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.*

All of us should be punished, none of us is right, but God does not treat us as harsh as He may.

*For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him; as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.*

He not only forgives us, He never looks back at our sins again. Any normal human being would lose faith in another after being lied to so many times. We promise the Lord our God to change our behavior, and yet we sin the very next day.
But God gives us new hope, He strengthens us, *every day!* He forgives us our sins every day, and He removes our sins every day. 
This is unfathomable for people.

*Psalm 103:13-18 NIV*

~*As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him; for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust.*~

The Lord understands us like no one else does, not even we ourselves. He created us, He created our thoughts, our character, our body and mind. He knows our strengths and our weaknesses. That is why the Lord has compassion on us, for He knows we are weak and with which problems we are coping.

*The life of mortals is like grass, they flourish like a flower of the field; the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more.*

Perhaps God is telling me that the work I have done in organizing the summer conference is gone like it is blown with the wind.
My strategies, working methods amount to nothing over time. People change, our target group changes, different methods are needed.

*But from everlasting to everlasting the Lord ’s love is with those who fear him, and his righteousness with their children’s children— with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts.*

But what is everlasting is the Lord's love. His love that has reached the summer conference, that many people have felt and accepted, is still living inside them.
Of course, only those willing to live by it will remember these.

*Psalm 103:19 NIV*

*The Lord has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all.*

The Lord's throne is higher than anything. His ruling is higher than any other ruler, no one overrules Him, He even makes the rules and He Himself is the definition of what is good and what love is.
His Kingdom rules over all, that means not just every country, but also every piece of land on Earth and on every other planet, even where no one lives.

And within every person all of it is under the Lord's reign. The body, the mind and the soul. Every thought of man is known by God, every intention whether good or bad, and every act and treatment on another and on one's own body.

*Psalm 103:20-22 NIV*

*Praise the Lord , you his angels, you mighty ones who do his bidding, who obey his word.*
*Praise the Lord , all his heavenly hosts, you his servants who do his will.*
*Praise the Lord , all his works everywhere in his dominion.*
*Praise the Lord , my soul.*

It seems as if there is more than angels in heaven, because this Psalm speaks of heavenly hosts as well, and this is most probably not the stars and planets, because it says "you servants." Perhaps these are cherubims or the like.
If that is true, I see an order in here, first the mighty ones, the angels, then the heavenly hosts, then all of his works, and finally our souls.
This last line, however, is also the ending line of this block, and of the whole Psalm.
Note then that the line before this block is introduced by a statement in verse 19:*The Lord has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all.*
Which could indicate that this block is to show what "all" really means. Thus not just humans, but angels as well, not just us, but our souls as well.
