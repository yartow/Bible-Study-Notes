# Psalms 27 (ESV) 
**The LORD Is My Light and My Salvation**
*OF DAVID.*
*1 The LORD is my light and my salvation;*
*whom shall I fear?*
*The LORD is the stronghold of my life;*
*of whom shall I be afraid?*

If there is a difference between *fearing something* and *being afraid of something*, fear would be being afraid paired with respect, while being afraid merely means just that. In v.1a when David speaks that he does not fear anyone because he has light and salvation, I would have chosen being **afraid** instead of **fear**. For when there is no **light**, one might be afraid of something in the dark, but this has nothing to do with respect, and when one does not have **salvation**, one might be afraid of where one will drift to and this too is not related at all to respect. In the second part of this verse the **LORD is the stronghold** of David, which means that David looks up to God, as the strong and stable Person in his life, with *respect*. Yet strangely enough he uses **be afraid** here. 
This could be a poetic interference #todo/opzoeken/engels as is often done in poetry. In the Christian music band #tags/famouspeople/christian *Casting Crowns*' song *Who am I* there is a line that goes as follows. 

> *Not because of who I am,*  
> *But because of what You've done.*  
> *Not because of what I've done*   
> *But because of who You are.*  

David's poetic interference is different but this technique is done in multiple places in the Bible #todo/opzoeken showing that our God—from Whom David received this gift—is a poetic God with a feel or literature and creativity—*being* the Creator of it, this was expected of course. 

*2 When evildoers assail me*
*to eat up my flesh,*
*my adversaries and foes,*
*it is they who stumble and fall.*

There are two ways to interpret this verse: (1) when the **evildoers** *try* to **assail** David they will fail, for they will **stumble and fall** in their attempts. The other interpretation is that (2) David's **adversaries and foes** will succeed in eating his **flesh**, but after doing so, God will avenge them and they will **fall** anyway. So either way, we may rest in the thought that those attacking God's anointed—and that counts for those too who are in Christ (cf. Colossians 3:3)—will be led to their downfall.

*3 ::Though an army encamp against me,*::
::*my heart shall not fear;*::
*though war arise against me,*
*yet I will be confident.*

The first time I encountered this verse was when a friend used this verse as his tagline in MSN Messenger (Footnote: *MSN Messenger* was a chat program used in the 2000s before people had instant message apps such as WhatsApp.). I was strengthened and confirmed in my faith because this person was not afraid of showing he was a Christian, aside from the contents of this verse. But now, reading the contents of it as well, I am confirmed even more that I should not be afraid to speak of my faith, to stand up for Christ and be confident of His power.  

::*4 One thing have I asked of the LORD,*::
::*that will I seek after:*::
::*that I may dwell in the house of the LORD*::
::*all the days of my life,*::
::*to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD*::
::*and to inquire in his temple.*:: #biblestudy/memorization/todo

What constitutes beauty? Some would say outer appearance, others would say it is the inner appearance. 1 Peter 3:9 tells women—but this counts for men as well—that we should not let our adorning be external, but be in the hidden person. In the case of God we do not even have an external appearance to look at, so all we can is to look at His hidden Person. 

There are many things we have asked of the Lord, which we did not receive. This is not only because we were doubting God and being double-minded (James 1:5-8) which could mean that we want two things at the same time. I know, for example, a person who wants great riches so that he can give his great riches to God, but at the same time he wants to be left with (more than) enough money so that he can get by comfortably. 
There is, however, only one thing we should ask, which constitutes all of the advantages of heaven, which is being near God. A true Christian does not want heaven because there is no more pain and suffering, or because they will meet with lost loved ones or to get the answers to all of history's unanswered questions. No, a Christian wants to go to heaven to meet God and be with Him, to serve Him as a lowly servant, kneeling down while saying "holy is the Lord Almighty" all the time, without ceasing. 
This is what David has **asked of the LORD**. When he says **all the days of my life** he does not mean his earthly life, but rather his whole life on earth and on heaven and—if he knew about it—life on the New Earth as well. David not only seeks God's beautiful face, but he also mentions the reason *why* in the verses thereafter. These might sound egocentric, for these are about **shelter in the day of trouble** and for his **head** to **be lifted up above** his **enemies**. However, these troubles are things that happen on Earth. It is *because* of what God has done for David here on Earth that he is looking for God and that **in his temple** and in heaven—where there is no temple, but perhaps David assumed so—he **inquires** for nothing more than the **beauty of the LORD**. 

*5 For he will hide me in his shelter*
*in the day of trouble;*
*he will conceal me under the cover of his tent;*
*he will lift me high upon a rock.*
*6 And now my head shall be lifted up*
*above my enemies all around me,*
*and I will offer in his tent*
*sacrifices with shouts of joy;*
*I will sing and make melody to the LORD.*

As mentioned before, the **for** mentioned here, might pose a problem of conditional love of David for God, when interpreted wrongly. It might refer to v.4, i.e. David asks but **one thing**: to **dwell in the house of the Lord**... *because* God has hidden and protected him in His tent. However, this poem should be understood from a human perspective. If anyone says: "This is where I want to be, because that is where I am safe", he is making a conditional statement, even though morally there is nothing wrong about this statement. This is because our *human* love is conditional *by definition of the Bible*, for God loved us first (cf. John 3:16, Romans 5:8, 8:29 #todo/opzoeken andere references) and sought us first ( #todo/opzoeken  for there is none that seeketh God), after which we sought Him, found Him (because He let Himself be found, by revealing Himself, cf. Isaiah 65:1-2). This is how we love God in return. He created us, he gave us all the blessings of the Earth, even with sin conquering it, and appreciating all that—which only happens through the Holy Spirit—we love Him. 

*7 Hear, O LORD, when I cry aloud;*
*be gracious to me and answer me!*
*8 You have said, “Seek my face.”*
*My heart says to you,*
*“Your face, LORD, do I seek.”*

*9 Hide not your face from me.*
*Turn not your servant away in anger,*
*O you who have been my help.*
*Cast me not off; forsake me not,*
*O God of my salvation!*

Would David have been afraid that God would actually do such a thing? Of course. Even though he loved God with all of his heart and knew Him better than any of us do, he also knew how holy God was. 
There were times when David sinned and offended God seriously such that other people died, such as in the case of Bathsheba (cf. Psalm 51 where his son died due to his sin) and when he counted his army (#todo/opzoeken ) and when he did not act like a father should, and his two eldest sons were killed. These sins were enough that others should die for David's sin—and God is still righteous in not killing David but others—but God is also righteous when He forsakes David because of these sins. In fact, He is righteous if forsakes any person here on Earth, no matter how God they have lived! 
However, my question is more pointed at David's fears that are shown in this verse. Would David not have any confidence that God would not leave Him? Or are we perhaps too confident that God will let His Holy Spirit remain in us? Or can we be confident—and is David rightly not confident about this—because we have Jesus's promise that Holy Spirit will always remain in us. 

#todo/opzoeken De Heilige Geest als een borg #todo/opzoeken/engels . Die kan toch niet meer worden teruggenomen? Wat zegt David Pawson hiervan? #church/sermons/@davidpawson #biblestudy/theology/calvinism/osas

God's purpose is to love us so much that we will love Him back in return and that we will not sin against Him anymore for this reason, not for fear of His punishment or His anger or abandonment. We see this as a theme in the New Testament, although God's righteousness and justice are still clearly present in explaining the consequences for those who sin (cf. Romans and Revelation). But in the New Testament there is no fear shown for a God Who would leave us if we sinned too much against Him, nor does Paul warn us against these things. It is more that Paul warns Christians not to sin and—in my own words—that if they do sin and keep on sinning, they are not saved—not that they will lose salvation, but that they had never obtained it. #biblestudy/questions

*10 For my father and my mother have forsaken me,*
*but the LORD will take me in.*

Even if everyone has forsaken you, the Lord YHWH will never forsake us. He will never die and He will take us in if no one wants to. Even though he pled God not to forsake him in the previous verse, he knew that God would not. 
Why would David plead then? Because one should never take it for granted when God does something. Should we not ask for forgiveness when we already know that God will grant it to us when we show repentance? Should we not ask to be with Him forever in heaven, when we already have certainty of our position? 
Christians rarely do so, but it would not be incorrect. Perhaps we are more certain because of Jesus' promise given to us directly and His confirmation through the works of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles. Or perhaps we actually have a different position than David has and that God *could* forsake David, like he forsook Saul. #biblestudy/questions #todo/opzoeken difference between Old and New Testament in that the Holy Spirit will never leave us (anymore).

We know nothing about David's parents at the time of writing, but it is possible that his parents had already passed away at this time. So in a sense, they had already forsaken him and could not help him out. In another sense, his closest relatives turned against him, such as his wife and two oldest sons. Michal, for example, was against the way he showed his joy for the Lord (see 2 Samuel 6:16ff) when David danced among the servant women in a linen ephod. This is not a matter of misunderstanding and that Michal was embarrassed by her husband, a king, dancing on the streets, in a priestly garment, rather than his kingly attire, among other women, who were servants—and perhaps even the servants' servants—but she despised him, in her *heart*, for "uncovering himself" by wearing a simple priestly garment, which did not contain any gold or colored or otherwise expensive material, but merely consisted of white linen. The priestly garment hardly uncovered oneself except of any worldly *valuable* material, but Michal perhaps thought that the priesthood even was a position too lowly for a king. She definitely did not know or forgot about the fact that God is no respector of people and that there is no partiality (cf. Colossians 3:25). 

*11 Teach me your way, O LORD,*
*and lead me on a level path*
*because of my enemies.*
*12 Give me not up to the will of my adversaries;*
*for false witnesses have risen against me,*
*and they breathe out violence.*

This final advise to ask God to **teach** us His **way** is not contradictory to seeking His face. God's *way* entails the full package of what to do in any situation. One of these things is that when we are afraid we should inquire of His face. Ultimately, we must learn not only to do so in the face of danger, but ever and always seek His face, like David does. 

*13 I believe that I shall look upon the goodness of the LORD*
*in the land of the living!*

David knew that God is the god of the living and that his faithful ancestors are still alive and with Him. He even knows there is a land where there will be no longer be death, which he calls **the land of the living**. It is unclear whether he knows this land is in fact the New Earth and how it comes about, but he has probably gained this knowledge through prophetic insight. Referring back to verse 4, it is still unclear whether he knows that there is no temple in heaven nor on the New Earth. 
Paul used an argument against the Sadducees #todo/opzoeken reference to prove that the Resurrection and the resurrection of all who believe, but saying that (1) God is the god of the living, because it is used in #todo/opzoeken reference, and that (2) God is the god of Abraham, who physically has died and the status of whose soul is unknown to us. But following from (1) we can deduct that Abraham is still alive and thus we know that the soul will not die. This does not prove the resurrection of the body, but adding a reference to this psalm we can say that (3) there is a land of the living, which leads us to conclude there is *body* for this *land*, unless David is being very poetic and spiritual here and considers heaven as land as well. #todo/nogaftemaken 

*14 Wait for the LORD;*

*wait for the LORD!*

## Structure
The Lord is gracious and answered David's plea with the simple answer: **"Seek my face."** This refers to v.4 but I do not know exactly in which context. The transition to v.4 is a bit sudden. David writes about confidence in battle in v.3, which is very "hard"—as in hard rock—and comes across as a battle song. Just as an example, something like "We will rock you" by *Queen* or "Our God is an awesome God" by Michael W. Smith #todo/opzoeken  author?. Yet in v.4 he then speaks about His trust in God, which would certainly change the figurative "tone" of the music. 
Then, again, in v.7 he mentions to seek God's face, but now not from an emotional highground (meaning that one is happy and content), but from the depths, when David pleads and cries, even until the brink of fear of being cast off by God (v.9). 
To me it seems more logical that this part of emotional depths in vv.7-10 should come first where David learns about the solution to his fears, which is to seek God's face. Then come vv.1-3 where David shows "his" prowess and fearlessness in battle, even among an encampment of enemy armies. But in vv.4-6 he explains, as an old man looking back, how he managed this. 
vv.7-10 would then be sort of a flashback, from where he returns  in vv.11-12 and provides his ultimate life lesson.
He ends in v.13 with his literal *credo* and concludes, as an advice for others, in v.14 to wait for the Lord.
