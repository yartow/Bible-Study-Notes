# Psalms 40 (ESV) 
***My Help and My Deliverer***
*TO THE CHOIRMASTER. A PSALM OF DAVID.*
*1 I waited patiently for the LORD;*
*he inclined to me and heard my cry.*

*2 He drew me up from the pit of destruction,*
*out of the miry bog,*
*and set my feet upon a rock,*
*making my steps secure.*

*3 He put a new song in my mouth,*
*a song of praise to our God.*
*Many will see and fear,*
*and put their trust in the LORD.*

*4 Blessed is the man who makes*
*the LORD his trust,*
*who does not turn to the proud,*
*to those who go astray after a lie!*

*5 You have multiplied, O LORD my God,*
*your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us;*
*none can compare with you!*
*I will proclaim and tell of them,*
*yet they are more than can be told.*
*6 In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted,*
*but you have given me an open ear.*
*Burnt offering and sin offering*
*you have not required.*

*7 Then I said, “Behold, I have come;*
*in the scroll of the book it is written of me:*
*8 ::I delight to do your will, O my God;*::
::*your law is within my heart.::”*

*9 I have told the glad news of deliverance*
*in the ::great congregation::;*
*behold, I have not restrained my lips,*
*as you know, O LORD.*
*10 I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart;*
*I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation;*
*I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness*
*from the great congregation.*

This part seems to be encapsulated by the terms "in the great congregation" and "from the great congregation". 

*11 As for you, O LORD, you will not restrain*
*your mercy from me;*
*your steadfast love and your faithfulness will*
*ever preserve me!*
*12 For evils have encompassed me*
*beyond number;*
*my iniquities have overtaken me,*
*and I cannot see;*
*they are more than the hairs of my head;*
*my heart fails me.*

*13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me!*
*O LORD, make haste to help me!*
*14 Let those be put to shame and disappointed altogether*
*who seek to snatch away my life;*
*let those be turned back and brought to dishonor*
*who delight in my hurt!*
*15 Let those be appalled because of their shame*
*who say to me, “Aha, Aha!”*
*16 But may all who seek you*
*rejoice and be glad in you;*
*may those who love your salvation*
*say continually, “Great is the LORD!”*
*17 As for me, I am poor and needy,*
*but the Lord takes thought for me.*
*You are my help and my deliverer;*
*do not delay, O my God!*

## Structure
Where contemporary (English or western) songs almost alway follow the standard structure of verses and choruses, with an intermezzo, instrumental interlude or outro now and then, David's songs, or perhaps Hebrew songs seem to differ very much from each other. 
Songs based on the Psalms and hymns were written based on a single tune, a melody that is, for one verse, which would then be repeated for every verse. An example of this would be *Amazing Grace*, where the musical climax is within a verse. 
Both styles, however, do not fit the Psalms as we see here in Psalm 40. We see that not only the structure is different, but also the climactic changes. One could formalize the structure using contemporary words as below, where the `plea` is new term not used in contemporary music such as in vv.9-10, i.e. `A-B-A'-A'-A-A'-B`, explained in more details in Psalm 70.

## Devotion

We ask God to deliver us, we ask Him to be pleased with that, and to make haste, but we ourselves fail to tell of His great righteousness *in the great congregation*—in multiple ways. 
1. We fail to speak of it.
2. If we speak of it, then the righteousness we speak about is not as great as God really is.
3. If we speak of it, we do not act out and *show* His righteousness. 

**Ad 1.** Many (including myself) fail to speak of God's righteousness, for speaking about *His* righteousness entails that we should speak about *our* unrighteousness. So we speak about His love and His mercy or about how good He is.  Of course these topics inevitably lead us to speaking about our own lack of love and mercy for others as well, for otherwise it would be a sermon or a testimony without self-reflection, but they do not have the same impact as when we speak about righteousness. 
Now keeping in mind that God's *qualities* or *attributes*(Footnote: Louis Berkhof #tags/famouspeople/christian prefers the use of the word "qualities" over "attributes" for the latter seems to indicate some kind of addition on the Person of God, as described in his #tags/books *Systematic Theology*.) are all connected to and cannot be separated from each other, the topic of righteousness might have the most impact on our lives. Showing love to our neighbors should be done every second of our lives, but is usually expressed when we interact with people. At certain moments in time we would want to retreat ourselves from others so that we can have some time for ourselves, not for the purpose of rest necessarily, but for some self-love, such as a personal hobby. Now, setting aside the question whether that is good or bad, we can say perhaps that one is not hurting anyone or not abiding to the commandment to love one another if we view this commandment in a less strict view for the sake of argument. However, when it concerns the topic of righteousness there is hardly a thing we can do without inflicting unrighteousness in the world. 
Take for example a person who simply wants to have dinner. Can he go out for a meal when he knows that the meat on the menu is from animals who have not been treated fairly and *justly* with the righteousness due to them? And can one eat the vegetables when he knows that they have been sprayed with pesticides that not only hurt his own body but also pollute the air and the ground and all other animals who eat from it?
One would need to go fully organic or even better, biodynamic(Footnote: Note that biodynamic agriculture is based on occult practices, but in my opinion this is no problem for Christians as long as they do not engage in the rituals themselves, but see notes on 1 Corinthians 8.) agriculture then, which would be a sacrifice in the amount of food one can buy for himself or the number of times he can go out eating, although the quality of food and of his health would improve. 
This would not be enough, however, it would also impact the products he buys and the television he watches. Products from certain brands (if not most to all) incorporate unrighteousness in the factories where the material is produced. Take for example Nike's footballs, which are (or were, partially) hand-made by Indian children, or Primark's clothes. As for television programs, these also often make use of the greediness of parents (for money) and children (for fame) who then miss out on a regular childhood and work long days in order to get the attention they so desire. If we look at the results of people like Macauley Culkin and River Phoenix, and other child stars like Judy Garland and Corey Haim #tags/famouspeople/actors, how unsuccessful they have *morally* become leading up to the usage of drug overdose and accidental suicide in the case of many, can we then watch a movie without sensing the unrighteousness inflicted to the people involved? 
Unrighteousness takes place in all of the things we do, watch or buy—even in the paper of the books we read. It is impossible to account for all the things we do, but we can change this, *if* we speak more on this topic—but we do not, perhaps exactly because of this reason, namely that we do not want to give others and ourself this unpleasant feeling in *everything* we do.

**Ad 2.** Our second failure to speak of His righteousness is when we speak of God's actions and feelings as if that is all there is. God, however, is shown as incomprehensible, un-understandable #todo/opzoeken/engels#(Isaiah 55:8 "For my thoughts are not your thoughts"), He *seems* contradictory when He says in Ezekiel 18:23
> Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord GOD, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?  
but at the same time he does #todo/opzoeken when the Bible says that God *hates* the wicked.
 
**Ad 3.** The third failures arises in our actions. In everything we do, we do not show the righteousness of God. Our righteousness is always based on our self-righteousness. We want righteousness for ourselves, and that may benefit others, but when we are not the side that is going to granted righteousness, we say nothing. For example, if I were a criminal who cheats people of their money, and I see another criminal doing the same, but going much too far, so far as even cheating old people out of their pension, I can expose him, but I would have the risk of being exposed myself. In that case I would hesitate, for I want righteousness, and that justice prevails, over others, but not me. 
Another example of self-righteousness is seen in the movies #tags/movies *Ocean's Eleven* and *Ocean's Thirteen* where a group led by Daniel Ocean and his partner Rusty, played by George Clooney and Brad Pitt #tags/famouspeople/actors, respectively, perform heists to rob casinos of their money under the guise of righteousness, for example to take revenge on casino owners who are even bigger criminals and more unrighteous than they are.
