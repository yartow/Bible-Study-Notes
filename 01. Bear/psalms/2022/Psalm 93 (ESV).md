# Psalm 93 (ESV) 
***The LORD Reigns***
*1 The LORD reigns; he is robed in majesty;*
*the LORD is robed; he has put on strength as his belt.*
*Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved.*
*2 Your throne is established from of old;*
*you are from everlasting.*
*3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD,*
*the floods have lifted up their voice;*
*the floods lift up their roaring.*
*4 Mightier than the thunders of many waters,*
*mightier than the waves of the sea,*
*the LORD on high is mighty!*

All kinds of examples can be mentioned here concerning the power of nature. Floods, storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis and earthquakes. But mightier than all those is God. The more one boasts of the power of nature, the bigger one unbeknownst lifts up God, for God is the Creator of all these. 
Speaking of which, nuclear bombs are created by man and the biggest nuclear bomb in the world could make quite a big hole in the Earth, a few hundred meters wide and deep perhaps. But no bomb has the power of a volcanic eruption which can blow up a whole mountain, with devastating effects that spread to the other side of the Earth. And God is bigger still. 

**Prayer**
O Lord, how I praise Your almight and Your power. Your words created all this and everything will be destroyed by Your Word, yet Your Word will always remain and remain true and faithful. 
No power on Earth can ever defeat You. Science in its current form has entered the world in the last few centuries, and man has been able to do greater things than his predecessors have ever been able to achieve. But even man, with all of his gained knowledge (which is from You), has reached its limits. It has reached its limits in computing power, in astro engineering—for it cannot even pass through the outer atmosphere—in nuclear fission and energy conservation. Will batteries ever get better than they are now, perhaps a ten-fold with graphene, but nothing will ever get to the efficiency with which You have created the fuel for this Earth (even though I do not know if You intended the #todo/opzoeken/engels aardolie to be used like we do). 

**Only holiness befits your house, O LORD**, nothing else would fit in Your house. Everything would be thrown out because it is not worthy of being in Your house, let alone in Your presence. But You have prepared a room for us, human beings which are evil from the inside out—for Your Son has made us holy through His blood. 

We praise You and we thank You, O God Almighty. God of the universe and everything that is in it. 
Be our Help and guidance, in this life and forever always. 

Amen.

*5 Your decrees are very trustworthy;*
*holiness befits your house,*
*O LORD, forevermore.*
