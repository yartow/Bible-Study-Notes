# Psalm 107
*Psalm 107:1-3*
*1 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;*
*his love endures forever.*
*2 Let the redeemed of the Lord tell their story—*
*those he redeemed from the hand of the foe,*
*3 those he gathered from the lands,*
*from east and west, from north and south.*

The testimonies of men who have been saved by You are proof that You are strong and that You do good. They tell that You care about people and that You love us.
You are present everywhere in the world and our family in Christ is bigger than we will ever know. Earth may seem small compared to other planets, but it is Your grace that we are on this planet, because on a bigger one we could not have completed the Great Commission. Not that we can complete it here without Your help, though.
Let us hear more of your testimonies, Lord, and let us be one as well.

*Psalm 107:4-9 NIV*

*Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no way to a city where they could settle. They were hungry and thirsty, and their lives ebbed away.*

How much does this seem to reflect our lives. We were living on wastelands where nothing could fulfill us. Any water would make us thirsty again. We were so dry that anything was taken into our bodies.
But now we know You, O Lord, and when we see other water sources we know that these will not fulfill our thirst, for we want only to drink from Your source, now that we have drunk from it.

*Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress. He led them by a straight way to a city where they could settle.*

It was easy as that. We cried out and You helped us, You helped us by showing us a city and giving us hope.
Our city is in heaven, near You that us where we belong and where we want to be. Right now You are already showing us the Kingdom of Heaven.

*Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind, for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.*

The Lord gives everything we people need, those who are hungry are fed, and those thirsty are given water to drink. The Lord needs to be thanked for that, we too often forget to do that. Also, we forget the reason why God is so good to us, it is because He loves us.

*Psalm 107:10-16 NIV*

*Some sat in darkness, in utter darkness, prisoners suffering in iron chains, because they rebelled against God’s commands and despised the plans of the Most High. So he subjected them to bitter labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.*

Some of us have rebelled more against God or against His commands. In fact, when You are rebelling against His commands, You are rebelling against Him as well. Even if you do not know Him, You will still have sinned.
But what is even worse here is that these prisoners despised the plans the Lord, the Most High. It is not that they merely did not know the Lord's commands, but they knowingly disobeyed it and set up others to do so.
Take the example of abortions. It is not about people who commit abortions, but people who set others up in allowing it, by changing the law to allow it, by supporting it with money.

*Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress. He brought them out of darkness, the utter darkness, and broke away their chains.*

Still the Lord helps out these people, Who have done so much damage to His Name. Even when they are saved, their legacy will still cause major impacts on this world. The world as we know it, with secular laws on abortion and gay marriage, was created by these people. A cry to the Lord, and they are saved.
The same goes for us, we cry out and we are saved, but the damage we have created stays on this world.

*Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind, for he breaks down gates of bronze and cuts through bars of iron.*

This verse is repeated in verse 21 below. I think it means that whatever trouble we are in, it is always God Who saves us and whom we should thank.
Also, it is always Him performing a miracle like cutting through iron.

*Psalm 107:17-22 NIV*

*Some became fools through their rebellious ways and suffered affliction because of their iniquities. They loathed all food and drew near the gates of death.*

Why would anyone loathe food, the very food that keeps you alive? Only if you loathe the person who brings it to you, I guess. Or if he wants something else more than the thing keeping him alive.
We are talking about addictions here. When you are addicted, you do not care about food, and depending on the grade not even about money, your family and even your life.
Whatever it is you are loathing, you are drawing near death, because you are keeping that away that gives you life.

*Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress. He sent out his word and healed them; he rescued them from the grave.*

But God can heal, even when you are already in the grave. Better yet, He saved us all from the grave. Some from an addiction

*Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind. Let them sacrifice thank offerings and tell of his works with songs of joy*

Songs are also written to tell of God's work.

*Psalm 107:23-32 NIV*

*Some went out on the sea in ships; they were merchants on the mighty waters. They saw the works of the Lord , his wonderful deeds in the deep. For he spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves.*

No matter what employment one has, one will always see God in his work if he watches closely. God is working inside of people and through circumstances.
God changes whole situations with just one word, sometimes from one day to the other. Let alone what happens when He speaks a few sentences.

*They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths; in their peril their courage melted away. They reeled and staggered like drunkards; they were at their wits’ end. Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress.*

No matter how experienced sailors, or whatever business, there is no safe place, there is no place where we can hide from God, from His wrath if He wants to punish us. But there is also no place where He cannot hear You or where we cannot feel His love.

*He stilled the storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed. They were glad when it grew calm, and he guided them to their desired haven.*

Peace and quietness is what makes us glad, and we realize that only when we are in it. Too often we want to work, because that gives us purpose, or do something for others, so we can help God out. But resting next to God is what He really wants from us. Enjoying His presence, His gifts and His grace.

*Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind. Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders.*

Once again, I need to thank Him more often and thank Him in front of the assembly, that is the members of my congregation, and in front the the elders, that is the Commission of my congregation.

*Psalm 107:33-38 NIV*

*He turned rivers into a desert, flowing springs into thirsty ground, and fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who lived there.*

Do not be conceited to think that the Lord will not destroy what He has made, that He will not make ugly what was created beautifully. God will do what it takes to bring righteousness.

*He turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs; there he brought the hungry to live, and they founded a city where they could settle. They sowed fields and planted vineyards that yielded a fruitful harvest; he blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased, and he did not let their herds diminish.*

On the other hand, God is capable of bringing back to life that which He let die, such as the desert and the fields, and He can make that fruitful again for generations long. God has proven so, and has already done that for the people of Israel.
Let us not test out God to see if He will bring punishment on us, but let us obey Him so He will bless us with fruitfulness for the righteous.

*39 Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled*
*by oppression, calamity and sorrow;*
*40 he who pours contempt on nobles*
*made them wander in a trackless waste.*
*41 But he lifted the needy out of their affliction*
*and increased their families like flocks.*
*42 The upright see and rejoice,*
*but all the wicked shut their mouths.*

God knows what it takes to make a person regret things, to humble him and to let him realize he is nothing without God.
You, Lord, are the Lord of lords, would there be anyone better or wiser than You? Of course not. So the way You have done it, is perfect. You picked out the right people to pour contempt on, and You gave them what they deserved.
On the other hand, You help out the needy as well, but I dare not say they got what they deserved. For all of us have sinned, the needy and righteous as well, but because of Your love and grace, we do not get what we deserve, we get less punishment and more rewards than we deserve. 

*43 Let the one who is wise heed these things*
*and ponder the loving deeds of the Lord.*

Let me think about all of the good things You have done for me and realize that I could have been in the first category if You wished so. It was by Your choice, that You saved me and have blessed me with everything I have.
Thank You for that, Lord Jesus.
