# Psalm 119 Part 4
*http://bible.com/111/psa.119.157-164.niv*
*Many are the foes who persecute me, but I have not turned from your statutes.*

In all my years, I have trespassed Your laws many times, but I have never turned from it (as far as I know). Oh yes, I have been living in sin for many years, and according to Your definition I have turned from Your statutes, but never have I not acknowledged Your holiness and Your Law as definitive.
Unfortunately I lacked people around me, reprimanding me for what I had done. I needed Your statutes and I still need them because this world is not helping me.

*I look on the faithless with loathing, for they do not obey your word.*

The ones who do not have faith a pitiful. They have either never heard of You, and I really pity them, or they are so stubborn or dumb that they cannot even see, or are not willing to acknowledge You or anything supernatural exist(s).

*See* *how I love your precepts; preserve my life, Lord , in accordance with your love.*

I hope I have shown enough in my life that I love Your precepts. Of course I have been like a Pharisee as well, caring more about the Law than the person, but thank You for making me realize that, through my wife.

*All your words are true; all your righteous laws are eternal.*

All of Your words are true, Lord, none of them are wrong. I do not know how different versions of the Bible such as the Masoretic text and the Dead Sea scrolls with contradictions between them (such as the height of Goliath) must be interpreted, but as for Your promises, all of them are true.

*R* **ulers** *persecute me without cause, but my heart trembles at your word.*

I am not afraid of the rulers persecuting me. Whether it is an Islamic government or a terrorist group link Boko Haram, I have put my hope in You.
But if *You* are angry with me, I am terrified. If You say one word of reprimanding through the Bible, I will immediately obey. 

*I* *rejoice in your promise like one who finds great spoil.*

Your promise indeed is like great spoil. David, or the psalmist, knew You for sure, for this is what I am feeling as well.
I have received much more from You than I deserve, both materially and spiritually. Why do I get the honor to be good at studying, and in languages and music, my physical and mental traits? Everything good has been given by You.
I have let myself be corrupted, however, by letting arrogance and boasting get over me. Release me from this arrogance, Lord, for I want my character to be like Yours. And if You need to cut away a part of the good flesh with it, then so be it. I will give up every part of my body, if that let's my soul go to heaven.

*I hate and detest falsehood but I love your law. Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous laws.*

Seven is a round number according to You, a holy number signifying wholeness. David probably means he praises You the whole day long for Your righteous laws.
I praise You for Your laws, for the fact You have laws, unlike Hinduism, that You have righteous laws, unlike the islam, and for *Your* laws, because they are Yours and Yours alone. You have made them personal, for our good, because You are holy.

*Great peace have those who love your law, and nothing can make them stumble.*

I thank You, Lord, for the power I have seen in Ling Kwang, his strength to cope with the difficult situation and all of the stress added unto it, at his work, even by Christians! Lord, I pray that You keep giving Ling Kwang, Xiao Tian and Fang Hong strength and that they will pray for Jennifer. Please help her to grow spiritually, as Your child, Lord.

*I wait for your salvation, Lord , and I follow your commands.*

I know You will save all Your children from the suffering, self-doubt and codependency and all other hurts, hang-ups and habits we haven.
We will follow Your commands, thank You for showing me I am not alone in this.

*I obey your statutes, for I love them greatly. I obey your precepts and your statutes, for all my ways are known to you.*

There is nothing I would like more than obeying Your statutes all my life long, but I know that is not possible. I am an unclean man with unclean lips, and sin will always exist in this body of mine.
But with your Spirit I can still worship You without being hindered by my sin.

*May my cry come before you, Lord ; give me understanding according to your word.*

Lord, I cry out to You, but sometimes I do not feel like You are hearing me. Of course now I know better, I know You hear everything and know everything even before I have even thought about it. You even feel everything, for You were man as well.
Give me understanding, to comprehend the situation I am in, how difficult it may be to know that You are leading and are not leaving me, but also to understand why I am in it.
I do not wish to know everything, for I know that some things are hidden from us for a reason, but I ask enough understanding according to Your Word. Whatever You have made known through Your Word, please make known to me and my heart as well.

*May my supplication come before you; deliver me according to your promise.*

My supplications are my pleads to save me from sin, and to be in Your presence all the time. To become like You and to love my fellowmen, especially my wife and son, like You have loved me and Your Church.
I know You may not deliver me as I wish, to be in heaven right now, or deliver me in the way I wish, to have an easy life with easy people around me, but I ask You to deliver me according to Your promise.

*May my lips overflow with praise, for you teach me your decrees.*

For everything I have I thank You alone. All of what I am, everything that is good about me, I only thank You.
Everything that is good about me, even though that is not much, it is by Your decrees that I have learned it.

*May my tongue sing of your word, for all your commands are righteous.*

My singing is for You, my praise is for You. Every word in each song written for You gives You praise. They praise You because You are worth it, but also because the writers do not see unrighteousness in You. They see You as a loving and honest God

*May your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts.*

I have chosen Your precepts indeed, I intend to follow them, but it also means I must tell others about it and rebuke them when they are wrong.
Help me with Your wisdom, o Lord.

*I long for your salvation, Lord , and your law gives me delight.*

I still need Your salvation, even though I have been saved, I am daily under duress. Right now, not specifically with sin, but with the pressure to finish my project for the summer conference.
Help me not to sin because of this pressure, save me and give me relief, Lord. Help me not to be impatient or stressed, and not to not confide in You in this way.

*Let me live that I may praise you, and may your laws sustain me.*

I want to love to praise You, I sent to work to praise You, and I want to give You praise with my work for the summer conference.
Bless these four days, bless the children and the teachers that they may worship You in the right way and that the children may come before You and get to know You.

*I have strayed like a lost sheep. Seek your servant, for I have not forgotten your commands.*

I have strayed, but You have brought me back. I had forgotten how much fun it was at the summer conference, but You reminded me of it.
You reminded me of how necessary this conference is for our local church.
