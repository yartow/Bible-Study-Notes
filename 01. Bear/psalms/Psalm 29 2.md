# Psalm 29
*Ascribe to the Lord, you heavenly beings,*
*ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.*
*Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;*
*worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness. (Psalm 29:1, 2 NIV)*

Ascribe everything to Him. All glory, everything you thought you did yourself, give honor to God for that.
Give glory to His Name, for that is what He is. Pure glory.

*The voice of the Lord is over the waters;*
*the God of glory thunders, the Lord thunders over the mighty waters.*

*The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is majestic.*
*The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars; the Lord breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. He makes Lebanon leap like a calf, Sirion like a young wild ox.*

Understand what the powers of God's voice. Often all we need to hear, is His voice and we're all set. Hearing just His voice is enough for some to be send out to China, Africa or South America and suffering a whole life time.

*The voice of the Lord strikes with flashes of lightning. The voice of the Lord shakes the desert; the Lord shakes the Desert of Kadesh.*
*The voice of the Lord twists the oaks and strips the forests bare. And in his temple all cry, “Glory!” (Psalm 29:3-9NIV)*

No matter how thick an oak is, God can twist it.
There is not a mountain too high for God or an ocean too deep. This may sound cheesy but can you imagine any problem of you that is too difficult to solve? Can God not solve all of your money problems? Can He repair relationships? Can He bring the dead back to life? Yes, He can do all of those things and even more! Better yet, He has, always, a better solution than we can think of.
