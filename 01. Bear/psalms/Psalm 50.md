# Psalm 50
Tot *Psalm 50:1-3 NIV*

*The Mighty One, God, the Lord , speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to where it sets.*

Another piece of evidence that shows that God knows everything.

*From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.*

Everything started in Israel. Even though the Jews are not the protagonists anymore, I still think this is true.
A small country as Israel is, can still influence the whole world, and the whole world is against them.
If Jews were to come back to their Father, would that not be an amazing testimony? Imagine all the consequences, if Jews were to share their knowledge, but especially the love they reveived from their Father.

*Our God comes and will not be silent; a fire devours before him, and around him a tempest rages.*

Forgive me, Father, for all the sins I have committed. I know You cannot be silent. Your fire will and must rage, for justice needs to be prevail.

*Psalm 50:4-6 NIV*

*He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that he may judge his people:*
*“Gather to me this consecrated people, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”*
*And the heavens proclaim his righteousness, for he is a God of justice.*

God summons heaven and earth as His witness, although He does not need them, and although heaven and earth are create by them, and men as well.
It is ridiculous that God Himself needs to prove his existence and his righteousness to His own creation.
But He still does, out of love for us.
How are heaven and earth witnesses? I see it as logic. His consecrated people, in this case the Jews, may be punished, but seeing what they have done, it is only more than logic. An earthly father would have done the same, no less a heavenly father.

*Psalm 50:7-9 NIV*

*“Listen, my people, and I will speak; I will testify against you, Israel: I am God, your God.*

This is Who God is: *our* God. He is the God Who created people. The heavens and earth and all that is in it He created as well, but He does not name Himself that way. Most often He let's us know He is a personal God. 

*I bring no charges against you concerning your sacrifices or concerning your burnt offerings, which are ever before me. I have no need of a bull from your stall or of goats from your pens,*

God here Himself testifies against us. But it is not because of our offering. No animal is too little or too big for Him. What I expect God to say is that all that matters is the heart with which one sacrifices.
This goes for our money offering as well. Give he first portion of your money and the best portion, no matter how little it is.
Forgive me, Father, if I take too much measures to sustain in my material provision.

*Psalm 50:10-13 NIV*

*for every animal of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills. I know every bird in the mountains, and the insects in the fields are mine.*

We all know God does not require our love, our sacrifice or anything else from us. It is, however, the other way around. We cannot live and sustain without Him. Even the Gentiles who do not know him and even doubt or deny His mere existence, need God for their survival.
Who gives them rain, and blesses them with talents? Who is merciful enough to give them talents and opportunities to use them? God alone.

Thus it is that God wants us to exist and especially *live*, He does not want us to just breathe and eat, but enjoy our life to the fullest. Therefore we need to sacrifice to Him, because in our sacrifice we accept God's mercy, His love and His righteousness. All these which are needed for a full life. 

*If I were hungry I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it. Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?*

So we get to the conclusion that God does not *need* food or sacrifices, but He does ask for it for the reason to give us life as we are supposed to live it. 

*Psalm 50:14-15 NIV*

*“Sacrifice thank offerings to God, fulfill your vows to the Most High, and call on me in the day of trouble;*
*I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”*

Another reason is that we must learn to fulfill our vows, no matter what happens in life, in what situation and no matter about what the vow was. In this case, it is about money, the hardest thing for us to let go.

Furthermore, what sign is better than that of a sacrifice offered being accepted by God by means of an answer of a prayer?
If someone helps you, for free, do you feel guilty? Even when he says you do not have to?
Would it not be great if you could just give something back, if only as a gesture?

*Psalm 50:16-17 NIV*

*But to the wicked person, God says: “What right have you to recite my laws or take my covenant on your lips? You hate my instruction and cast my words behind you.*

The laws in the Bible are made for everyone, but it is also full of promises. Wicked people only stand on the promises but not on the terms of it.
They do not care about the Bible nor its wise instructions, even if it helps them, even if the Bible proves to be right every time again.

*Psalm 50:18-21 NIV*

*When you see a thief, you join with him; you throw in your lot with adulterers.*
*You use your mouth for evil and harness your tongue to deceit. You sit and testify against your brother and slander your own mother’s son.*

Wicked people do as others do, and think and feel as others do as well. That is the main problem, they lose their sense of morals.
They use their gifts for wrong purposes, they even do what no one would do, sell out their own family and siblings.

*When you did these things and I kept silent, you thought I was exactly like you.*
*But I now arraign you and set my accusations before you.*

Quite often when God does not say anything, people think He agrees or does not think that what they are doing is wrong.
But He will speak, so we have no excuse to say that God did not warn us.

If God has enough of us, we are really done. Then no one can help us anymore, we are totally in the hands of the Satan.

*Psalm 50:22-23 NIV*

*“Consider this, you who forget God, or I will tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you: Those who sacrifice thank offerings honor me, and to the blameless I will show my salvation.”*

Fortunately, God always gives us warnings, and many of them, because He does not want us to be doomed.
And what He asks is so small. He does not ask for big offerings, only thank offerings.
