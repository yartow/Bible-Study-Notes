# Psalm 1
1. The man who does not do as others do when they do bad, and most certainly does not do these bad things or worse, let other people do bad things, is a man God likes.
2. This man likes to do what God likes and he remembers and keeps himself reminded of everything that God has said.
3. In every circumstance he will be supplied with enough wisdom and moreover, his wisdom will cause many good things for himself and all around him.
4. The exact opposite of this man is the wicked man. He has no foot to stand on, a small wind will blow him away.
5. They will not even be visible at the awards, at the end of time, because they do not belong there.
6. The Lord looks out over righteous people, who do their best not to sin, but those who purposely sin and keep sinning God will stop blessing.
