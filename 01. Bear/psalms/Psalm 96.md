# Psalm 96
*Psalm 96:1-3 NIV*

*Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord , all the earth. Sing to the Lord , praise his name; proclaim his salvation day after day.*

I need to sing new songs to the Lord. He has done so many things, it should be easy to write a new song for Him.
I need to sings *to* ** ** the Lord, for Him only is my music written, His Name must be praised. 
I must not forget about my salvation, He saves me every day. He has saved me from my past and in the present He saves me from my enemies. He is worthy of being thanked for every day. His salvation must be proclaimed every day for this reason.

*Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples.*

Every nation that is as thriving as it is, is only so because of God. Every land that has minerals, metals or oil, only has this because God has given it to them. Every land that has intellectual property and inventions, or strategic positions for war, only has this because God has given it to them.
God works in every country and in every country there are people praising God for His miracles.

*Psalm 96:4-6 NIV*

*For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.*

No god is greater than God, if any other gods exist, which they do not. But even the gods claimed to be existent by peoples in this world, cannot match the awesomeness of God.
Idols are supposedly gods of the sea, of the wind and of Earth, but our God has created both heaven and earth, and all the stars and the whole universe. Which God claims to have done that?
I know Shiva did something like that, but he was not complete, hence there are other gods necessary to fulfill other purposes.
God does not need other gods. He alone can do everything, He can create everything and rule over everything.

*Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and glory are in his sanctuary.*

Both on the outside and the inside God is glorious. He defines what is splendor and majesty. As written before, He is the ultimate King, of which every king on Earth is only an image. He is splendor Himself, of which diamonds are only a pale shade. There is no material on Earth that can show us His splendor.
On the inside He is strength, He is so powerful that He does not even need to show or use it. Just like a father play wrestling with His child, He does not need exert any strength.
God says or thinks what He wants and it just is.

*Psalm 96:7-10 NIV*

*Ascribe to the Lord , all you families of nations, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength. Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name; bring an offering and come into his courts.*

Whatever miracle or act of glory, ascribe it to the Lord, for only He deserves the credits.
Bring an offering and come into His courts. Do something for the Lord, give Him what you can but do it near Him. God wants you to be near Him and personalize your gift to Him.

*Worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness; tremble before him, all the earth.*

Worship the Lord, yes, but not for the wrong reasons, or at least, do it for the right reasons. Do it because He is holy.

*Say among the nations, “The Lord reigns.” The world is firmly established, it cannot be moved; he will judge the peoples with equity.*

This is a command, to tell the nations that God exists. Do not just show it, tell it with words. The reverse is also true, do not just tell it, show it as well.
Tell the nations that the world is firmly established, that means no one can change it. No one can change the owner of this world, the goal of this world, no one can change the rules of this world. The physical and moral laws are embedded in this world. And God will judge the peoples with these laws.

*Psalm 96:11-13 NIV*

*Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad; let the sea resound, and all that is in it.*

Thank the Lord that He is always with us, wherever we are. We can always depend on Him.

*Let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them; let all the trees of the forest sing for joy.*

The miracles He has done for nature are immense, and only what we think we do or do not understand is perceived as a miracle. There is so much more we do not know.
There are miracles in fields, there are hundreds of kinds of animals in the fields, thousands of insects and a million kinds of microbes perhaps. Each of them with cells we do not fully comprehend and are never able to build.

*Let all creation rejoice before the Lord , for he comes, he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in his faithfulness.*

Be glad as well because the Lord will come and He will judge everyone. We expect a good judgement for we have the hope given to us by Jesus Christ. Not because we were faithful, which we we were not completely, but God will give us righteousness, more than we deserve.
