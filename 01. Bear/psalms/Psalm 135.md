# Psalm 135
*Praise the Lord . Praise the name of the Lord ; praise him, you servants of the Lord , you who minister in the house of the Lord , in the courts of the house of our God.*
*Psalm 135:1-2 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.135.1-2.NIV*

Praise the Lord as the first thing you do. Not for a reason you have to know. Just like this Psalm, there is no *because*. If you are a servant of the Lord, praise Him, for He is worthy. 

*Praise the Lord , for the Lord is good; sing praise to his name, for that is pleasant. For the Lord has chosen Jacob to be his own, Israel to be his treasured possession.*
*Psalm 135:3-4 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.135.3-4.NIV*

Now comes the *because*, it is because God is good. Why do we sing praises, because it is pleasant for Him. 
The Lord has chosen the people of Israel as His possession, and therefore longs praises from them. Of course this goes for us as well now that we have been chosen.

**I know that the Lord is great, that our Lord is greater than all gods. The Lord does whatever pleases him, in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and all their depths. He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth; he sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.**
*Psalm 135:5-7 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.135.5-7.NIV*

Every god of whatever religion attested to a certain element of nature or characteristic of human beings is infinitely smaller than God. God is above all of them, with no unrighteous feelings as the Greek gods have, such as jealousy and anger, selfishness and stubbornness.
Our God Almighty is creator of everything, he does not only control nature, He *created* it. 

*He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, the firstborn of people and animals. He sent his signs and wonders into your midst, Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants. He struck down many nations and killed mighty kings— Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kings of Canaan— and he gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to his people Israel.*
*Psalm 135:8-12 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.135.8-12.NIV*

You have shown us so many signs and wonders, the greatest of these being the land of Israel. It is a miracle how You have destroyed the Egyptians, their country and their army, and the result is visible in the question, *where do the Jews come from?*, but it has not left its trails in history. The Satan has removed all traces of it to let the world doubt about Your existence. 
In Israel as well You have shown us Your grace, and given us the land of Canaan by defeating their kings, but that too has been in doubt by this world, who think the Israelites should give back (part of) the country to the Palestinians.

But Your Word remains, Lord. The devil can try to get rid of all evidence, but He can never get rid of Your Word, because You have promised so.

*Your name, Lord , endures forever, your renown, Lord , through all generations. For the Lord will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants.*
*Psalm 135:13-14 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.135.13-14.NIV*

The devil can do all he wishes to remove Your footprint and proof of Your work here in Earth and in heaven, but Your Name endures forever. I do not understand why he is still trying, he can see that the largest religion in the world is Christianity, the number of times the Bible has been translated, there is no stopping to it.
Most of all, if he wants to destroy proof of Your hand in creation, He needs to destroy human beings, which is probably what he wants to, but cannot do because You are withholding him, but also because then he would no have the chance to convince them not to believe in You.
So he destroys nature, the beauty of nature, created by You, is caused by the worldly beauty of cars, created by man. It makes man long for materialism, neglect stewardship, pollute nature with carbon dioxide, make people rich of oil and investing this in wrong companies, while oil is causing wars at the same time and leaving many hungry and poor. Never mind the accidents that happen with driving and driving too fast.
All the while people are thinking of status and wealth and what they want. Selfishness is the key term here.
Though there are advantages, it seems like cars are truly made by the devil.
Speaking of which, the next verse emphasizes what I meant.

*The idols of the nations are silver and gold, made by human hands. They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see. They have ears, but cannot hear, nor is there breath in their mouths. Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them.*
*Psalm 135:15-18 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.135.15-18.NIV*

Lord, I know I have a longing for fast cars, adrenalin, beautiful and expensive cars. I know I am not objective when I say I want a BMW 5 series for practical reasons, for safety and for space. Lord, please do not let the devil tempt me with images or even with real gifts. I want to serve You only and let nothing lead me from the path You have chosen for me.

*All you Israelites, praise the Lord ; house of Aaron, praise the Lord ; house of Levi, praise the Lord ; you who fear him, praise the Lord . Praise be to the Lord from Zion, to him who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise the Lord .*
*Psalm 135:19-21 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.135.19-21.NIV*

Let this be a command for me. Let me praise You, let me speak to You on behalf of my fellow believers and praise You. Let me praise You because I fear You.
Let me praise You because You are here with us, not only on Earth, but in every heart, and also because You dwell in Jerusalem, from where You rule, so I praise You because You rule.
