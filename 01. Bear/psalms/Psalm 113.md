# Psalm 113
*Psalm 113:1-3 NIV*

*Praise the Lord . Praise the Lord , you his servants; praise the name of the Lord . Let the name of the Lord be praised, both now and forevermore. From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets, the name of the Lord is to be praised.*

Just like Psalm 103 mentions that the distance between our transgressions and us is infinite, so here the Psalmist writes that God's praise is everywhere on the Earth.
In fact, I cannot imagine that God would lose in anything and in this case in losing out on praise, compared to the devil.
First of all, even if I could sum up all praise for everything except for God, all the praise would not conquer that if Christians praising Him, because the praise of His children is sincere, and the praise for idols, pop stars and movie stars is only temporary and superficial.
Second of all, everywhere in the world even nature praises God. Perhaps especially in those places where Your Name is not praised by people, like North Korea and the Middle East, there nature is at its best.

*Psalm 113:4-6 NIV*

*The Lord is exalted over all the nations, his glory above the heavens. Who is like the Lord our God, the One who sits enthroned on high,*

God amazes me again, by showing how much greater He is than all human beings. And I still do not even know how great He is, because He is too big to comprehend.
Knowing this will make me look down on people, in the sense that it is ridiculous how some people make idols out of other people, and that some people think of themselves as greater than others.

We are all human beings on the same Earth, our glory is in the same realm. Some might have billions of dollars, a number unfathomable for the poor, but God has that in the order of infinity.
God does not look down on us, but He could, given His position.
People among each other are like children arguing over who is the greatest among them.

*who stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth?*

The Lord even has to put effort in understanding us, so far is He above us!

What these rich and powerful people do not understand is that wealth, fame and power are given to them to fulfill a role. For some directors of companies, their power is given to them to lead the company in becoming better. For people in power in the government it is to lead the country and the people.
Instead, they are using it for their own good. While they were supposed to use it to become the greatest servant, they became the greatest abuser of power.

After the power given to them for their good work in the company, and the reward for that making them rich, they thought they had the same kind of power outside of the company.

*Psalm 113:7-9 NIV*

*He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes, with the princes of his people. He settles the childless woman in her home as a happy mother of children. Praise the Lord .*

The Lord does what is impossible, He raises the poor. Not only does He make them rich (probably not literally), but He gives them what they really need, and that is to be lifted up. Poor people, especially in those days, were people who had lost all confidence, in themselves and in society.
They had to lose face to beg for money, to sell their bodies, either as slaves or as prostitutes.
But with God they know they are being loved, that there really is a God Who loves them and that there really are people who love them, those who love God.
The childless woman who wants to have children for the right reason, that is someone to take care of and to love, will have many children in Christ, a relationship deeper than that of parental relationships and many more children than one can ever get.
