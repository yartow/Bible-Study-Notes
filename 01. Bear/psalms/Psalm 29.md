# Psalm 29
Psalm 29:7-9 NIV

The voice of the Lord strikes with flashes of lightning. The voice of the Lord shakes the desert; the Lord shakes the Desert of Kadesh. The voice of the Lord twists the oaks and strips the forests bare. And in his temple all cry, “Glory!”

What would it mean to shake a desert? There's only sand in there. Yet it is so grand and meedogenloos. God fears nothing, is greater than everything, and can hold everything in His hand, so my problems too!
