# Psalm 114
*Psalm 114:3-6 NIV*

*The sea looked and fled, the Jordan turned back; the mountains leaped like rams, the hills like lambs. Why was it, sea, that you fled? Why, Jordan, did you turn back? Why, mountains, did you leap like rams, you hills, like lambs?*

I think the Psalmist is talking about the splitting of the Red Sea, and the Jordan leaping back is a reference to the entrance to the Holy Land.

TODO OPZOEKEN
I do not understand why the mountains and hills are leaping, however.

*Psalm 114:7-8 NIV*

*Tremble, earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, who turned the rock into a pool, the hard rock into springs of water.*

The Earth should tremble for the Lord, because He can change everything, from the impossible to the possible. The rock he can change into a pool, and the *hard* rock he can change into a spring! 
A rock is always going to be a rock, never changing, unless the Lord touches it. In the same way those of us who want to stay where we are, should be especially be afraid of God, because when he changes you, the change will be as big as with the rock.
