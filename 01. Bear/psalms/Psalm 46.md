# Psalm 46
*Psalm 46:1-3 NIV*

*God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.*
*Therefore we will not fear,*
*though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,*
*though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.*

Whatever happens here in Earth, we are not afraid, because we know that the Earth itself trembles at hearing the Lord's voice.
We are not afraid of anything in life, because only death can cease life and death is conquered by Jesus Christ.

*Psalm 46:4-6 NIV*

*There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,*
*the holy place where the Most High dwells.*
*God is within her, she will not fall;*
*God will help her at break of day.*
*Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall;*
*he lifts his voice, the earth melts.*

*Psalm 46:8-10 NIV*

*Come and see what the Lord has done,*
*All the desolations he has brought on the earth.*
*He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth.*
*He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the shields with fire.*
*He says, “Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.”*

You can only see how powerful God really is, when you are still. Things you might have credited people for, technology or peace treaties and coincidence, are all controlled by God. If it were not for God, people would never have invented things.

*Psalm 46:11 NIV*

*The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.*

God is always with us and He protects us.
