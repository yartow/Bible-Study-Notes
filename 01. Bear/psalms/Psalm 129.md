# Psalm 129
*“They have greatly oppressed me from my youth,” let Israel say; “they have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me. Plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long. But the Lord is righteous; he has cut me free from the cords of the wicked.”*
*Psalm 129:1-4 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.129.1-4.NIV*

No, they have not been able to gain victory over me. The devil has tried to keep me away from You all of my life, but he has not succeeded, thanks to Your help, because you have always stood by my side.
Indeed, the devil has made its marks in my life, which make it hard for me to look at myself or accept myself, because I gave in to him and my desires. And also because of the people I have hurt and have even led away from You, my Lord.
I know You are greatly saddened by this, and will always be, but I also know You accept me as I am right now.

*May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame. May they be like grass on the roof, which withers before it can grow; a reaper cannot fill his hands with it, nor one who gathers fill his arms.*

Those who hate Zion are at this moment the Muslims, but most of the West as well. All who do not belong to You, God Almighty, are against Zion as well.
May they miss out on Your blessing as well, if they stubbornly choose to follow their own path. May they be looking for their blessing in the wrong places and never be satiated.

*May those who pass by not say to them, “The blessing of the Lord be on you; we bless you in the name of the Lord .”*
*Psalm 129:5-8 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.129.5-8.NIV*

If they miss out on Your blessing everywhere, they will fail at everything and miss out on Your purpose. If that is needed, to either punish them or make them realize they need your blessing, then I pray with all my might that they be punished.
