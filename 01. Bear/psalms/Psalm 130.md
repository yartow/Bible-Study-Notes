# Psalm 130
*Out of the depths I cry to you, Lord ; Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy.*
*Psalm 130:1-2 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.130.1-2.NIV*

Even in the darkest periods of my life, I have called to You, and even though I did not hear an answer, I see now that You have been there with me all the time. Your plan was set in motion, it has always been, and You were listening all the time as well.

*If you, Lord , kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand? But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can, with reverence, serve you.*
*Psalm 130:3-4 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.130.3-4.NIV*

I love You, Lord, for You loved me first and You showed me what forgiveness is. You showed me how great Your forgiveness is, I can never equal that. That alone makes me look at You with reverence.
I serve You, not out of guilt, even though I owe You more than my whole life, but out of love for Your forgiveness.
Teach me how to forgive my enemies from the past and future.

The Dutch Statenvertaling has written that You have forgiven us, so that we can revere You. That is what I mean as well. 

*I wait for the Lord , my whole being waits, and in his word I put my hope. I wait for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning, more than watchmen wait for the morning.*
*Psalm 130:5-6 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/psa.130.5-6.NIV*

Just like the psalmist, I wait for the Lord as well, with my whole body and mind and spirit. Every part of me hopes that today will be the last day for me here in earth.
I know I can never reach the top of the world. No missionary has ever converted a whole country, let alone the world and solved all of the world's problems, on finance, poverty, education, peace and the like. Neither will I, therefore I have a little piece with leaving this world today.
I know not everyone has heard about You yet, so You will not come today, but my hope is there.

I wait for You more than the watchmen wait for the morning. The watchmen only wait for he morning because their shift is over and they can rest and sleep after that. But they do not enjoy the morning itself.
I wait for You knowing I will get rest like You intended for us, but I wait to see You face to face and to meet all other people in heaven.
