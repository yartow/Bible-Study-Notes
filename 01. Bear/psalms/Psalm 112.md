# Psalm 112
*Psalm 112:1-5 NIV*

*Praise the Lord . Blessed are those who fear the Lord , who find great delight in his commands.*

There is a reason why this line is written separately from the second, and it is not only because of the acrostic.
The second line will tell of the children of those who fear the Lord, but even without children, the one who fears God is blessed. Fearing God is not the only requirement, but funding great delight in God's commands as well. It is not so much of a requirement as it is a blessing.
It seems contradictory, one needs to be blessed in order to be blessed. But one can also see it like this, only those who had fun at the party, were blessed.
So this verse means in other words, it is not enough to fear the Lord (or merely abide by His rules), one needs to delight in it as well. Only then you have really understood what it means to fear the Lord.

*Their children will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed. Wealth and riches are in their houses, and their righteousness endures forever.*

I can see this in two ways. The people here who are mighty, had righteous fathers, or the righteous fathers will have mighty children. Unfortunately both I do not see in this world to be always true.
If I look at the next line, about wealth and riches and a forever lasting righteousness, perhaps that one is true. Righteous and God-fearing parents usually have righteous children as well, though not always believers. As for wealth, not material wealth per se, but in other forms as well, I see it as well. Then again I have never been to a really poor country and never met really poor people.

**Even in darkness light dawns for the upright, for those who are gracious and compassionate and righteous.**

The upright know that You, God, will protect them. They know they have done right even if it seemed wrong in the eyes of the world. And it is more than just being upright, it is being gracious, compassionate and righteous as well. In my words, giving people something when they do not deserve it, caring about people and trying to help them, and doing what is right and giving people what they deserve.

*Good will come to those who are generous and lend freely, who conduct their affairs with justice.*

No matter what your situation is right now, whether you are poor or rich, this last line is valid for everyone. *Good will come to those who are generous and lend freely, who conduct their affairs with justice.*
Help me to be generous, Lord, and to keep being just in everything I do.

*Psalm 112:6-9 NIV*

*Surely the righteous will never be shaken; they will be remembered forever. They will have no fear of bad news; their hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord .*

I think that is a good definition of steadfast. *They will have no fear of bad news*. 
Thank You, Lord, for giving me a steadfast heart. Thank You that I may trust in You and that you have built up my trust by never letting me down. I know that I can count on You as I have always done. You will never let me down.
Help me now too, oh Lord, in staying steadfast for the rest of my life, for the great test to come, which must occur for me to be able to grow.

*Their hearts are secure, they will have no fear; in the end they will look in triumph on their foes.*

The security of their hearts is not because of the self-confidence, but rather because their God-confidence. You need God because the trials you are facing are inhuman. There is no way a human being would be victorious until the end. Who knows what the end is, when that will come? So we think not in terms of the end or how long it will take. We live day by day on God's power and know that we will make it until the end as long as we trust on Him.

*They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor, their righteousness endures forever; their horn will be lifted high in honor.*

If one freely scatters gifts to the poor, unless het is rich, it must cost him quite a lot. The really generous person is one who does not own much and still does this. He himself must think how he is going to survive now, but does not worry about it, because God will provide.
I do not think everyone is supposed to live like this, like Jesus did, wandering around, giving everything he had to the poor. I know some of us have talents to use at work to earn money for the Church, and others have good ways of spreading the gospel at church, still others can teach others or learn from them at work. These are all valid reasons to daily go to work instead of living free on the streets. But some may be hiding behind the reason of safety, because it is safer not to give everything away to the poor.
In any case, those who do so, their horn will be raised high in honor.

**Psalm 112:10 NIV**

*The wicked will see and be vexed, they will gnash their teeth and waste away; the longings of the wicked will come to nothing.*

What is remarkable about the wicked is that they are always longing for something, even if it is not material. The difference between the wicked and the good is that the wicked surrender themselves to what they want and they want to obtain this whatever the cost, even at the cost of others.
The good, or righteous, on the other hand will patiently wait for Your time. Your time is the right time for us to receive what we need.
Lastly, the longings of the wicked come to nothing. I think this means that whatever it is the wicked are longing for, eventually they will not get it. They might long for wealth and they might even get rich, but they will never be satisfied.
Satisfaction is always more important than whatever one has.
