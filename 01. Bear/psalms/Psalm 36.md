# Psalm 36
*Psalm 36:1 NIV* 

*I have a message from God in my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked: There is no fear of God before their eyes.* 

What is on my heart, from God and for others?
It is to teach what is good in God's eyes and what is right in Christian discussions.

*Psalm 36:2-4 NIV* 

*In their own eyes they flatter themselves too much to detect or hate their sin.*
*The words of their mouths are wicked and deceitful; they fail to act wisely or do good. Even on their beds they plot evil; they commit themselves to a sinful course and do not reject what is wrong.* 

Please Lord, let me be patient with those who sin and do not even see it.
Help me to forgive those who speak bad about You and Your people. Who spend their lives of destroying Your work.

*Psalm 36:5-9 NIV* 

*Your love, Lord , reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies. Your righteousness is like the highest mountains, your justice like the great deep.*
*You, Lord , preserve both people and animals. How priceless is your unfailing love, O God!*
*People take refuge in the shadow of your wings. They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights.* 

But Lord, let us be near You, no matter what happens, how much we are attacked, whether my enemies are punished or not, let me stay near You.
I know I have a different home than them, I know where I belong and Who is my Master.

*For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.* 

In Your light we see light. That is the reason why we should not focus ourselves on all these people, who do wrong and deserve punishment. We cannot see though Your eyes, and You, I think, have not given our eyes to only see the negative in this world, but rather to enjoy what is good.

*Psalm 36:10-12 NIV* 

*Continue your love to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart. May the foot of the proud not come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.*
*See how the evildoers lie fallenâ€” thrown down, not able to rise!*
 
 
I only pray, Lord, that You do not leave me, that nothing will come between You and me.
