# Isaiah 15
**“A prophecy against Moab:** 
*Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Kir in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Dibon goes up to its temple, to its high places to weep; Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba. Every head is shaved and every beard cut off. In the streets they wear sackcloth; on the roofs and in the public squares they all wail, prostrate with weeping. Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz.* 

I cannot determine the tone with which this is written. Is it an objective tone of mere observations? I think not, because God does say in the next verse that His heart cries out over Moab.
God seems like an anguished father who is reluctantly punishing his children, and He probably is, though the Moabites are not His children, but they still are His creation. 

*Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out, and their hearts are faint.* 

This is a part that strikes me. I can imagine an image of men with weapons, physically strong enough to fight, but spiritually (actually, mentally and emotionally) drained because of having seen all the bloodshed in their own people. What is the use of fighting? For whom are they still fighting? The cause is gone. There is no power in their hearts anymore.

*My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath Shelishiyah. They go up the hill to Luhith, weeping as they go; on the road to Horonaim they lament their destruction.*

The casualties are spread as far as the hills and roads described above here. It seems like they cannot even go to other places without being reminded of 

*The waters of Nimrim are dried up and the grass is withered; the vegetation is gone and nothing green is left. So the wealth they have acquired and stored up they carry away over the Ravine of the Poplars. Their outcry echoes along the border of Moab; their wailing reaches as far as Eglaim, their lamentation as far as Beer Elim. The waters of Dimon are full of blood, but I will bring still more upon Dimon — a lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon those who remain in the land.”*
