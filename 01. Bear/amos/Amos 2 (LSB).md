# Amos 2 (LSB)
Thus says Yahweh,
“For three transgressions of Moab and for four
I will not turn back its punishment
Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime.
2 
So I will send fire upon Moab,
And it will consume the citadels of Kerioth;
And Moab will die amid great rumbling,
Amid a loud shout and the sound of a trumpet.
3 
I will also cut off the judge from her midst
And kill all her princes with him,” says Yahweh.
PUNISHMENT ON JUDAH AND ISRAEL
4 
Thus says Yahweh,
“For three transgressions of Judah and for four
I will not turn back its punishment
Because they rejected the law of Yahweh
And have not kept His statutes;
Their falsehood also has led them astray,
That which their fathers walked after.
5 
So I will send fire upon Judah,
And it will consume the citadels of Jerusalem.”
6 
Thus says Yahweh,
“For three transgressions of Israel and for four
I will not turn back its punishment
Because they sell the righteous for money
And the needy for a pair of sandals.
7 
These who pant after the very dust of the earth on the head of the poor
Also turn aside the way of the humble;
And a man and his father go to the same young woman
In order to profane My holy name.
8 
On garments taken as pledges they stretch out beside every altar,
And in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined.

9 
“Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them,
Though his height was like the height of cedars,
And he was strong as the oaks;
I even destroyed his fruit above and his root below.
10 
And it was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt,
And I led you in the wilderness forty years
That you might take possession of the land of the Amorite.
11 
Then I raised up some of your sons to be prophets
And some of your choice men to be Nazirites.
Is this not so, O sons of Israel?” declares Yahweh.
12 
“But you made the Nazirites drink wine,
And you commanded the prophets saying, ‘You shall not prophesy!’
13 
Behold, I am weighted down beneath you
As a wagon is weighted down when filled with sheaves.
14 
So flight will perish from the swift,
And the strong will not instill his power with courage,
Nor will the mighty man make his life escape.
15 
He who grasps the bow will not stand his ground,
The swift of foot will not escape,
Nor will he who rides the horse make his life escape.
16 
Even the most courageous of heart among the mighty men will flee naked in that day,” declares Yahweh.
