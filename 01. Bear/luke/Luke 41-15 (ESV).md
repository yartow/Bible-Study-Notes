# Luke 4:1-15 (ESV) 
**The Temptation of Jesus** 
*1 And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness 2 for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days. And when they were ended, he was hungry. 3 The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.” 4 And Jesus answered him, “It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone.’” 5 And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, 6 and said to him, “To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. 7 If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.” 8 And Jesus answered him, “It is written,* 
*“‘You shall worship the Lord your God,* 
*and him only shall you serve.’”* 
*9 And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, 10 for it is written,* 
*“‘He will command his angels concerning you,* 
*to guard you,’* 
*11 and* 
*“‘On their hands they will bear you up,* 
*lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”* 

Apparently the devil knew about Jesus even in the days of David, who wrote these words in the Psalms 91:11-12. So even he had the wisdom to interpret the words for what they are. But we must know that this wisdom was given to the Satan by God, for even the Satan cannot understand the Bible if God does not permit him. So it is then not exactly clear whether the Satan understood the prophecy of the serpent being killed by the woman's seed. 
It is possible that the Satan did not know he was going to lose because Daniel had not been written yet. It is even possible that he did not understand what was written Isaiah 53 about the lamb that was slaughtered and crucified to the wood. Perhaps he did not even realize this until Jesus said His last words "It is done" and breathed his last breath, or maybe even after this moment when he did not see the spirit of Jesus entering his realm, that is hell, because Jesus broke the power of sin itself and all the sin that was laid upon Him and sin could hurt Him no more nor send Him to hell. 
At that moment the devil must have realized that it was a mistake to put Jesus on the cross and regretted his actions and must have cursed his inability to understand all the prophecies concerning Jesus in the Old Testament. 

*12 And Jesus answered him, “It is said, You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’” 13 And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.* 

*Every* temptation means that the devil had used *all* of his techniques. He had nothing left with which he could possible deceive Jesus Christ. 
I think we can assume the devil tried Jesus three times. Of course it could have been that the devil asked Jesus more than three times, but I think we can also assume that he has some intelligence and will not waste his efforts on doing things that have no effect. With this I mean that the devil used at least three techniques and when these did not work, he did not continue to try him, but he departed from Jesus. In the same way I am reasoning that when the devil tried the first technique of going for Jesus' flesh, by targeting his hunger, but when that did not work, I presume the devil knew as well that he did not have to tempt Jesus with anything other fleshly, such as lust for women or other food. Jesus' confident answers and quotations from the Bible proved that He was more willing to die than to submit or obey to the devil in any way. 

The three techniques I see here that the devil is using are not simply a targeting of Jesus' longing for his flesh, pleasure (adrenaline by jumping off a cliff to test the boundaries) and power, and I also would not call these superlative as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temptation_of_Christ) is telling us, because each temptation is not worth more than the prior perse. 
**The first technique.** From what I see, is that the devil first challenges Jesus to turn stone into bread. It rather seems like a command, the way in which the devil tells Jesus to do this, but it is a challenge, because he start his sentence with "if You are the Son of God". Jesus knows He does not have to prove anything and even though He can turn bread into stone—which would not be a sin in itself—it would not be the best thing to do. What is better than not doing a sin, is to do something good, and rejecting the devil is a good thing—even if the devil tells you to do a good thing, for the devil always has a bad intention. 
The devil could tell you for example to cross the street and help the lady that is being robbed and if you know it is the devil telling you this, but you see nothing wrong with that "command" from the devil, and you go cross the street, you might be hit by a truck or you might be killed by these robbers. The guiding principe is that we must ignore what the devil is telling us. 
Now if you think that the devil is so crafty to know that some of us always do the opposite of what he asks, and so he will start telling you to do the right thing, we are in luck, because the devil is not able to do this, i.e. telling us to do good things. The devil is the very definition of evil itself. Whatever he does, is evil, or rather yet, he is evil himself and he is the father of lies, which does not mean that he is the best liar, but that he is the creator of lies. The devil can of course say something factually about the temperature, which is not a lie, but his whole sentence or argument would be a lie. For example, he could tell a woman: "It is very hot today, so you should wear this bare shouldered piece of clothing and this shorter skirt to allow for more coolness." Now it might be true that less clothing will keep you cooler, but the "lie"—not as defined by the dictionary as something being true or not—is in the fact that he presents this as if this is good for you. 
So the devil is not able to tell us to do good things and use reverse psychology, fortunately, so we can simply ignore him without worries and listen only to what God tells us to do. 

**The second technique.** Because the first technique did not work, Jesus would not simply do something just because the devil asks and inciting Jesus to prove Himself did not help either, the devil now *offers* Jesus something in return. He offers Him the world and everything in it. 

**The third technique.**
#todo/nogaftemaken In the third technique the devil tries to tempt Jesus with a Bible verse in return and mislead Jesus. 

**The three techniques – overview**
Challenging: you can't do this + tempting: you're hungry, you want this 
Tempting: so much you're going to get, for so little, just a little worship 
Challenging: you can do this + tempting: it's fun 

The three temptations are clear, but the second layer beneath that is 
* you can't do this -> reverse psychology 
* you *can* do this, why don't you try out? 
* it's so easy, look at what you'll get 
These are same three strategies the devil used in Genesis 3 when tempting Eve. 

Now we should also notice that the devil is willing to offer Jesus the world. Assuming that the devil did not know of God's plan to save the world through the sacrifice of Jesus—for otherwise the devil would not have killed Jesus—why would the devil give away everything he has? What would he gain by this? We know, in hindsight of course, that Jesus is the crux—no pun intended—of the salvation of mankind. If the devil could get Jesus to sin, God's wrath would be poured out over all mankind instead of on Jesus alone and all people would be doomed to hell, even those living before Jesus for they were only saved by the crediting of righteousness, which still needed to be debited by Jesus' sacrifice. 
But if the devil did not know all this, why would he give up his only domain and then even let his domain be ruled by God, which would make mankind better. There would be no benefit in that for him. 
It is because the devil *does* get one thing in return, which is the worship of Jesus. Everything material here on Earth, all the kingdoms and its riches, authority over the people and the people's glory, are worth nothing to the devil—although likes to be worshipped. His only goal is to become like God and what could be better than to be worshipped by God Himself which would make him the new God. 

**Example.** Tell someone you want to convert him. Now you are friendly, because you actually like him, but will this person be susceptible to your friendliness? No, he would rather be suspicious. 

So when we know what the devil tries to do, the techniques he uses, which weaknesses he targets, and why he wants this, it becomes much easier for us to resist him. #todo/nogaftemaken Make summary and overview of these techniques and hidden layer. 

**Jesus Begins His Ministry** 
*14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and a report about him went out through all the surrounding country. 15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.* 

Why would this verse say that Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit. Was He not already full of the Spirit, before this test and even before His baptism? Perhaps so, and perhaps it was even completely full. No test on Earth could let Jesus become fuller of the Spirit because Jesus Christ's connection with the Holy Spirit was One, they are part of the Trinity. 
For normal human beings this verse would have made sense. After a test, after having been emptied and stripped of oneself, one's real power is shown, and not their weakness. This is what some people think, but it is not true for two reasons. 
The first example is shown in the move #tags/movies *G.I. Jane*. In this movie see that the protagonist, played by #tags/famouspeople Demi Moore, loses "everything" she has got. She is not accepted by her fellow soldiers, they do not help her, she fails the physical tests, but then her willpower takes over and through that, she trains even harder than others. She cuts her hair and eventually she is accepted. This is not a power that filled her, it is that when everything is stripped away, only willpower remains, and that can refill one with new power. This is what this movie is trying to say. 
The real thing is, however, she did not do it on her own. She was taken out of the corps through a bureaucratic decision and gave up the fight. It was only through the love and comfort of her husband that she regained the courage to start the fight again to rejoin the corps. 
A second example of why this theory is not true can be found in the movie the *The Deer Hunter* #tags/movies# 
After three former soldiers having been stripped away of everything in life, through the torture during imprisonment by the *Khmer Rouge* in Cambodia, #todo/opzoeken Killing Fields? Ook Cambodja? 
, one of the protagonists, having lost both his legs and his wife and his money, has nothing left and eventually turns to suicide #todo/opzoeken 
The other protagonist lost his mind and his memory, and did not even recognize his partner from the war. The little bit he had left of himself does not help him or give him power at all. His willpower was such a feeble flickering flame that was only kept alive by the adrenaline rush of playing Russian Roulette, which eventually killed him. 
He was almost brought back when the third protagonist talked him back into it, though. 
These examples show that when one is emptied not even willpower can save him. It is always an external source that provides one with power. 

Now did Jesus empty Himself from everything, including the Holy Spirit, so that only His willpower was left? That is hard to say, but even if it were, Jesus would not have a smoldering wick or a flickering flame left, but still a burning passion for God and a pure mind.
