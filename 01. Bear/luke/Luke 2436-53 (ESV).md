Luke 24:36-53 (ESV) 
**Jesus Appears to His Disciples**
*36 As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, “Peace to you!” 37 But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. 38 And he said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? 39 See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.” 40 And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. 41 And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?” 42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish, 43 and he took it and ate before them.*

*44 Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the ::Psalms:: must be fulfilled.” 45 ::Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,::*

The disciples knew some parts of the Old Testament but they could not relate these to the past events, such as Jesus' anger in the temple and that it was foretold in the Psalms #todo/opzoeken . Now, however, Jesus *opened* their minds to *understand* the Scriptures. This means that understanding Scripture is not something we should take for granted. It is something that is given by God in order to relate Old Testament texts with Jesus and to hear Him or in other words relate the Bible with our own lives. 
My son, and my wife as well, always wonder how I can write so much on a single verse. Though I am not a humble person, I know that in this field, there is nothing I can do except for expressing my gratitude to God for giving me what to write. It is 100% grace. 
Though I can write stuff, it would be nonsense, not from the Spirit, having no impact whatsoever on anyone who would be reading this if it were from myself. But if it from God I see relations between the text in the Bible and life, between the Bible and politics and movies. Who would have thought that the Bible is so actual and applicable in all fields of life? No one can see these relationships except for the Holy Spirit. God the Father knows and leads all thoughts in man's mind and it *all* works together (cf. Romans 8:28). His Bible is a blueprint for how people behaved in ancient and classic times, and how they behaved in industrial and post-modern times—the latter is the one in which we live right now. 
Once again, from the Bible, from Ecclesiastes, nothing is new under the sun. The Renaissance, industrial times and post-modernism seem to be primers on the timeline of history, but they are not. The Bible speaks of events repeatedly and cyclicly returning in multiple places, such as Judges, but also is the Babylonian Exile and the period they lived in Persia not a form of Renaissance, where they experienced things from the past again (cf. their time in Egypt in the book of Exodus)? 
Are industrial times not clearly visible in the periods when iron was used more broadly instead of bronze, such as when the Israelites in the book of Judges were afraid of the ... #todo/opzoeken when Deborah led the Israelites #todo/nogaftemaken 
This continues all the way to Micah who then speaks of an industrial and economic boom (cf. David Pawson's explanation in his book #tags/books *Unlocking the Bible*). 
Post-modernism is clearly visible in the sexually immoral practices of the Greeks and Romans. 

*46 and said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, 47 and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. 48 You are witnesses of these things. 49 And behold, I am sending the ::promise:: of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”*



**The Ascension**
*50 And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them. 51 While he blessed them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven. 52 And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, 53 and were continually in the temple blessing God.*
