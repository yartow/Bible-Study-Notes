# 3 John (ESV) 
***Greeting***
*1 The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.*
*2 Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, as it goes well with your soul. 3 For I rejoiced greatly when the brothers came and testified to your truth, as indeed you are walking in the truth.*

Normally I would say that it is clear whether one's health is doing well, but it is unclear to us whether one's soul is doing well. John, however, does the opposite. He can see that Gaius' soul is doing well for he testified to the truth by his actions. This is the only way for others to recognize fellow Christians. 

*4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.*

The first priority is of course that one's soul is doing well. John even calls them his children, even though they were more likely to be Paul's protégés. Since Paul and John are both disciples of the same Lord and master Jesus Christ, however, he can call them his protégés, or children in this case, as well.  

***Support and Opposition***
*5 Beloved, it is a faithful thing you do in all your efforts for these brothers, strangers as they are, 6 who testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their journey in a manner worthy of God.*

It is big appreciation to get a commendation from the Apostle John for hosting a few missionaries. What is perhaps thought of mere hospitality in these days to some, may have been a big sacrifice in the past. We see from most archeological findings that houses were not as large as they are right now and in The Netherlands at least multiple children slept in the same bed and definitely in the same room. Poverty was more common than it is now and being able to host or willing to sacrifice one's own income to host Christian missionaries was a big deal at that time. 
Also, I do not know about how these missionaries were entertained if the man had to go out for work, for in these times it was common that the woman stayed at home and a homemaker #todo/opzoeken/engels housewife and it was not common that the missionaries were kept in the house alone with the wife, especially not if these were strangers. 
Even in these days this is not very common, although there is much more trust towards strangers on the one side, but there is a much bigger need to isolation and a much bigger use and need to privacy. 
The work that Gaius and people like him are doing is much greater than this sacrifice of theirs, it is sending the brothers on a journey *in a manner worthy of God*. #todo/nogaftemaken  

*7 For they have gone out for the sake of the name, ::accepting nothing from the Gentiles::.*

There is a reason why these missionaries needed help from the Christian and that is because they accepted nothing from the Gentiles. Now why would they not accept help from Gentile people or organizations which could have the right morals as well. Perhaps it is just like Abraham and David's attitude who did not accept anything (Footnote: Abraham did not accept any treasure from the five kings surrounding Salem #todo/opzoeken because he did not want anyone to be able to say that they aided in his wealth but that is was God alone. He also did not accept the grave for him and his future generations without charge, but perhaps for another reason #todo/opzoeken . David did not accept the location of the wine press #todo/opzoeken  for free, not even as a gift from a citizen who had the utmost respect for him, because David wanted this gift to be his only.), not only from gentiles but also not from a fellow Israelite in David's case. There could have been many reasons for this, such as one's neutrality and the influence exerted on one's autonomy, but the main reason would be, in my opinion, that they wanted to fully trust on God to provide for anything they needed. 
Some Christians have the same attitude and refuse even to tell or ask others about their problems, such as George Müller #tags/famouspeople/christian/missionaries who simply trusted on God's provision even for his daily bread. 
What we *do* know, is that they did this for the sake of Jesus' Name. Not only the work, which is of course always done in His Name, but even the method of accepting nothing.

*8 Therefore we ought to support people like these, that we may be ::fellow:: workers for the truth.*

**"Therefore".** See the last line on the notes on verse 7. We ought to support people who do things for Jesus' sake. 
We should note that aiding these people makes us *fellow* workers for the ministry. Even if one *only* receives these missionaries and is hospitable to them, he has been a minister himself.

*9 I have written something to the church, but Diotrephes, who likes to put himself first, does not acknowledge our authority. 10 So if I come, I will bring up what he is doing, talking wicked nonsense against us. And not content with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers, and also stops those who want to and puts them out of the church.*

The wickedness of people like Diothrephes is amazing. I simply cannot understand why anyone would ever do the things he did, just so that he receives full attention or attains his power. I understand he does not acknowledge the apostles' authority, for if he did, he had to obey what they said. For this reason he needs to say wicked things about the apostles. Perhaps it is from people like he who made up the stories that Jesus' divinity was made up by the apostles and that Jesus never said He was God Himself. 
But why would he not allow these Christian brothers to enter his church, his house or any other house? And why would the punishment for doing so, but so harsh? Perhaps this is because these missionaries would tell the truth and spread the real Gospel and the real teachings concerning elders and other doctrines and then Diotrephes would #todo/opzoeken/engels door de mand zakken. show his real side. 
Another reason would be that he simply does not feel like hosting (perhaps unknown) missionaries because he does not trust them, he is afraid they might steal something, he is not hospitable or he does not want to pay for their living expenses. A good reason why he would not let others do this then, is to make himself look good. For if others are willing to do what he does not, then this will make him look bad. 

*11 Beloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God.*

There are so many people who do good who are not Christian and thus not **from God**. #todo/nogaftemaken How do we explain that? Jesus said that none is good ( #todo/opzoeken/reference Matthew ?) except for God. No one can *be* good, but some can *do* good. These people are not necessarily *from* God in the sense that they are Christians, but still they can be sent by God. Many people have been sent by God to come across our paths, even though they are not or never will be Christians, in order to teach us something (cf. Romans 9:11? the vessels as a purpose to save other vessels). #todo/nogaftemaken  

*12 Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself. We also add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.*

John adds his own testimony concerning **Demetrius**. It is strange to see how in a short letter, not even concerning him, Demetrius is still praised. It is as if John inserted this *post scriptum*-like message because he remembered at the end of his letter and realized he did not have enough time or paper left to write on, but thought it important enough to write down. This shows that John wanted to give credit to whom credit was due, as Paul has always done so as well. 
This also shows the concern he had for the churches he had visited or founded and that he had not forgotten about the people nor their names. A letter is worth so much because it lets people know that someone has not forgotten about them. This is an example that we should follow, if only by a text message or an e-mail. However, the more effort is put into it, the more a message is appreciated. Realizing then that the writing of a message took a big amount of time, for one needed to think about what he was going to write, and the pen needed to be dipped in ink all the time, and the writing on parchment was not smooth at all, especially not with a pen made of a goose's feather, and the letter had to be sealed and sent—all of this made it all the more appreciable to receive a letter. 

As an update to the notes above, *MacSBNnkjv* notes that Demetrius was the one who passed along this letter to this congregation. This is probably true, because these people were mentioned at the end of the letter according to the "conventional letter form of the contemporary Greco-Roman world".

***Final Greetings***
*13 I had much to write to you, but I would rather not write with pen and ink. 14 I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face.*

See notes on 2 John 12. 

*15 Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends, ::each by name::.*

John really wants each person to be greeted as in "Phoebe, John greets you; Andrew, John greets you." This, of course, would be much more personal—as is clearly John's purpose with this last three verses—than a reading of this letter to the whole congregation and an ending with "John greets all of you." However, this would only be valid if John actually knew each one of them by name. We do not know to which congregation this letter was written (although it probably was *from* Ephesus), how big this congregation was and whether John knew everyone, for there could have been new church members after John had left or since they last communicated. Either way, his purpose is clear and the method he uses, is an efficient one for him—who perhaps did not have much time or perhaps even freedom if he wrote this from the rock island #todo/opzoeken —and an effective one for the congregation.
