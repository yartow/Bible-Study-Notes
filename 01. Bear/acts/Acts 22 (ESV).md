# Acts 22 (ESV)
*1 “Brothers and fathers, hear the defense that I now make before you.”*

Note that Paul addresses the Jews as family members and this is not only to satisfy the people, but because he actually means it. All throughout Acts, though written by Luke, but in Paul's speeches as well, Paul addresses the Jews as brothers (#todo/opzoeken does he do this with the Gentiles as well? If so, then he is referring to their status in Jesus Christ) even though Paul is a Christian now. 

*2 And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language, they became even more quiet. And he said:*

The Jews were willing to listen a bit more attentively because they now knew Paul was actually Jewish and could even speak their language, despite being born abroad. This only means that the people *simply believed* the Jews from Asia who said that Paul was one to tell people to give up their Jewish roots. A simple faith is good, but not if one believes the wrong things. This also says something about the people themselves, who were rioters, looters or wicked people from the rabble. Apparently they listened and believed the Jews from Asia and acted upon their emotions, including beating Paul, even before confirming whether it was true what they said. None the less could be said of those who were cheering on the crucifixion of Jesus, Who would die for them. Paul too would eventually die, but not for these people, he would die for Jesus, Who is good and had given His life for him. Jesus, however, would die for these people, who were wicked and had given Him nothing. 
This is what Paul was referring to when he wrote in Romans 5:6-8: 
> *6 For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. 7 For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die— 8 but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.*  

*3 “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as all of you are this day. 4 I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women, 5 as the high priest and the whole council of elders can bear me witness.*

The high priest at the time of Paul's conversion, Caiaphas in 32 AD, would surely know of Paul as he was known throughout all of Jerusalem according to Acts 9 and Ananias (not the high priest) in Syria knew him and his reputation (also repeated in Galatians 1:23). Paul even received letters and permission from this high priest. The high priest across Paul in Acts 22, however, was Ananias might not have been so acquainted with Paul as the other high priests were.

*From them I received letters to the brothers, and I journeyed toward Damascus to take those also who were there and ::bring them in bonds to Jerusalem:: to be punished.*

Why would the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem have the right to arrest Jews in Damascus, which is even outside of Israel? Would that not be not only outside of Israel's jurisdiction but also against the Law of the Roman Empire? For sure the Sanhedrin had the right to deal with its own people and maintain order in their own way. The Romans allowed this to prevent an uprising of the people and so that they would need less people stationed abroad. Perhaps Israel did not exist anymore as a state, because everything belonged to the Roman empire. The four sons of Herod who were tetrarchs of the four parts that Israel was split into for administrative purposes, but in fact the Jews were free to travel wherever they wanted. Because the Romans wanted "peace" in the Roman fashion (*Pax Romana*) they let the people make their own rules and implement their own police and execute their own punishments except for the capital punishment. The Sanhedrin would be in charge of all of this, as it had been before the Roman ~inquisition~ #todo/opzoeken/engels invasion? . Most likely the Romans would have made an agreement that the Sanhedrin would take care of (or control) the Jewish people, not defining where those Jews would be. This would allow them then to go as far as Asia and Greece to arrest Jews. Or perhaps the area was defined, and included Israel and Syria for example, perhaps because these were neighboring countries. 

In this verse we also see the cruelty of Paul—which, again, the Sadducee Sanhedrin should have known—in the fact that he takes the Christians back to Jerusalem *in bonds* to be tried as if they were severe criminals. It is almost like how radical Muslims persecutes apostates and other enemies these days. 

*6 “As I was on my way and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone around me. 7 And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’ 8 And I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me, ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.’*

Though Luke was aware of what he wrote in Acts 9, he still added the words "of Nazareth" to Jesus' original words. Perhaps he did this because he quoted Paul verbatim, if he were there at all to hear Paul speak. Apparently Paul added these words to emphasize Jesus' affiliation with his Jewish roots although everyone there should already know that Jesus was a Jew. 

*9 Now those who were with me saw the light but did not understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me. 10 And I said, What shall I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, ‘Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.’ 11 And since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.*
*12 “And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,*

In Acts 9 Luke did not mention that Ananias was a devout man *according to the law* and well spoken of *by all the Jews*. 

*13 came to me, and standing by me said to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight.’ And at that very hour I received my sight and saw him. 14 And he said, The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth; 15 for you will be a witness for him to everyone of what you have seen and heard.*

This part too where Ananias mentions "the God of our fathers" which is clearly Yahweh and not some other God, is not described in Acts 9. It is clear that Paul, though he is not making up what Ananias said, wants to make clear to the Jews that the God of the Christians is the same God as that of the Jews and that this is a revelation just like the prophets of the Old Testament had. However, they did not believe and treated Paul in the same way they treated the prophets (cf. Matthew 5:10-12). 

*16 And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.’*
*17 “When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance 18 and saw him saying to me, Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’*

Paul also uses the argument of revelation twice when he describes the light and the voice from heaven and God's voice here in verse 17. 

*19 And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you.*

In verse 19 Paul also uses the argument of what changed him from being a persecutor of Christians to becoming himself after seeing the truth, as described in verses 4 and 20. 

*20 And when the blood of Stephen your witness was being shed, I myself was standing by and approving and watching over the garments of those who killed him.’*

Here is another thing that should relatively fresh in the memories of the members of the Sanhedrin—for it had been approximately 23 years or more 

*21 And he said to me, ‘Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’”*

So summarizing, Paul tries to convince his Jewish audience that 
1. ::Christianity follows the same God as the Jews do and Paul still considers himself part of the Jewish family::
2. ::Nothing could cause such an extreme change in a wicked man such as Paul from being a persecutor to becoming an Evangelist of Christianity unless there was a truth revealed to him.:: 
3. ::This truth was revealed to him in supernatural ways.:: 

Paul already predicted that the Jews would not believe him and so by their actions in the following verses they confirmed his words. Still, however, he spent this last effort (in Jerusalem) to convince the crowd of following Jesus and to repent and to welcome them to the Father, which serves as an example to us in how to treat our enemies. 

***Paul and the Roman Tribune***
*22 Up to this word they listened to him. Then they raised their voices and said, “Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he should not be allowed to live.” 23 And as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,*

Again, Luke describes a minor detail here, but perhaps with the purpose of creating suspense. This also describes the way the people were stirring up the situation. Whereas the Jews would take off their cloaks and put them on the ground so that not Jesus', but His donkey's feet would not touch the dust, the people would now fling up the dust into the air, perhaps to fling dust against Paul or to create some sort of dust cloud, which one way or the other, would get attention. 

*24 the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, saying that he should be examined by flogging, to find out why they were shouting against him like this.*

This shows the cruelty of the Romans. After Paul had almost been beaten to death but had miraculously been prevented from it (see explanation above) the Romans now wanted not to whip him, but *flog* him, which was much worse and could even lead to the death of a person—only to find out the truth. 
The truth should have been obvious. Paul had already told his story—what more could he say—and they had seen the response of the Jews, that is they were acting as a mob and shouting senseless things. 
Aside from this, even if Paul were not a Roman, it would be cruel to punish a man without even condemning or indicting him. At the least one should know what one is being punished for. 

*25 But when they had stretched him out for the whips, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, “Is it lawful for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?”*

Why did Paul wait until the very last moment to tell the centurion about his Roman citizenship? According to the text—if it is translated correctly—the examiners were already done with stretching him out for the whips and the centurion was there all the time. 
Perhaps Paul did this so that he could say this line at the right time to maximize the impact. If he had not been stretched out and the whips were not visibly present, the tension would not have been built up. 
Imagine a hearing or an interrogation in a room where a person is still being treated nicely and the suspect says the line that Paul said. That would be too early. #biblestudy/questions

*26 When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and said to him, “What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.”*

It is also noticeable that the centurion and the tribune believed Paul when he said this when anyone could have said they were had Roman citizenship. Apparently this was not something one could say lightly. 

*27 So the tribune came and said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” And he said, “Yes.” 28 The tribune answered, “I bought this citizenship for a large sum.” Paul said, “But I am a citizen by birth.” 29 So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately, and the tribune also was ::afraid::, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.*

***Paul Before the Council***
*30 But on the next day, desiring to know the real reason why he was being accused by the Jews, he unbound him and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and he brought Paul down and set him before them.*

The *but* in this sentence seems to indicate that the tribune had a change of heart, meaning that he actually wanted to release him, but because of his desire to hear the real reason, he still did not do so, so he could obtain the reason from the chief priests.
