# Acts 8 (ESV) 
**Saul Ravages the Church**
*1 And Saul approved of his execution.*
*And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.*

Stephen's death apparently was not only the catalyst for Evangelization due to the scattering of Christians, but before that it was the catalyst for a great persecution. After the crowd took Stephen after his #todo/opzoeken/engels rede of betoog, it seems from the text they did not await a verdict or followed any of the procedures—except for executing him outside of the city—but took him directly to stone him. This kind of impulsive behavior, when it is not punished, will spread around like a wildfire and can hardly be contained, if at all. 
Currently, in the United States, after the death of George Floyd by a police officer #tags/historic events#protests started against the police and though these were peaceful at first, a few soon started to become riots—or the riots started simultaneously with the peaceful ones, I do not know the details. The thing is that these riots should have been contained directly or they would spread, which it did, and the crowd easily joined in and the outsiders, though not joining the riots, did not (always) condemn the riots. 

But if God did not contain persecution, because He had others goals for the scattered Christians, namely to spread the Gospel in this way, does God then also has goals with the current riots by the black population? He definitely has, but we do not know what. It could be a counter movement, like Christianity. It could be that these events show the true nature of Left-wing (and some Right-wing) politicians and Left-supporting celebrities and that will cause the people to see the *Black Lives Matter* movement and the Left for what it is: not a movement that actually cares about lives and especially black lives, because people were killed in these riots and stores were plundered, but a party that is too afraid to make any judgment call out of fear of losing votes. Popularity is the only thing they care about. #tags/politics

*2 Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him. 3 But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison.*

Again in verse 3 we find the word "but" which indicates that the verse before it is different from this one. In verse 3 Saul was *ravaging* the church, so we would expect the verse 2 to contain the opposite of ravaging, which is *building up*, but verse 2 "only" tells us that men were burying Stephen and making great lamentation, which is crying and grieving. 
Burying a member of your congregation and lamenting over him, even though you are losing a member, you are still building up the church. How can we build up the church with a common thing like that and how can we build it up when we lose people? 
Lamenting is the showing of true grievance and love for this person. Those who do not lament, perhaps because they did not know the dead one well, can still comfort the survivors, which is an expression of love for them. It is through love and the expression thereof that the church is built up. Everywhere in the New Testament we see that where the disciples love other people, such as the lame and sick, people come to Christ. As mentioned before, it is the Holy Spirit Who works here, not our love per se , but the Holy Spirit filled them after they prayed in *unity* which is characterized by love. Examples of newly converts in the absence of love do not exist. Even if the newly convert only saw a vision of God, like Muslims often do and like Paul did, they can feel and realize God's love for them. 

The second question is how the church can be built up when it loses members. We see this happening all the time in the persecuted Church, that is that congregations in northern and central (west and east) Africa, practically all of East Asia, except for the Westernized countries such as Hong Kong (which has now become a city of China), Taiwan, Singapore and South-Korea, and Thailand as an exception. The number of people in their congregation is not declining per se  when people are being sent to prison, because in prison this person can Evangelize and make even more members. Now these members may join a different congregation, so the congregation would become smaller, but the Church would become bigger. 
How do we explain then when a member dies, before he got the chance to Evangelize? The situation in which one dies are more significant than one thinks. First of all, quite often a person does not die directly, but still has a few last words. By the expression of love through words such as "Forgive them, Father, for they do not know what they are doing" or during the beheading of 21 Egyptians Coptic Christians in Libya in 2015 #tags/historic events# , recorded on video and gone viral over the world—however, not heard of within the secular community—when one of the Christians told another person about Christ and why he wanted to die for him, this person himself came to Christ at that moment. I have read somewhere that the kneeled there as well and offered his life to God.  #todo/opzoeken  verify where it was written

**Philip Proclaims Christ in Samaria**
*4 Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word. 5 Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ. 6 And the crowds with one accord paid attention to what was being said by Philip, when they heard him and saw the signs that he did. 7 For unclean spirits, crying out with a loud voice, came out of many who had them, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. 8 So there was much joy in that city.*

**Simon the Magician Believes**
*9 But there was a man named Simon, who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was somebody great. 10 They all paid attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is the power of God that is called Great.” 11 And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic. 12 But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 13 Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed.*
*14 Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, 15 who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, 16 for he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 17 Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. 18 Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, 19 saying, “Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.” 20 But Peter said to him, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! 21 You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God. 22 Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you. 23 For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.” 24 And Simon answered, “Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.”*
*25 Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.*

**Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch**
*26 Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” This is a desert place. 27 And he rose and went. And there was an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship 28 and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah. 29 And the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over and join this chariot.” 30 So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?”*

Philip did not know what he had to do when he was being sent from Samaria the south of Jerusalem. He had to walk a large distance and walk for days without knowing what to do and why to do this. All he knew, was that the angel told him to do this so apparently God wanted him to do that. 
It was only when he was in the *vicinity* of his goal that the Spirit—and not the angel—told Philip to join the chariot. Only when he was *next* to the chariot within hearing distance, which must have been very nearby when the chariot was making a lot of noise—which horses and carts do—did Philip know that it was an unbeliever who was reading from Isaiah. 
Sometimes we need to forget about ourselves and stop asking questions. Sometimes God is merciful enough to give us a clearer sound, as through an angel, when the distance is further, and sometimes God makes the sound less distinct, as from the Spirit—if I may interpret it that way—from the inside, when we are closer. But we should not stop because we do not know what to do anymore. When we are close enough we will hear the reason why we have to move, which in this case was to save a lost and searching soul. 
This may be very uncomfortable. Philip had to be close to the big horses and cartwheels of the chariot. Being so close to those things, while wearing sandals and while running, can be a scary feeling. One mistake and you could be crushed by the hoofs or the wheels. 
But this is always how it feels. The closer you get to God’s purpose, the scarier it gets. A friend of mine who often evangelizes on the streets told me that even after many successes and experience of evangelizing on the streets, he is still nervous every time, before he picks up the microphone and starts preaching. But as soon as he preaches the words will flow out of his mouth and then wonderful things happen. He has testimonies about drunken people who changed and demon-possessed people who clearly did not want to hear the voice of Jesus. But still, right before the action starts, there is always this tension. 
Another friend of mine in church says he is tensed before every sermon. This is logical. Who would not be tensed if he were to preach from God’s Word, the Holiest book of the Bible, coming from the people inspired by God Himself, Who spoke the Words and redacted the text Himself? Anyone not being tensed would not realize the holiness and size of what he is doing—and anyone not realizing this would not be worthy or preaching it, for the message he preached, would not contain the awe for God’s Word that is needed. Even the famed pianist #tags/famouspeople Vladimir Horowitz was tensed, up to the verge of literally vomiting—and he had done so—even while he was the best pianist of the world—at that time and even still remains so undefeated—eventually ending up in mental or psychiatric hospital due to nervous breakdowns only to largely—but never completely—recover from his tension years later and get back on the stage—and that was for something far less great as preaching the Word!—although it may not have been to him, although being a (secular) Jew. 

*31 And he said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.*

Understanding 


*32 Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this:*
*“Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter*
*and like a lamb before its shearer is silent,*
*so he opens not his mouth.*
*33 In his humiliation justice was denied him.*
*Who can describe his generation?*
*For his life is taken away from the earth.”*
*34 And the eunuch said to Philip, “About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?” 35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus. 36 And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “See, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?” 38 And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. 39 And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing. 40 But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.*
