# Acts 6 (ESV)
**Seven Chosen to Serve**
*1 Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint by the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.*

"Arose against" is kind of a hard measure when the Hebrews, the Christians, I would think, were already voluntarily helping the people and sharing from their own pockets. The Hellenists had no right of receiving part of the daily distribution, be it they or their widows, as they did not even shared their own possessions for it was the Christians who did it. 
The true character of the Hellenists would later come to light when the Hellenists disputed and eventually killed Stephen and also tried to kill Paul in Acts 9. 
The fact that the Christians did not stand up against them, but rather gently thought of a way to better aid the community, was good testimony of their genuine love for people. It is a pity though that the Hellenists were only looking out for their own interests and perhaps that was part of the reason why they did not have access to the temple, aside from the fact they probably did not speak Hebrew and had mixed their religion and culture with the Greek one. 

*2 And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said, “::It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables.:: 3 Therefore, brothers, pick out from among you seven men of ~good repute~, ::full of the Spirit:: and of wisdom, whom we will appoint to this duty. 4 But we will devote ourselves to ::prayer and to the ministry of the word::.” 5 And what they said pleased the whole gathering, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch. 6 These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands on them.*
*7 And the word of God continued to increase, and the number of the ::disciples:: multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith.*

"disciples" is used here, but elsewhere this is "believers". (MacSBNnkjv) cf. 2:41, 47; 4:4; 5:14; 9:31; 12:24; 13:49; 16:5; 19:20).

After praying—in *unison*—the number of disciples multiplied *again*! This is the third time in Acts that we see this happen. It is always through the Holy Spirit that this happens of course, but it seems like the Holy Spirit is working through the harmony of the people, which is practised by praying with each other. 
Why would God use prayer as the standard for unity #todo/opzoeken/engels de lat, the threshold, the measurement stick? Is it not easy to find a few Christian and pray with them? One does not even need the same denominational background in order to pray together, as long as the subjects are not too sensitive.
Indeed praying with others is not a difficult thing. One could pray "with" millions of people, but then one is actually only saying what he wants to say himself. We know that the real prayer is from the Holy Spirit, it is the Holy Spirit Who puts the words in our mouth. #todo/opzoeken waar?  and when the Holy Spirit works through not one person, but multiple, then their prayers will be aligned as well. 
Take for example the speaking in different tongues during Pentecost. The disciples were all saying the same, but only in a different language. 


* Acts 2:1 They prayed and the Holy Spirit came. Filled the entire ::house::. ::Filled:: with the Holy Spirit, ::speak:: in other tongues. 
* Acts 2:42 fellowship and *prayer* and many wonders and signs were being done. Afterwards, people were started to sell their possessions. That in itself is a miracle! ::Awe:: came upon every soul, wonders and signs, sharing. Added to their number, day by day. 
* Acts 4:23 "they lifted their voices *together* to God and" prayed and the ::place:: was shaken, they were ::filled:: with the Holy Spirit and they ::spoke:: with boldness. 
* Acts 6:6 They prayed (plural), the number of disciples multiplied 

the word of God continued to increase -> how can a word increase? 
It is mostly when the Word of God is spread, that the number of believers or disciples increases as well. In the nine references mentioned, there are only two where the Word of God is not mentioned, although we can assume that this must have happened. 
So we see this order: 

1. the disciples pray together
2. the Holy Spirit fills them
3. miracles happen
4. the Word of God is spread
5. people come to Christ

We can understand why the apostles wanted to maintain the important parts in order to fix the problem raised by the Hellenists. Out of the five points only two can be done by people, praying and spreading the Word of God. The other points are only done by the Holy Spirit, while Points 1 and 4 are inspired by the Holy Spirit as well. 
If the apostles had let themselves be led by the need of this world, they would have spent their time on ministering the poor, but then the whole foundation and engine of this process would have been gone. There would be no miracles then, and no people coming to Christ, and therefore no income and no poor people to feed and all would stop, as some churches and ministries have. 

**Stephen Is Seized**
*8 And Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people. 9 Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen. 10 But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.*

If they could not withstand the arguments coming from the wisdom of the Holy Spirit, it means they were not speaking with wisdom. There are two possibilities from then on, either they admit they are wrong or they do not. They chose the latter. There is nothing special about that, as many will do so who do not care about the truth, but only care about being right. But what is surprising is that start thinking of a plan to kill Stephen, simply because they could not win a debate? 
People who cannot win an argument must find another way to be right and that is to silence the other party. The High Priest and his Sadducees did this by inducing fear in the Peter and John, which did not work, because their fear for God was greater, by taking away their freedom, but that also did not work, because their freedom in God was greater. The Hellenists could not silence Stephen with arguments, because Gods wisdom is greater, so now they try to force their victory through lies, but God's truth is greater. Eventually we will see that Stephen, on behalf of God, wins the debate through logical reasoning and deduction, and the Hellenists kill him because they have no other way to silence him. 
In this way they acknowledged their loss of the debate, their weaker positions relative to Christians and their guilt—the same thing Stephen accused them of in Chapter 7, thereby fulfilling the prophecy themselves. 

*11 Then they secretly instigated men who said, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.” 12 And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council, 13 and they set up false witnesses who said, “This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law, 14 for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us.” 15 And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.* 

If lying was not enough, they also had to set up false witnesses and stir up people. They keep accusing him of the same thing as they accused Jesus of: blasphemy and speaking against the Law of Moses and God. Is that not the same thing Muslims are doing to seize Christians? #tags/religion/islam In Islamic countries where Christians are not illegal by default, Muslims need to find a way to entrap Christians and they usually do that by making up the excuse the Christians blaspheme God or His prophet, which in that case not Moses but Muhammad. 
Asia Bibi from Pakistan is one of those people and Open Doors regularly reports and publishes these cases on their website.
