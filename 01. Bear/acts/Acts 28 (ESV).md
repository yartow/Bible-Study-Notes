# Acts 28 (ESV) 
***Paul on Malta***
*1 After we were brought safely through, we then learned that the island was called Malta. 2 The native people showed us ::unusual:: kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold.*

What would constitute **unusual kindness** after a party has been through a storm, gone for weeks with little to no food (27:33) and still needing to swim in the cold sea for the last few hundred meters? On top of that, upon arrival it had begun to rain and it was cold. Normal persons would make a fire, get blankets, water, food and care for the sick for such people. That would be a *usual* kindness. 
Perhaps it was unusual *compared to* the kindness Paul was used to from the Europeans in Greece or the Jews or other Middle-Eastern people he was in contact with. The Romans, for sure, were neither kind nor hospitable to him—but then again, he was a prisoner—and neither were the Jews who set out for his death. On the other hand, Malta, one could say they are like the Spaniards or Italians, who are known all over the world for their hospitality and friendliness. 
Surely this kindness would not be alien to Paul, for he had the Holy Spirit Who is the *source* of kindness and whose kindness Paul undoubtedly had experienced in at least one of the churches he had planted or helped build up in #todo/opzoeken modern-day Turkey. 

*3 When Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand.*

Note that even after these tiresome weeks—not only did he suffer the same fate as the rest, and perhaps even worse(Footnote: As a prisoner he perhaps did not even have a bed or hammock to sleep in, but perhaps had to sleep on the floor)—he also had to encourage the crew and its passengers and keep the hope up, which is very tiresome (see for example Elijah's experience after he went through the ceremony #todo/opzoeken reference contest with Baalite #todo/opzoeken/engels priests where he was not merely physically but also mentally worn out), yet Paul was helped out gathering wood. Of course, a very big fire or multiple fires were needed for 276 people, but then again, there were just as many pairs of hands who could help gathering wood. 

*4 When the native people saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.” 5 He, however, shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm. 6 They were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.*

Many people base their thoughts on what they have learned and what they have seen last. They had learned to judge a person' morality by what happens to a person. In a certain sense, this is Biblical, for God says that the unrighteous shall be repaid for the wrong they have done (Colossians 3:31 #todo/opzoeken reference), however, the Bible also says that Job, who was righteous, suffered for other reasons, as does Jesus say about the people who died in the tower of #todo/opzoeken . 

*7 Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us and ::entertained:: us hospitably for ::three:: days.*

A sign of good hospitality is not only the reception and the provision, that is food and lodging, but also the entertaining. A guest needs to have someone to converse to and to guide him in the customs of this new place he is at. 
This is something I need to repent of. Even though I do quite my best at entertaining people when they come to my city for a few days, where I can show them the "glory" of Rotterdam, if you will, but when people are at my home, I do not feel this urge to let them feel welcome or home. I retreat into my #todo/opzoeken schulp cave and mind my own matters. 

*8 It ::happened:: that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery. And Paul visited him and prayed, and putting his hands on him, healed him. 9 And when this had taken place, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured. 10 They also honored us greatly, and when we were about to sail, they put on board whatever we needed.*

It is not a coincidence that the happenings in v.8 occurred exactly three days after having been received by Publius. The number three indicates God's unity and has a special meaning (see also Steve Cioccolanti's #tags/famouspeople/christian book #tags/books #todo/opzoeken  Encyclopedia of ... ). 
Also, that it happens to be that Publius' father was sick and Paul was there to heal him could not be a coincidence. Rather, it was a sign of God's providence and sovereignty to let the man become sick and be healed by His power, so that many could be cured and perhaps in some way hear of the Gospel and repent of their sin. Most likely at least some of people there spoke Latin or some Italian or Spanish dialect (which Latin-speaking people would possibly be able to comprehend), which Paul would have been able to speak as well, or otherwise Greek. If so, the Gospel would have come across intelligibly. Strangely enough, Luke does not mention any converts here, which seems to indicate that the message did not come across, possibly, though unlikely, because of a language barriere. 
The **us** in v.10 is most likely referring to Luke and Paul(Footnote: See also https://ed5015.tripod.com/BActsWeSections153.html for more information about Luke's presence during Paul's journeys.). The Maltan #todo/opzoeken/engels would have considered Paul a **god**, even though Paul would have pursuaded them that it is the Lord God, the Almighty Yahweh, Who provided Paul with strength to overcome the snake bite and the healing of Publius' father. **They also honored** Luke, who perhaps also aided in the healing. I do not see why the rest of the crew would be honored, unless this was a general honor the Maltan people provided to everyone. However, the context does not seem to indicate this, as the honor rather seems to be connected to the things **they put on board** for them. So they not only provided the things they needed—and possibly for free as well, since they had nothing to trade with because everything had been thrown overboard—but also the labor to put it on board. Consider also that everything was rare in this winter period. Wheat was in great need in the cities and very costly and it was exactly for that reason, i.e. to make money, that these ships underwent the dangerous journey to deliver this. 

They even received a new ship, for their ship's stern was broken, was stuck on a reef and had no anchors anymore (Acts 27:40ff). What generosity! God provides in multiple ways and in this case, he did it through the Maltans, who received nothing from Paul except physical healing. 
How much greater would their generosity be if they had received spiritual healing as well! 

***Paul Arrives at Rome***
*11 After three months we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island, a ship of Alexandria, with the twin gods as a figurehead. 12 Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days. 13 And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a ::south:: wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.*

It is no coincidence that only after one day **a south wind sprang up**. This again shows God's providence and the need to go to Malta first, because God wanted to reach those people. 
God, of course, had several plans running simulatenously during all of these events, as He always has. He wanted to train Paul, convert some of the crew members and reach out to the Maltans, and spread the Gospel to as far as was possible that time. Later on, Christians in Rome would set out even further, but this for now, this was presumably as far as God wanted to go. 

*14 There we found brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome. 15 And the brothers there, when they heard about us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us.*

The fact they **found brothers** is more than a mere coincidence and serves multiple purposes.
Paul perhaps spread the Gospel on the streets, when he had the chance, and this would then attract attention upon which the Word spread. Perhaps this got into the ears of Christian brothers, who then spread the word very fast, for on their next stop, Rome, brothers all the way from **the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns**—which was a few days walking by foot—had come to see Paul. 
In any case, it was not a common thing to see brothers from abroad, especially not imprisoned ones and those who came to plead with the emperor. Imprisonment of Christians was not a rare thing in Rome—Aquila and Priscilla left because of this reason—but it still might have attracted attention. This is perhaps why word got to spread this fast and why the Christian brothers in Puteoli heard about Rome.

What is incredible is that these brothers allowed 276 people (or 76 according to some translations) from this ship to **stay with them for seven days**, among which unbelievers and even those who guarded Paul. It could also be that they guards had such trust in Paul that they let him go on their own, while the rest slept aboard the ship which was being prepared for another trip. #todo/opzoeken how far to Rome from Puteoli? 
Either way, even if it were only Paul and Luke, the brothers showed *hospitality*. Something of which we know the concept in our present day, but which *function* we have forgotten. It is those cultures where hospitality served more than "letting one feel as if he is at home", but actually was one where travelers were aided on their journey and a resting place. Of course this cost something, but when one had to travel himself, he could expect the same kind of aid. 
Presently, we do not need this aid, because we can afford to go to hotels or other places to stay at, and in most cases we can simply drive back the same day or otherwise arrange our stay before our departure. So because we do not need any aid, we have become reluctant to provide it as well. #personal/family/familytime/done/acts Vertel het verhaal hierboven, vertel over oom Michael en andere mensen die mijn ouders hebben ontvangen thuis. Over Ds. Chen en mijn moeder, Sandra's moeder en zij die bij Patricia hebben gewoond. Sandra's derde oom (en nog iemand) die door Sandra's vader is geholpen en zelfs een winkel heeft gekregen. #church/material/sermon 

*On seeing them, Paul thanked God and took ::courage::. 16 And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who guarded him.*

The second reason hospitality is so valuable is because of the **courage** Paul gained upon seeing the brothers. It is not only of much importance, but *crucial* to Christians to keep up the courage as God commanded Joshua (Joshua 1:6). Joshua required this, as did Gideon as well as every other follower of God—and especially leaders—in order to fulfill the commandments and missions God has given.
The brothers might have heard of Paul because of the work he had done throughout Europe, and Paul of course had heard of them through Aquila and Priscilla and perhaps many other Christians who had fled Rome. Paul had even written a letter to them a few months to about a year earlier when he was in Corinth, before his departure to Jerusalem where he was seized and then brought on this "missionary journey", and it is rightly called so. Even though the Satan did not intend this journey to be missionary and wanted to stop Paul from spreading the Gospel even further, God still used it for His purposes to spread the Gospel to even more places and showing more of His miracles and works, among which the biggest work, that of His Son here on Earth. 

***Paul in Rome***
*17 After three days he called together the local leaders of the Jews, and when they had gathered, he said to them, “Brothers, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. 18 When they had examined me, they wished to set me at liberty, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case. 19 But because the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar—though I had no charge to bring against my nation.*

Paul had done "nothing" wrong (within this context, of course, not meaning he was perfect), ever since he converted and went out to preach the Gospel, although one could doubt and judge differently about his discussion with Barnabas (#todo/opzoeken  reference). 
**I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers**. As for this matter concerning his work for the Jews as well as the Gentiles, he had the right theology, always showing love and patience, and showing meekness and gentleness, especially to the Jews, except in some situations. One of these was actually about the fact where Paul claims he has lived his "life before God in all good conscience" (Acts 23:1). His impatience—perhaps—arises where he unknowingly names a High Priest and calls out his hypocritical implementation of the Law, when this officer of the Law does not keep it. So Paul is more aghast of that than of the fact he was struck on his mouth. 
Being treated so harshly, all the while when one has lived such a good life, having given so much to the Jews both in his former and his present life, this must have been really discouraging to Paul.  Nonetheless, he kept on praying for the salvation of the Jews and speaking positive of them (see for example Romans 11:25ff). This is probably what he means when he says: "**though I had no charge to bring against my nation**".

*20 For this reason, therefore, I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am wearing this chain.” 21 And they said to him, “We have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you. 22 But we desire to hear from you what your views are, for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against.”*
*23 When they had appointed a day for him, they came to him at his lodging in greater numbers. From morning till evening he expounded to them, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets. 24 And some were convinced by what he said, but others disbelieved. 25 And disagreeing among themselves, they departed after Paul had made one statement: “The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet:*

It seems like the Jews in Rome were partially objective, since they were not influenced by the Jews from Israel, however, the gossip about Christianity had already taken place and was heard by them. Then, after a whole day of expounding and testifying, some still did not believe. Notice that God did not use any miracles here to lower the threshold for them to believe, perhaps because all their hearts had **grown dull**, even those who *were convinced*, as we see that  **they departed after Paul had made one statement**. Their conviction was merely rational. From the text it does not seem that there was any debate where the Jews used their arguments to #todo/opzoeken/engels overwinnen  defeat? Paul's, most likely because they could not say anything—not because Paul was such a good debater, but because Paul used facts and the Old Testament which not he, but the Holy Spirit knows better and knows how to interpret. 
Since even the convinced people left, it means they were not truly convicted nor had they repented of their sin. 

*26 “‘Go to this people, and say,*
*“You will indeed hear but never understand,*
*and you will indeed see but never perceive.”*
*27 For this people's heart has grown dull,*
*and with their ears they can barely hear,*
*and their eyes they have closed;*
*lest they should see with their eyes*
*and hear with their ears*
*and understand with their heart*
*and turn, and I would heal them.’*

This verse does not say that God *made* **this people's heart [...] dull** or their ears **barely hear**, it said that it has **grown dull**. This happened by the people themself, by the actions of these people themselves. Young people who listen to music that is too loud often get hearing problems and some get tinnitus as well. They have not treated their ears well. Others read books with too little light or watch bright screens in the dark, destroying their eyesight. For these Jews in Rome—and for all other Jews who reject God—the same thing happened to their eyes and ears. 
On the other hand, though, the word **lest** indicates that someone acted with an intention. God acted by letting this happen *so that* they would not understand and so that He would not **heal them**. 
Why, then, would God not let these people understand so that they would repent? Does not God want all people to be saved? #todo/opzoeken reference not one should perish Nogmaals luisteren naar bericht van Jure. 
I cannot think of any other interpretation than that God in His sovereignty willed that these people would not be saved. As mentioned in Romans 9:22-23 some people are vessels *prepared for destruction* and were created *in order to ... for vessels of mercy*. So, in other words, they were made for those vessels will be saved. This is an issue within the Doctrine of Election #biblestudy/theology/predestination/election, which some try to explain away, but there just is no other explanation when taking the Bible as a whole. 

*28 Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen.”*
*30 He lived there two whole years ::at his own expense::, and welcomed all who came to him, 31 proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.*

The spreading of the Gospel is a costly matter, costing not only our time and effort, but also—in Paul's case—his body and his own money, even for being imprisoned! 
On the one hand it is logical that a criminal should pay for his own imprisonment. He caused something in society that cost money, and if society has to pay again for his imprisonment, this would not be fair (except when someone has the death penalty, in which case the government could choose not to execute this, but to bring the person to forced labor, in order to pay back his debt). On the other hand, the imprisonment itself is a way of punishment, which is too costly to ever pay back, except through full-time labor. Putting prisoners in isolation will never lead to a return on the costs made.
In any case, Paul was not a criminal and yet paid from his own expense. What better role-model citizen is there!
