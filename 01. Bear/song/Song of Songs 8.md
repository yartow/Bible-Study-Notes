# Song of Songs 8
#biblestudy/devotionals/Song

*If only you were to me like a brother,*
*who was nursed at my mother’s breasts!*
*Then, if I found you outside,*
*I would kiss you,*
*and no one would despise me.*
*I would lead you*
*and bring you to my mother’s house —*
*she who has taught me.*

She wants to kiss him so much, but cannot do so, probably because Middle-Eastern culture did not allow for those things to happen on the streets. It could be that she is still in the parade and cannot wait to go into the bedroom with him. 
She is, however, speaking of her "mother's house". Perhaps she just means "her" house, like Western people say. In Eastern cultures—I have read from Sarah Lanier's book #tags/books *Foreign to familiar*—people say "our" house because it is their collective possession. In this case her father has most likely already passed away and therefore it is now her "mother's house". 

*I would give you spiced wine to drink,*
*the nectar of my pomegranates.*
*His left arm is under my head*
*and his right arm embraces me.*

It is in her (mother's) house that she could take care of him the way she wants to, by serving him drinks and self-made juice, from pomegranates of her own garden, the latter either coming literally from her vineyard or figuratively and meaning something sexual.
Now too, as in Song of Songs 2, his arm is under her head, meaning they are close to each other, but the difference is that now they are allowed to let it lead up to sex, whereas then they were. Now she is willing, because she has the certainty of marriage whereas then she did not even know him.
It is regretful to say that in this age people still do not have any certainty of their husband staying with them when they get married, or the other way around, they already know the one they are going to have sex with will not be their husband and therefore have sex before marriage. 

*Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you:*
*Do not arouse or awaken love*
*until it so desires.*

I am glad she realizes this. She probably has not given much thought to staying a virgin until marriage, but assumed it because of her culture and everyone who does it in the same way—except for prostitutes. But it is still good to see that a culture lives this way, because it has good results for marriage. 
The Middle-East is rightly afraid of the West, not for its weapons, but for its cultural influence on their children. If the West penetrates the East with its media, it is only a matter of time before religion and chastity will disappear form the East.

***Friends***
*Who is this coming up from the wilderness*
*leaning on her beloved?*

This could be the scene where people in Jerusalem see the new couple arriving. Just like the Shulammite saw a column of smoke from afar, which were Solomon's chariots, now the people of Jerusalem see this as well, but they also see a person next to Solomon. 
In Western weddings something like this occurs as well, in the beginning. First we see the groom coming in. Then we see the bride coming in, from afar, leaning on, not her beloved, but her father. 

***She***
*Under the apple tree I roused you;*
*there your mother conceived you,*
*there she who was in labor gave you birth.*

It would be strange to interpret this as being said by the Shulammite. If she had said this indeed, then what would *rouse* mean here? Was Solomon's love aroused? Only if she was his first love, but she was not a queen and neither his first queen mentioned in 1 Kings. 
And what would his mother have to do with anything? 
If we interpret this as coming from Solomon's mouth, then this gets an extra meaning, but it still does not solve every question. The rousing could then stand literally for waking her up from her nightmare in Song of Songs 3. Figuratively, it could stand for arousing her love, perhaps the first time they met, under the apple tree. Still, it is unclear what the "mother" has to do with anything. 
Also, it is unclear why the "mother" would both conceive and give labor at the same place.

*Place me like a seal over your heart,*
*like a seal on your arm;*

I think we can assume from this part on that it is the woman speaking. 
The seal is meant to close something. She is asking that Solomon's heart must now be closed for other women. Nothing must enter it—except she of course. 
I would find a strange translation, because a seal is meant to be opened by the right person. If she is the still, then who is the one to *break* the seal—that is she—and open the message underneath?

*for love is as strong as death,*
*its jealousy unyielding as the grave.*

A very famous part of the Bible, verses 6 and 7 both, especially of the Old Testament, which I unfortunately did not know until now. 
Love, though meek as it is, giving an sacrificing of the one who loves, is very strong. A mother who loves her child will give everything to her child and become very vulnerable in the process. Right after giving birth she is vulnerable to infections and 50 percent of all women died after child-birth. 
So strong is love that she is willing to die for it and that people still love another, even when the other has already been dead for years. 
Related to this love is jealousy. For one loves what is theirs or what they wants to have. A man who is not married to a woman, cannot be jealous of this woman's spouse, for she is not his, but her spouse's. In this case we are talking about envy, not jealousy. But jealousy is applied when something is rightfully yours, but is now taken by another. When will a man stop being jealous when his wife has been taken by another? Will he give up on her after some time? No, he will never, if he truly loves her. Here too, we would die to get her back.

*It burns like blazing fire,*
*like a mighty flame.*

Jealousy burns like fire and destroys things around them as well. A person so jealous is able to kill the man who took his wife. Perhaps not righteously so, because we are not allowed to kill, but God, Who is allowed to do anything, will kill and has already done so many times, when *His* people were worshipping other gods and when other peoples abducted His people.

*Many waters cannot quench love;*
*rivers cannot sweep it away.*

Love cannot be destroyed, not by anything. One can say, then how does one stop loving another, for that has really occurred in life. Yes, some people stop loving the other, when they have not seen the other person after a long time. Another situation is that a person is violent or a drunkard, and his spouse chooses to separate from him and leave him, never to return. 
The answer here is that one *chooses* not to love another. One not only can, but must choose to love the other. People say they *fall* in love, but actually they are *permitting* it—or better said, choosing to permit it—to enter their life. One always has the choice to allow for love in their or to focus on other tasks and purposes in life.
When people cheat on another, they choose to "love" another person and in doing so

*If one were to give*
*all the wealth of one’s house for love,*
*it would be utterly scorned.*

I do not know what is meant by *it* here. But whether it refers to the wealth or to the *one*, in both cases it would be scorned. A woman would despise the money and despise the person as well, for thinking that she can be bought with money. 

***Friends***
*We have a little sister,*
*and her breasts are not yet grown.*
*What shall we do for our sister*
*on the day she is spoken for?*

Of course David Pawson's interpretation about another little sister might be wrong. There might be no other little sister except for the protagonist in this song. On the other hand, if that is the case, then how could Solomon marry such as young woman of, say, 13 to 15 years old, in the beginning of puberty, "when her breasts are not yet grown"? Or put otherwise, how could the brothers allow her to marry someone?
Another question is what is meant by the day "she is spoken for". Is it the day she will marry someone, or that someone comes to ask for her hand, if Solomon ever did such as thing? 

*If she is a wall,*
*we will build towers of silver on her.*
*If she is a door,*
*we will enclose her with panels of cedar.*

The analogy of a wall and door beautifully described. Although I despise the act of her brothers to force her to work on their vineyards, they still take up their brotherly responsibility of protecting her chastity and thereby her purity for God. 
A wall is a pure person, if she is such a person, there will be treasures. The brothers could have meant this when they were speaking of silver. Are these real treasures and are these meant for her? That is, does that mean that the brothers have worked so hard to give her a wedding gift, if she truly has kept her chastity? That seems contradictory with the brothers' other acts of using her for her own good. 
Rather yet, as soon as they realize that her new lover is Solomon, they will demand an even greater wedding gift. 

A door is a sexually immoral person, if that is the case, the brothers will enclose this door to not let others in. Indeed, if a person is sexually immoral, closing her up in her house will not help her spiritual immorality, but at least it will help her physical one. 

***She***
*I am a wall,*
*and my breasts are like towers.*
*Thus I have become in his eyes*
*like one bringing contentment.*

She is saying that she is pure, even if she is not a virgin anymore, she was until marriage. As for her breasts, perhaps she means by towers that her breasts are even more unreachable just like towers are more impenetrable than a wall. This is the reason she thinks why she can bring contentment to her lover. 
Of course this is not all that is needed to keep the other content, not everyone who has purposely stayed pure until marriage will have a good marriage. There is more needed to maintain a marriage.

*Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon;*
*he let out his vineyard to tenants.*
*Each was to bring for its fruit*
*a thousand shekels of silver.*
*But my own vineyard is mine to give;*
*the thousand shekels are for you, Solomon,*
*and two hundred are for those who tend its fruit.*

Her figurative vineyard is her sexuality, which she can give to anyone she desires, though in practice this had to be approved by her brothers or parents. She decides to give it to Solomon. 

***He***
*You who dwell in the gardens*
*with friends in attendance,*
*let me hear your voice!*

He is now calling for her and probably he is in the garden already. If this is the act of making love than "let me hear you voice" could mean he wants her to get to the point of orgasm and shout it out.
Her "friends" are in this case irrelevant as this would not be a public act. But perhaps Solomon wants to cover up the song by mixing two story lines. In the story line where he is looking for her, he is literally asking where she is, because he cannot find her. She is with her friends, probably hiding, perhaps as a game before the wedding, just like Chinese people still do before the groom gets to see the bride. This why she needs to call, to give him a hint. 

***She***
*Come away, my beloved,*
*and be like a gazelle*
*or like a young stag*
*on the spice-laden mountains.*

This is in the act of intercourse the call for him to come, or in other words, to ejaculate. She is asking him to be manly like a gazelle stands on top of the mountains, like Simba or his father did in *the Lion King* and Bambi does in the eponymous Disney® animation. 
In other words, she wants an erected version of his manhood inside of her.
