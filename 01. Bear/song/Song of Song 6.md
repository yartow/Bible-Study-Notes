# Song of Song 6

***Friends***
*Where has your beloved gone,*
*most beautiful of women?*
*Which way did your beloved turn,*
*that we may look for him with you?*

***She***
*My beloved has gone down to his garden,*
*to the beds of spices,*
*to browse in the gardens*
*and to gather lilies.*
*I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine;*
*he browses among the lilies.*

Now it seems like she suddenly knows where he is, while just a while ago she was asking her friends where he went. 
Again, I am not sure of the meaning of "browsing among the lilies". Though she was deemed a lily, one of the most beautiful flowers in Israel, but growing in the shadows, mostly overlooked and trampled upon,
this could mean he is browsing for more lilies like her, to marry? 

I am not sure whether she is still dreaming or if she is still waiting for Solomon to come. It could be that she is waiting but has received a letter confirming his arrival. 

***He***
*You are as beautiful as Tirzah, my darling,*
*as lovely as Jerusalem,*
*as majestic as troops with banners.*

Comparing a woman to the city of Tirzah is a major compliment, especially when one is compared to the loveliness of Jerusalem as well. A city consists of so many facets, of walls, outskirts and the inner city. Jerusalem's walls are magnificent, made of its own beautiful limestone, unlike what was shown in the movie *Kingdom of Heaven*.
Right now, its army is even more magnificent than then. Of course, now it is largely based on weapons, while then, when they won, it was because of faith in and obedience to God. 

*Turn your eyes from me;*
*they overwhelm me.*
*Your hair is like a flock of goats*
*descending from Gilead.*

Goat hair is grey, sometimes white, but mostly, at least not in the Netherlands, black or fully dark brown. Why would he compare her hair with goats? Even if goats are brown-haired in Israel, I still do not understand because goat hairs are not particularly soft or long, neither are goats friendly and patient, which might interfere with the association. 

*Your teeth are like a flock of sheep*
*coming up from the washing.*
*Each has its twin,*
*not one of them is missing.*

This part and the next are repeated from Chapter 4, but perhaps it is a confirmation that he still loves her and still finds her attractive. She especially needed to hear this because of her uncertainties. 
On the other hand, a song usually has a refrain, to emphasize the contents of it. 

*Your temples behind your veil*
*are like the halves of a pomegranate.*

I have never noticed the temples of a woman, would there be anything not attractive about them, if they were not round or deep enough for example?
And why does he mention a pomegranate? It is not perfectly round or of any other shape and the inside of it looks rather scary.

*Sixty queens there may be,*
*and eighty concubines,*
*and virgins beyond number;*

This is the part that can be interpreted as Solomon being married already and having an already large royal harem.

*but my dove, my perfect one, is unique,*
*the only daughter of her mother,*
*the favorite of the one who bore her.*
*The young women saw her and called her blessed;*
*the queens and concubines praised her.*

David Pawson explained how this book, *Song of Songs*, was written especially for her, just like every queen had her own song. But only hers was kept in the canon, or preserved in history, because only this one is the one whom God wanted Solomon to marry. 
She is probably unique in that she is not of royal heritage and that she was not prepared, like Esther was, before meeting the king. Also, she is a Jew, unlike many of the other queens, who were heathens and pagans. 
I still need to find out why Pawson says she has a little sister. Is that the sister whose "breasts have not formed yet", in a further chapter? 

***Friends***
*Who is this that appears like the dawn,*
*fair as the moon, bright as the sun,*
*majestic as the stars in procession?*

The *Friends*-part does not always seem to be the same people speaking. It could be her friends, or the women of Jerusalem or all of Israel. If it is open for that interpretation, this most likely would be said by the Israelites, as Solomon is bringing her into his carriage and into the city of Jerusalem.

***He***
*I went down to the grove of nut trees*
*to look at the new growth in the valley,*
*to see if the vines had budded*
*or the pomegranates were in bloom.*
*Before I realized it,*
*my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people.*

When not interpreted literally, this could mean he went back to the country, to see if this Shunammite—also spelled *Shunamite* and *Shulammite*—had matured and he did not expect to take her with him so suddenly. It was because of his desire—which in Solomon's case often rules over his wisdom—that he took her with him. 
But if this is true, then there was no promise of returning back, especially not after a fixed time, and the girl was right to have these nightmares of uncertainty.
Another interpretation is that he went to the country for agricultural reasons and when he thought of her, or saw her there, he decided to bring her to the city. 

***Friends***
*Come back, come back, O Shulammite;*
*come back, come back, that we may gaze on you!*

***He***
*Why would you gaze on the Shulammite*
*as on the dance of Mahanaim?*

These two verses seem as if there is a parade, either in the country of in the city, but the Shunamite seems to be veiled or passing by fairly quickly or seen only from a distance. Either way, the people want to have a look at their new queen. Perhaps they have seen her closely, but because she is of such a beauty, they want to see her better. 
Solomon is right here in saying that they do not have to look at her this carefully. This right is reserved for him alone. 
Likewise, tabloids should not post pictures of other women, whether married or single, let alone royal women, like Queen Maxima of the Netherlands and Princess Kate Middleton.
