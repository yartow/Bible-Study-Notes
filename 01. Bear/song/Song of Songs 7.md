***He***
*How beautiful your sandaled feet,*
*O prince’s daughter!*

Almost every part of the body is described here and praised by him. I would find it strange for an audience to say such things. Of course, in tabloids certain body parts are highlighted as well. Lily Collins is famous for her eyebrows and the daughter of Mick Jagger for the gap between her front teeth. But in this context and in this culture, I do not think anyone in the audience of a parade would shout the things on the streets. 

*Your graceful legs are like jewels,*
*the work of an artist’s hands.*

Even in that age female body parts were adored. However,  it is still a question whether they had the same vision of the perfect woman. Ancient Greek statues often portray people in perfect proportions, although in Renaissance works, which are more realistic, the male Greek heroes and gods portrayal has not changed in our age according to the definition of beauty, while that of women has become a lot more slim. 
Keeping that in mind, I am not sure if Solomon had the same kind of woman in mind or a rather fat one.

*Your navel is a rounded goblet*
*that never lacks blended wine.*

Even her navel is beautiful, which would seem like he has already seen these parts of her. Are they married yet? I do not know, as I do not know whether these processions like the parade occur before or after the official marriage ceremony. 

*Your waist is a mound of wheat*
*encircled by lilies.*
*Your breasts are like two fawns,*
*like twin fawns of a gazelle.*
*Your neck is like an ivory tower.*
*Your eyes are the pools of Heshbon*
*by the gate of Bath Rabbim.*
*Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon*

Unfortunate for many woman, a large part of beauty cannot be obtained by efforts of the person herself. The waist, perhaps, and the graceful legs, in part, but the size of breasts, the symmetry, the neck, eyes, eye color and nose are all genetically determined. 
Beauty is reserved for the few—although this small percentage still amounts to many in absolute figures, when I look around these days.
Most of these attributes are ones that Chinese people for example do not have. Eyes with blue irises are impossible for people of pure Asian descent. The same goes for high and sharp noses and sizable breasts. But the neck and the waist, on the other hand, is an attribute of Asians. 

*looking toward Damascus.*
*Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel.*
*Your hair is like royal tapestry;*
*the king is held captive by its tresses.*
*How beautiful you are and how pleasing,*
*my love, with your delights!*
*Your stature is like that of the palm,*
*and your breasts like clusters of fruit.*
*I said, “I will climb the palm tree;*
*I will take hold of its fruit.”*
*May your breasts be like clusters of grapes on the vine,*
*the fragrance of your breath like apples,*
*and your mouth like the best wine.*

It is important to notice that in Song of Songs 5:3, even though that was a dream, though I could have been a memory as well, as these often occur in dreams, Solomon says something like "I have taken off my robe, must I put it on again", or in other words, *I have gone so far, must I stop now*? This probably indicates that Solomon wanted to have sex with her, but was withheld because they were not married yet. 

***She***
*May the wine go straight to my beloved,*
*flowing gently over lips and teeth.*

The wine is her mouth and she kisses him in this passage. 

*I belong to my beloved,*
*and his desire is for me.*

Her body now is his, on the condition that his desire is only for her. This is not true in reality though. Even if this was Solomon's first wife, he would have many more after her.

*Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside,*
*let us spend the night in the villages.*
*Let us go early to the vineyards*
*to see if the vines have budded,*
*if their blossoms have opened,*
*and if the pomegranates are in bloom —*
*there I will give you my love.*

She leads him into her garden to let him see if her fruits—or in other words, she herself—have come to fruition. This could be a reference to her showing him parts of her body, of which I can only imagine one to bear fruit, her genitals, but there could be many more, as Solomon has already described many sensual yet non-sexual parts, such as legs and temples. I have heard men tell of the nape of the neck and the hollow space in the part of the back as the most sensual parts of women. To each his own, I say. 

*The mandrakes send out their fragrance,*
*and at our door is every delicacy,*
*both new and old,*
*that I have stored up for you, my beloved.*

The mandrakes, at least in the time of Jacob, had superstitious powers of fertility. The next line explains how she has stored up all of her love and hopes for him, for this moment, on the last day of being a virgin.
