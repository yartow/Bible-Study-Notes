# Song of Songs 2

***She***
*My beloved is mine and I am his;*
*he browses among the lilies.*
*Until the day breaks*
*and the shadows flee,*
*turn, my beloved,*
*and be like a gazelle*
*or like a young stag*
*on the rugged hills.*

Still, I am not sure if I interpret this correctly. The lilies are supposed to be her. They are the most beautiful flower, but very small to see and growing only in the shadows. Solomon is her beloved, and only hers, she thinks, although later on she will discover in Chapter 6 that he already has 60 queens. Again, that is an interpretation as well. 
In the same line *he browses among the lilies* must mean that Solomon is looking for something in the rural country, where the girls are of pure heart. Not smothered by city behavior.
At a certain time he will have to go, she knows, when "day breaks", and he needs to get back to the hard city, or the "rugged hills". Indeed, Zion is a lot more rugged than the pastures and hills of Hermon.

Still, I do not know when she wrote this. Solomon wrote this song of course, but did he intend to write it as chapters in which she would discover things chronologically?
