*All night long on my bed*
*I looked for the one my heart loves;*
*I looked for him but did not find him.*
*I will get up now and go about the city,*
*through its streets and squares;*
*I will search for the one my heart loves.*
*So I looked for him but did not find him.*

This part is about her nightmares, that she has when he leaves her. Supposedly he has already proposed to her, which would have taken place in Chapter 2, but I do not see it there. She is scared, because she is afraid he will not come back. She is afraid she is nothing more than a summer fling. 
I am not sure if summer flings existed in that time of chastity, and if they did, I do not know if she knew about it, growing up in the country. If she knew about it, I do not know why she would be afraid of that, unless she had experienced it before.   
I have had the experience of a summer love before. It is as if it is easier to fall in love then, partly because the season and the weather is right, perhaps because there is no school leading to no time limits. But it is not right to fall in love under romantic circumstances. One must know one loves for the right reasons. 
The girl I fell in love with, however, was smart enough to not start a relationship, most probably because of the difference in culture and the long distance between us. That, and a probable misunderstanding of money I gave her, which she mistook as money for her services, though I later explained to her that I gave it to her as a gift, for she was in more dire circumstances than others.

*The watchmen found me*
*as they made their rounds in the city.*
*“Have you seen the one my heart loves?”*
*Scarcely had I passed them*
*when I found the one my heart loves.*
*I held him and would not let him go*
*till I had brought him to my mother’s house,*
*to the room of the one who conceived me.*

Only in her mother's house she was willing to let him go. Perhaps this means that only after a man has met the parents (as her father has presumably passed away, since it says "mother's house"), she is more certain that he is serious about the relationship. Perhaps this is because the mother now know his family name and region and a man does not want to spoil his reputation. 

*Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you*
*by the gazelles and by the does of the field:*
*Do not arouse or awaken love*
*until it so desires.*

The girl is smart by asking her friends to be accountable to her and that she may be accountable to them as well. 
Her feelings for him must be tamed, at least until after the wedding. 
She must not think about anything sexually, and not even about how he loves her or their future, until she is certain of his love for her. This is an advice for all other women (in Jerusalem).

*Who is this coming up from the wilderness*
*like a column of smoke,*
*perfumed with myrrh and incense*
*made from all the spices of the merchant?*
*Look! It is Solomon’s carriage,*
*escorted by sixty warriors,*
*the noblest of Israel,*
*all of them wearing the sword,*
*all experienced in battle,*
*each with his sword at his side,*
*prepared for the terrors of the night.*
*King Solomon made for himself the carriage;*
*he made it of wood from Lebanon.*
*Its posts he made of silver,*
*its base of gold.*
*Its seat was upholstered with purple,*
*its interior inlaid with love.*
*Daughters of Jerusalem, come out,*
*and look, you daughters of Zion.*
*Look on King Solomon wearing a crown,*
*the crown with which his mother crowned him*
*on the day of his wedding,*
*the day his heart rejoiced.*

This is the part where Solomon arrives, now not dressed as a shepherd, but as a king.
