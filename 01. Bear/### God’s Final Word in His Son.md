# ### God’s Final Word in His Son

1God, having spoken long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways, 2in these last days spoke to us in *His* Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds, 3who is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power; who, having accomplished cleansing for sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, 4having become so much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.
5For to which of the angels did He ever say,
“You are My Son,
Today I have begotten You”?
And again,
“I will be a Father to Him
And He shall be a Son to Me”?
6And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says,
“And let all the angels of God worship Him.”
7And of the angels He says,
“Who makes His angels winds,
And His ministers flaming fire.”
8But of the Son *He says*,
“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,
And the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.
9“You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;
Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You
With the oil of gladness above Your companions.”
10And,
“You, Lord, in the beginning founded the earth,
And the heavens are the works of Your hands;
11They will perish, but You remain;
And they all will wear out like a garment,
12And like a mantle You will roll them up;
Like a garment they will also be changed.
But You are the same,
And Your years will not come to an end.”
13But to which of the angels has He ever said,
“Sit at My right hand,
Until I put Your enemies
As a footstool for Your feet”?
14Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?
