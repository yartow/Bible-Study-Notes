# 2 Timothy 1 (ESV)

*15 You are aware that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.*

Every missionary in Asia (that is probably not Greece, but Turkey. I do not know of any missionaries there, for Paul's travels and the mentioned people in Acts only concern Greece) turned away. This could not be every *Christian*, for there many Christians he still commends. #todo/nogaftemaken  

*16 May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains, 17 but when he arrived in Rome he searched for me earnestly and found me— 18 may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day!—and you well know all the service he rendered at Ephesus.*

Out of nothing he mentions Onesiphorus. Good deeds are not overcome and Paulus mentions him, while Timothy perhaps not even knows him.
