# 2 Timothy 2 (ESV)
**A Good Soldier of Christ Jesus**
*1 You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus, 2 and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also. 3 Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 4 No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him. 5 An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. 6 It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops. 7 Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.*

In Dutch there is a "but" instead of a "for". 
Perhaps this has to do with the verse: "Zonder Mij kunt ge niets doen". #todo/opzoeken   

*8 Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel, 9 for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound! 10 Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 11 The saying is trustworthy, for:*

#todo/nogaftemaken  #composed/bible/2timothy There should be no "for" here. 
> and the *following* saying is trustworthy and confirms this:   

*If we have died with him, we will also live with him;*
*12 if we endure, we will also reign with him;*
*if we deny him, he also will deny us;*
*13 if we are faithless, he remains faithfulâ€”*
*for he cannot deny himself.*

How can we say this saying is trustworthy if no one has demonstrably lived or reigned with him yet?
