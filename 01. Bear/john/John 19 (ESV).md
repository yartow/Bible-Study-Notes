# John 19 (ESV)
***Jesus Delivered to Be Crucified***
*1 Then Pilate took Jesus and flogged him. 2 And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple robe. 3 They came up to him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and struck him with their hands.*

It is strange to see why the soldiers would spend time on mocking Jesus while leaving the other crucified men alone, although that is merely my presupposition as nothing is written about this in the Bible. It could be that they mocked every prisoner and treated them with the same kind of cruelty. 

*4 Pilate went out again and said to them, “See, I am bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no guilt in him.”*

The hypocrisy of Pilate is clearly visible in that he allowed Jesus to be flogged, and needlessly to be scorned, mocked and abused with the crown of thorns, the robe and to be struck and then say that he finds no guilt in Him. 

*5 So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, “Behold the man!” 6 When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, “Crucify him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him.”*

The chief priests' heart had become so hardened that even after seeing a man, whether innocent or not, flogged and scorned to this level, they had no pity or mercy for him. This has always been the Israelites' worst sin, namely that they had no mercy for their own people. 
#todo/opzoeken Somewhere in Micah? 
The first response of the chief priests and officers when they saw Jesus was not shock and awe of the cruelty done upon this innocent man—and they *knew* He was innocent and had done much good for the people. They were blinded by their own pride and jealousy and all they thought of was the death of this man. So much so that they did not even think of what was written about Jesus in the Old Testament and unknowingly fulfilled the prophecies.

*7 The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has made himself the Son of God.” 8 When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid. 9 He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer. 10 So Pilate said to him, “You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?” 11 Jesus answered him, “You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. ::Therefore:: he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin.”*

Why is there a "therefore" written here? What is the relation between the authority given to Pilate by God and the chief priests who delivered Jesus over to Pilate? Jesus was delivered to Pilate, He was arrested on Pilate's authority. Jesus was *handed* over to him, so that in itself was not Pilate's fault, but rather the Jews who handed over Jesus, they have the greater sin. 
Another interpretation is that the chief priests' authority has also been given them from above, but they abused it for their own good. For that reason as well they have a greater sin. 
A third interpretation is that at least Pilate had received the authority to execute someone. The Jews had not received this authority from God. I am not sure whether the temple police or the chief priests were allowed to arrest people, flog them and execute them as described in the Law, such as in Leviticus, but they most certainly did not have the authority to arrest Jesus. So here to they were overstepping their boundaries and exercising an arrest and hearing outside of their authority, which is a greater sin than flogging someone (even an innocent one) within one's authority. 

*12 From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.” 13 So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, and in Aramaic Gabbatha. 14 Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, “Behold your King!” 15 They cried out, “Away with him, away with him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar.” 16 So he delivered him over to them to be crucified.*

Perhaps Pilate lured them by asking them to crucify their king. He already knew their answer would be "he is not our king", but what he perhaps had not expected was that they said instead: "We have no king but Caesar", with which they judged (Footnote: In John 3:17 the same verb for *judge* is used in Greek *κρίνω*, but translated as *condemned* both in the ESV and KJV. See also https://www.evernote.com/l/AEtgt22PcHhKL7MUQpbLWxzgSSBO2VlHXyQ.) themselves (cf. John 12:47). 

***The Crucifixion***
*So they took Jesus, 17 and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha. 18 There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. 19 Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.” 20 Many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek. 21 So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘This man said, I am King of the Jews.’” 22 Pilate answered, “What I have written I have written.”*

Jesus had never confirmed that He was the king of the Jews and Pilate had never answered where he got this phrase from. Perhaps he had heard it from the Jews, who had quoted Jesus as in verse 21, but even after Jesus had said that the Jews were not of His kingdom—for His kingdom was not of this world and that those of His kingdom would fight for Him—and after the Jews correct Pilate's writing, Pilate still refused to change the writing. 
It is worthy to note that the Jews said that Jesus said He was the king of the Jews, while this quote is nowhere found in any Gospel. 
There is the possibility that Pilate did not want to spend too much time on this issue, as he had been busy with this affair since the early morning and he did not want to send out another decree to correct the placard or tablet, which would have taken much time for the carving in the wood—assuming it was not painted on the board—had to be done over in three languages. This too, would have delayed Jesus' crucifixion—although they could have crucified Him first and then later on swith the boards—and perhaps Pilate did not want Jesus to suffer any longer and let all of this be over as quickly as possible.
See also the notes in *MacSBNnkjv* for an additional interpretation of Pilate's motivation of his text on Jesus' placard. 

*23 When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom, 24 so they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.” This was to fulfill the Scripture which says,*
> *“They divided my garments among them,*  
> *and for my clothing they cast lots.”*  
*So the soldiers did these things,* 

I would not expect Jesus to wear expensive clothes, and that His garments would not have been worth much. On the other hand, Jesus could have been given these clothes by supporters, just as those who donated money to Him for His ministry. 
However, it also proves the soldiers' greediness—as well as their cruelty—for they did not even want a full piece of His clothing, but were willing to tear his clothes apart. Why would anyone want a piece of for example a shirt, such as a sleeve? 
Their cruelty was shown in the fact that these garments were the only thing Jesus wore and they stripped Him naked of it. Now every prisoner hung naked on cross, by law, and the Roman soldiers were commanded to strip the prisoners of their clothes, but the fact that they kept these clothes to themselves, while Jesus' friends and family, including His own mother, were weeping for Him. 
At normal funerals the survivors would at least be able to keep the possessions of the deceased ones. I do not know how this works with the executions and whether they lose the right to all of their possessions. #todo/opzoeken but still it seems harsh that even the garments could not be kept. 

*25 but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of ::Clopas::, and Mary Magdalene. 26 When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” 27 Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.*

Is there a reason why Jesus called His mother "woman" here, just like He did at the wedding event in Kana? In Kana this was because at that time He had to show His authority that no one, not even His own biological mother, could tell the Son of God what to do. Perhaps here Jesus wanted to show Mary that this command to accept John as her son was from God Himself. 
So there were four known Marys in total, including Mary, the sister of Lazarus. 

***The Death of Jesus***
*28 After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), “I thirst.”*

Jesus did not fulfill Scripture by the words "I thirst", although Psalm 22:15 alludes to it, but by Psalm 69:21
> *They gave me poison for food,*  
> *and for my thirst they gave me sour wine to drink.*  
The irony about this part is that even though Jesus was working towards His death in verse 30 in order to *finish* the work, the wine here prolonged His life (according to *MacSBNnkjv*). A little bit of fluid would not keep a person much longer alive and in the end Jesus died before the Sabbath started anyway, but considering the amount of fluid that He lost by all the blood He lost due to the flagellation and sweating by carrying the cross, and hanging on the cross without any protection from the sun by His clothes, any amount of fluid would have been necessary for His body to remain alive. 
However, we do see in verse 30 that it seems as if He died directly after having drunk the wine. 

*29 A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth. 30 When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, “It is finished,” and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.*

#todo/opzoeken did He died directly after drinking, or were there a few lines He said in between or was there perhaps even an hour between the two events? 

No mention of His Father leaving Him is mentioned here. 
John perhaps did this on purpose, because He thought it most relevant to have this final fulfillment of Scripture right before His death, to emphasize that in His, up until the very moment of His last breath, Jesus fulfilled Scripture. 
On the other hand, there is also the question of drinking of wine, for Jesus had said that He would not drink of the fruit of the grape anymore until the day He went to heaven. To interpret this literally would mean that He could drink on the day of the Last Supper and on the next day. This phrase would not have meaning anymore then. See http://bibleq.net/answer/3301/ for a good explanation of this question.  

***Jesus' Side Is Pierced***
*31 Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.*

It is still unknown what the day of Preparation exactly meant, as it could have different meanings, but it is certain that the day after the crucifixion was a high day or a High Sabbath, which is an extra Sabbath, different from the regular weekly Sabbath, due to the Pesach feast. However, it could also be that the High Sabbath fell on the weekly Sabbath. See notes on #todo/nogaftemaken plaats hier link van onderzoek naar dit onderwerp for more information about this subject. 

*32 So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him. 33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.*

There is something poetic in that the others' legs were broken first and that Jesus was last. Also the fact that there were three persons crucified could possibly symbolize something. There were at least two to show the contrast, not between sinner and non-sinners—for these do no exist—but between sinners who repent and those who do not repent and mock Jesus. Yes, there are no sinners who do not repent and who do not mock Jesus, or in other words every sinner who does not repent is mocking Jesus, even if he does not intend this. By not repenting—even if we are not like the criminal who mocked Jesus by telling Him to save Himself (Footnote: Note that both criminals were already crucified and possibly flogged as well and still taunted Jesus while suffering in agony himself and knowing that he would die soon, but such is the heart of the unrighteous ones (although one repented later on, not only for the sins in his life, but also for mocking Jesus personally.).)—we still mock Him by leaving the gift described in Romans 3:24 aside that He gave us, trampling on it, as if it was something cheap He made. #todo make reference from other Gospel narratives about this event to here.
**Example.** I remember when I had written a friendly letter to my then-girlfriend's mother, as a way of respect. After a while she wrote me a letter back, but by that time my girlfriend and I had already separated. So after I received the letter, I did not open it but put it aside, as it had no priority for me—the girl as well as the mother had no part in my life anymore and I would never see or speak with her anyway as she lived in a place in China where I would possibly never go to. 
The girl, however, told me a few weeks after the letter had arrived, that her mother told her that I was being very unrespectful by not even reading the letter that she worked on. I was shocked to hear that and I truly regret it, because she put effort and love in writing that letter. I was not an e-mail written in fifteen minutes, but a hand-written letter with well-considered words. 
What Jesus has given us is worth unimaginably more and even though some could say they did not trample on the gift, but merely put it aside, the hurt would be the same to Jesus because of the different magnitude of His sacrifice. 
Let us take a look at the example of two persons receiving a gift. The first person has received a nicely packed small gift, which is not too expensive and the giver has not put too much effort in it. Upon receiving it, however, she smashes the gift, breaking the contents of it, and then throws it in the trash bin. 
The second person's story is as follows. A person nearly dies due to his travel through the jungle hell, being bitten by spiders, attacked by wild animals, having sleepless nights, getting sick from tropical diseases, and all this to find medicine for his dying friend. Then when he finally comes back and presents this medicine to his friend, his friend "respectfully" rejects the gift, saying that it is not needed for whatever reason. He is respectful in words, he does not smash it, the contents are still whole and can still be used for another person. 
Which giver would feel more humiliated and unrespectfully treated? It is the second one. The giver's feelings are not mainly dependent on the way the receiver accepts the gift, but on how big the sacrifice has been to obtain this gift. #church/material

*34 But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. 35 He who saw it has borne witness—his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth—that you also may believe. 36 For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: “Not one of his bones will be broken.” 37 And again another Scripture says, “They will look on him whom they have pierced.”*

Quoted from Zecheriah 12:10. 

This is the third time in this chapter where it is written that something is done so that Scripture might be fulfilled. How should one interpret this claim? Was Jesus perhaps not thirsty at all in v.28 but He still asked for something to drink only to fulfill Scripture? If that was the case, then how should we interpet verses 24 and 36, where the soldiers did not know about the fulfillment of Scripture and unknowingly fulfilled it? The correct interpretation should be that Scripture is written according to God's will and everything will happen according to God's will, whether people are for or against God. 
Jesus could not thirst by Himself, for one is either thirsty or he is not. So when Jesus was thirsty, He knew He was under the will of God, knowing that God controlled even His thirst to fulfill Scripture, i.e. His will. 
If Jesus had not been thirsty and if He had said: "I thirst", then He would have been lying. Jesus of course could have made Himself thirsty and then say it, but that would be illogical. 

***Jesus Is Buried***
*38 After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission.*

Joseph of Arimethea was a rich person, as the prophecy in Psalms #todo/opzoeken  said that Jesus would be buried in the grave of the rich (also in Matthew 27:57), and powerful as well (as a member of the Sanhedrin, see Mark 15:43) as he even had the right to speak with Pilate. I presume that Jesus' family members wanted to have His body as well but that they did not have any access to the Roman authority, in this case, Pilate. Fortunately, although we know God planned it this way, at least two powerful men among the Jews had converted and God had softenend Pilate's heart as well in order to allow the body to be taken. 

*So he came and took away his body. 39 Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight.*

Note that these two ingredients were meant to stifle the smell of putrefaction (see notes in *MacSBNnkjv*). The perfume made from nard from Maria from John 12 was probably added to this as well. 
The weight of this mixture has a different values in different Bible translations due to erroneous calculations, but approximately seventy-five pounds should be correct. 

*40 So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. 41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. 42 So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.*

I do not understand the "so because" here. What does the Preparation have to do with this tomb. It would not mean that because it was almost High Sabbath and because they were busy with preparations for the Pesach meal, they did not have much time left until the Sabbath started nor did they have much time because they were busy, and that because of these reasons they chose a tomb that was not too far away from Golgotha. I do not think this is the real explanation for choosing Joseph's tomb. 
In my personal view Joseph offered Jesus' mother or His brothers his own tomb. I do not expect that Jesus' brothers already had a tomb prepared for him, but it could be that they had a family tomb so that if one were to die, they would lay with their father and grandparents, just like the sons of Abraham did. This family tomb would most likely be in Nazareth or in Bethlehem where Joseph, the husband of Mary, who had probably already passed away, was originally from or at least his forefathers. If that was the situation then of course Jesus' family would have accepted Joseph of Arimathea's offer to use his tomb, because they could not let His dead body lay in their house, which perhaps would be a strange habit #todo/opzoeken/engels gewoonte? #todo/opzoeken is dit normaal in die cultuur? 
in Jewish culture, due to the Law which prohibits people from being near or touching dead corpses and becoming unclean even if one was in the same house. This would mean then that none of them in that case would be able to celebrate the Pesach meal. On the other hand, I do not think anyone cared more about the Pesach meal than Jesus of Whom at least Mary, I think, believed and knew was the Son of God and would happily forfeit their participation to the events surrounding Pesach. 
So aside from a shortage of time, the most likely far distance of their own possible family tomb, but also because no one had prepared or could arrange a tomb on such short notice nor did they probably had the money for it, they accepted Joseph of Arimathea's offer. Most of all, it happened because of the prophecy foretold in #todo/opzoeken .
