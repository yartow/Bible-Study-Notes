***THE HEALING AT BETHESDA***
After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
**2 **
Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep *gate*a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes.
3 
In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, [waiting for the moving of the waters;
4 
for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool and stirred up the water; whoever then first, after the stirring up of the water, stepped in was made well from whatever sickness with which he was afflicted.]
5 
And a man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years.
6 
When Jesus saw him lying *there*and knew that he had already been *sick*a long time, He said to him, “Do you wish to get well?”
7 
The sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, another steps down before me.”
8 
Jesus said to him, “Get up, pick up your mat and walk.”
9 
And immediately the man became well, and picked up his mat and *began to*walk.Now it was the Sabbath on that day.
10 
So the Jews were saying to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry your mat.”
11 
But he answered them, “He who made me well was the one who said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”
12 
They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Pick up *your mat*and walk’?”
13 
But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in *that*place.
14 
Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse happens to you.”
15 
The man went away, and disclosed to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
16 
And for this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.
17 
But He answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I Myself am working.”

***JESUS’ EQUALITY WITH THE FATHER***
18 For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.

How is it possible to call one **His own Father** and at the same time believe that He is **equal with God**? #biblestudy/questions One could say he is sent by God and therefore has specific rights, such as to work on the Sabbath, like an angel, one could even boast he is the Messiah and has to work on the Sabbath to bring about the salvation that the Bible promises, or one could interpret Jesus' words a God being His father, not as in a person who is *like* a father to many, but that God actually is His personal father, making Him closer to God than all other people. Even in that case Jesus would not claim He is God Himself. For sure the Jews did not believe in or know of the concept of the Trinity, but they knew from Jesus' words that He was **making Himself equal with God**.

19 Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing from Himself, unless *it is* something He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in the same manner.

Perhaps it really was so that the Jews had this dilemma, it was clear that Jesus made Himself equal with God, but He did not literally say He *was* God or He *was* the Father. He was proclaiming some kind of relation to the Father which they had not heard of before. 
The Jews had heard of the term *sons of God* (Deuteronomy 6:2) and even of those *being* gods (cf. Psalm 82:6 and John 10:34). Both cases in which he would claim to be an angel or an authority, respectively, would not be punishable by death, so it was clear that the Jews knew that Jesus was making Himself to be more than that. Jesus (again, probably) understood their dilemma #todo/opzoeken/engels twijfel and explains in the following verses what this relationship holds to. 

The first statement He gives is that **the Son can do nothing from Himself**. However, this does not *limit* Jesus' relationship and power to that of a servant of the Father, but only *increases* it! For who can say that **whatever the Father does, these things [he] also does in the same manner**? No man can say that, for every truthful person who sees the Law of God knows he is unable to follow this in exactly the same manner (Romans 3:23). 
Does this make Jesus a perfect servant of God then? Yes, but not a human one, for Jesus would be a perfect extension of God the Father, doing not only everything the Father *wants* but what the Father *does*. This would be impossible for man, but possible for God (cf. Luke 18:27)! For who can see the miracles that God is doing and then do these himself? 
This is the first characteristic of the relation between the Son and the Father.

#todo/opzoeken YouTube kung-fu met bamboe stokken en touw

20 For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and *the Father* will show Him greater works than these, so that you will marvel.

As an addition to the already amazing statement and relation between the Son and the Father, Jesus also claims that the Father will do even greater works, and thus the Son as well, namely the raising of the dead. 

21 For just as the Father raises the dead and gives *them*life, even so the Son also gives life to whom ::He:: wishes.

But Jesus then proceeds to the second characteristic, which is even more incredible, which is that the Son **gives life to whom He wishes**. This would almost seem as if the Son if surpassing the Father. Of course this is not true, for Jesus does not say contradicting things and the Son never contradicts the Father, but what happens here is that the Son may decide what he wishes and it will *always* be according to the Father's wishes because the Son can only do what He has already seen the Father doing. 
**Example.** If I had to give a hypothetical example, I would say: Suppose I live my wife and son on a deserted island. My son has every right to control the farm that I have there. Everything he knows and does he has learned from me or my wife. Now I carry over the work to him and he can decide what he wants to do with the farm. But whatever he decides, it will be done in the way that is pleasing to me, because he can do nothing else than what he has seen me doing. But it is *he* who is deciding, not *I*.

22 For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son, 23 so that all will honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.

In this case the most important thing is decided upon by Jesus, the *judgment* of who is guilty. I was inclined to write: "...who is guilty, and therefore will go to hell" but I refrained, because the judgment is that everyone is guilty. The next verse, however, provides the verdict. 
The *purpose* of why this judgment has been **given [...] to the Son** is **so that all will honor the Son even as they honor the Father.** The purpose is more honor and glory for Jesus as the Son of God. His glory has been covered ever since His incarnation in human form, as He *emptied* Himself (cf. Ephesians 2:5ff). His deity was fully present, but His glory was not. Later on in John 17 #todo/opzoeken/reference He will then ask that His glory will be shown again, just as much as it was before, indicating that presently He has less or it is shown less. For the Son of God was not on Earth to be glorified like a king, but He came to serve #todo/opzoeken/reference , even to serve humans and even to be humbled and die (Ephesians 2:10? #todo/opzoeken/reference ). 
More specifically, the purpose is that all will honor the Son *just as much* as they honor the Father. 
In the Old Testament period the people did not honor the Son, but now that all judgment has been given to Him, they will know Him and honor Him. 

So summarizing, the relationship between the Father and the Son is one where 
1. the Son can do everything He sees the Father doing
2. the Son can make judgment and only He does this
	1. Judgment has been given to the Son so that He would be honored (as much as the Father)


24 “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and ::believes:: Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.

One could interpret v.24 not as a promise, but as a statement, meaning that the one who believes will not *get* eternal life, but already *has*. The future **judgment** (the future tense is used here) is not for him, because the verdict has already passed, which is that we are *not guilty—anymore—* and therefore we have **passed out of death into life**. 
What about those who do not believe God then? What if someone believes God exists, but does not believe what He says? Does this person not have eternal life then? The simple answer is "yes", he does not have eternal life. But the more important question is, *can* this person come to believe God the Father and what He says about His Son? The answer to that is also "yes", provided it is given to this person and that this person is given to Jesus as well ( #todo/opzoeken/reference there are sheep who are not part of my flock yet, and John 17:2,6,11,12 all those whom you have given me ). 
Belief does not always come easily.  We already saw in John 4:48 that Jesus told the official whose son was sick that he would not believe unless he saw signs and wonders. Are we not just like the official? 
**Example.** I cannot give any credit to myself for believing in God I have seen many signs (and wonders) that helped me to believe. Everything that happened to me seems like it was constructed by God so that I would believe. Many times I have had bad things happening in my life after I had sinned—unrelated to my sin—and I found out this pattern of the consequences of sin. 
#todo/nogaftemaken about masturbation
But who told me of this pattern? No one told me that masturbation was sin, in school I was even taught that it is good and still on YouTube right now there are animated videos, specifically made for children, teaching boys and girls alike about this being perfectly normal, in essence stimulating children to do this. But I knew because it was God Who told me and He showed me through the consequences. 

**voorbeeld** over piano ook noemen hier? 
It was God Who intervened in my life and if He had not, I would not have believed in His existence nor in His Word.  
   
One matter of debate is the order of regeneration. The debate is about whether one needs to be regenerated first in order to be *able* to believe, or whether it is the other way around, that when first needs to believe and then becomes regenerated, and then get eternal life. The "extreme" Calvinist believes that one needs to regenerated first, because man cannot do anything out of his own power, not even believing. The other position is not that belief comes first and then regeneration, but that these two take place at the same time. Personally, I have a different opinion, which I will explain below. 
When I came to *believe* in God in the two examples mentioned above, did I have eternal life then? I think the answer is "no", because even though I believed, I had not given my life to Christ yet. That is to say that I believed only *parts* of the Gospel, namely that God is Who is says He is, that He is All-Knowing, Almighty, etc. I did not have the will yet to give up my whole life to Him Who died for me. The problem was that I believed what was said *about* Him, but not what He *said*, which is among others that one will get eternal life only when one loses his life #todo/opzoeken/reference . 
So in other words, v.24 is true, but must be interpreted such that one needs to know *and believe* (either by reading or hearing) Jesus' words, which is the Bible, and believing the Father's words, which is also the Bible, before he can have eternal life. One does not need to know the whole Bible, but only the crucial parts implied by the Gospel, namely that
1. Jesus is the Son of God and the second Person of the tri-une God
2. Jesus is one's personal lord and master.
3. Jesus died for our sins, but was raised to dead.

One might think of Act 8:6 as one reference to these requirements where the Ethopian eunuch asks what hinders him to be baptized. Philip's answer is recorded in the Textus Receptus in the KJV, but not in other versions. His answer was 
> (KJV) If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  

However, to me, the answer is correct, but not complete. Romans 10:9-10 provides a more complete answer:
> if you confess with your mouth Jesus *as* Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;  
This also forms the basis of the second point. Of course this point is made clear in the gospels as well, but here in Romans this has been summarized very well. 

Thus, when one believes these things, he has eternal life. 

***TWO RESURRECTIONS***
25 Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. 26 For just as the Father has life in Himself, even so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself; 27 and He gave Him authority to ::execute:: judgment, because He is the Son of Man.

Not only did Jesus has the right to **execute judgment** in the form of deciding on people's eternal destination, which is either in heaven or in hell. #todo/nogaftemaken ??

Jesus is not speaking of *all* the dead here, but at a specific group of chosen ones. If *all* **dead will hear** and if **those who hear will live**, this would mean that everyone who has died will have eternal life, and most certainly is not true. Rick Warren #tags/famouspeople/christian once said that everyone has eternal life, but that it is either in heaven or in hell. While this is true in our understanding, when the Bible speaks of eternal life, this is always about the part in heaven. Therefore v.29 speaks of **resurrection of judgment** as opposed to the **resurrection of life**, for "life" in hell is not deemed as actually being life—at least not in the way planned it (cf. John 10:10 where Jesus has come to give us *life*).

However, v.28 does speak about every person who has ever died, but it distinguishes between those who have done the **good deeds**, which is making the right choice of choosing for Jesus, who will be resurrected to **life** while those who have **committed the evil deeds**—by making the wrong choice of not choosing for Jesus—will be raised up to life as well, but only to be judged then. 
The question then becomes where the latter go to after they are dead. If their judgment comes only at this foretold **hour**, what happens to them in the mean time? Jesus answered to this these people were already judged 

**28 Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice, 29 and will come forth; those who did the good deeds to a resurrection of life, those who committed the evil deeds to a resurrection of judgment.**

These are the two resurrections the pericope refers to. *MacSBNnkjv* mentions another "sort of resurrection" having taken place, which is the "spiritual" resurrection of those who have been born again. 

**30 “I can do nothing from Myself. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is righteous, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.** 

**31 “If I *alone* bear witness about Myself, My witness is not true. 32 There is another who bears witness about Me, and I know that the witness which He gives about Me is true.**

Jesus' judgment is righteous, because He seeks the will of the Father. Not only does he **seek** this, He knows it and executes it exactly in the way the Father would. 
How do we know that Jesus really seeks the will of the Father? If we know that, then His first statement is true. We know Jesus speaks the truth because He has witnesses.

**WITNESSES TO JESUS: THE FATHER AND THE SCRIPTURES**
33 You have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth. 34 But the witness I receive is not from man, but I say these things so that you may be ::saved::. 35 He was the lamp that was burning and shining and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. 
36 But the witness I have is greater than *the witness of* John; for the works which the Father has given Me to ::finish⁠::—the very works that I do⁠—bear witness about Me, that the Father has sent Me.

The first witness are the works of Jesus, which bear witness about Jesus. Note that in John 17:4 Jesus says that he has finished the work He was given to do. His greatest work was yet to be done, i.e. His death on the cross and His resurrection, and that work would bear the greatest witness about Him, for they would prove that He is God and the Victor of death. 

37 And the Father who sent Me, He has borne witness about Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His form. 38 And you do not have His word abiding in you, ::for:: you do not believe Him whom He sent.

This is a bold statement to make. At the same time no one can refute Jesus and say they have heard His voice, for they would need proof of that. Even if anyone said anything about how God had spoken to him, either in a dream or in another way, Jesus could refute them and exactly tell them what they had dreamt (cf. the story of Joseph and the dream of the Pharaoh). 

In order to prove the point He makes in v.38 Jesus would need to prove that He was sent by the Father. If He has proven that, He will have proven that He speaks the truth, and if He speaks the truth, it is true that the Jews do not have the God's word abiding in them. 
Jesus had already proven *beyond doubt* through His works that He was sent by God. Even if others performed miracles as well, like the Pharaoh's magicians #todo/opzoeken/engels  #todo/opzoeken/reference in Moses' time, Jesus' miracles surpassed theirs. There is no example of this described in His lifetime in the Gospels, but Acts 16:16-18 describe how a girl with supernatural powers would lose all of her power through the words of Paul which he uses in the Name of Jesus. 
Thus, we can conclude that because the Jews did not believe **Him Whom [the Father] sent**, i.e. Jesus, therefore they **do not have [God's] word abiding** in them.

Some might argue that the Jews do believe the Father but not Jesus. The only valid argument I can accept are those Jews who have been isolated from the world and have never heard of Jesus and are forbidden to read the prophecies that depict Jesus very clearly, such as Isaiah 53. 1 John 2:23 is very clear, however, that "[e]veryone who denies the Son does not have the Father". 

39 You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that bear witness about Me;
40 and you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.

If anyone does not know how to get eternal life, one needs only to **search the Scriptures**. The Jews cannot find the answer and so they search even harder, thinking that there must be many laws they must keep in order to please God. Yes, God has said many times that the one who abides in Him or in His Word will live forever (in both the Old and the New Testament, see e.g. 1 John 2:17) but one must understand that it is not a salvation by works but one by grace alone. If it were by works, every people could have become children of God, and if that were the case, then why did the Jews treat the gentiles with such disdain? 
Somewhere inside of them this paradox was present which they were unaware of themselves. But why was there an unwillingness to come to Christ **so that [they] may have life**? It could either have been that they did not know and therefore kept looking, or it could be that they did see the answer, and that it was the Christ who would reign (they must have known this through e.g. Psalms 2, 110) and provide salvation but that they also realized that with the coming of Christ, all honor would go to Him and Him alone (Philippians 2:10). 

41 I do not receive glory from men; 42 ::but:: I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.

If v.41-42 is written together with v.40 this becomes (paraphrased): #composed/bible/john 
> ... you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life. 41 However, I am not saying this because I want to receive glory from you, but because you have a problem, and that is that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.  

This part can be read as if Jesus is speaking very gently to the Jews, urging them to rethink their position on the way to salvation. In the following verses He then argues that the Jews cannot believe when they are still self-centered, seeking glory for themselves from others, instead of seeking **the glory that is from the only God**. Why would this self-centeredness be conflicting with one's belief? The answer is that when one believes what God says in Psalm 110 for example, the Messiah is the One Who will get all the glory, He is the One Who will rule the nations. The Messiah is also the One Who will have *no form or majesty [...] and no beauty [...] despised and rejected by men* (Isaiah 53:2-3). If the Messiah is like that, putting all glory that was actually due Him aside, how can one who believes in the Messiah—who should be His servants—strive to obtain as much as glory as possible?

43 I have come in My Father’s name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his ::own:: name, you will receive him. 44 How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that is from the only God?

There is another argument against the Jews and that is that they receive others who come in their **own name**. Would this not be contradictory, especially when these others take away their honor? By allowing others to come in their own name, they uphold a culture of coming in one's own name. So if they accept this behavior and introduce this to the people as morally acceptable, they too can behave this way, and the people would find this less peculiar. 
Leaders of sects and cults who are narcissistic (usually by definition, in other words, there are no leaders of cults who are not narcissists #todo/opzoeken ) are always very careful with and good at convincing their members of their own moral standards. This will almost always involve (again, by definition) the giving of large amounts of money and sexual immorality, such as that a leader should be allowed to have multiple wives or be allowed to sleep with the wives of members. 
In the Qur'an #tags/religion/islam or in the hadith (the commentaries) is written that the "prophet" Muhammad captured a woman and wanted to have sex with her. I do not know if he imposed a new rule on the fly allowing this kind of behavior—which he seemingly did do when he was hungry, and then allowed the meat of camels and rabbits, even though he held to kosher food laws before that. What is certain, though, is that he did not condemn other leaders and peoples and tribes for having this kind of sexually immoral behavior. If he had done so, this would have backfired on him for being hypocritical when he would have done this. So by condoning this kind of behavior, he allowed his people—especially the men—to know that these are rights that men have over women. 
This argument makes it obvious then why they could not accept Jesus' morally correct behavior, for if they did, the people would not accept their behavior anymore. They would not accept their way of praying and tithing where they received much honor (see Matthew 6), and if the story with the adulterous woman in John 8 has actually happened (for it is not certain whether this text was part of the original Gospel of John, but see notes there), these events and events like how Jesus invited tax collecters such as Matthew and Zaccheus would become precedents that would very negatively impact the view of the people on the hypocritical Jewish leaders. 

45 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; the one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have set your hope. 46 For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me, for he wrote about Me. 47 But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?”

Jesus could have meant the books of Moses, or perhaps the whole Tanakh, i.e. the Old Testament. Either way, both speak of the coming of Jesus. 
Jesus is warning them that the person whom or that thing which they have set their hopes on will prove to be wrong. For the Law of Moses will not save them and Moses himself can not and will not save them either, for they did not believe his writings when he wrote of the Prophet among their brothers who would come, in Deuteronomy 18:15, not even when Jesus words came to pass (Deuteronomy 18:22) after His resurrection, after which the Jews should and must have known that Jesus was this Prophet that Moses spoke of.
