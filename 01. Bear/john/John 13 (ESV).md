***Jesus Washes the Disciples' Feet***
*1 Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. 2 During supper, when ::the devil had already put it into the heart:: of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,*

The first thing I note here is that Jesus might not have even finished His meal, for it was *during* supper that Jesus rose, not after. Including all the speaking that Jesus did on His final evening, it would seem logical that Jesus would not have had much time to eat. Also, knowing that it was His final hour, He probably would not have had felt much for eating anyway. Most noteworthy is that this thing that Jesus was about to do was more important than food. Aside from His lifestyle of and teaching about humility, Jesus showed this explicitly and practically in this example. 

The second noteworthy thing in this verse is that the devil had put this longing to betray Jesus in Judas' heart. We are told that it is our own evil desires (see James 1:14) that causes us to sin. Definitely, the fault for Judas' sin is all his, for he did not had to act upon this desire and his whole scheme of betraying Jesus to priests of the Sanhedrin was not an impulsive action but a malicious thought-out plan (see also verse 27).

*3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, 4 rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist.*

I do not know how many garments Jesus wore, but I presume it is one dress like garment, from shoulder to ankles. Underneath there was probably some kind of underwear. What an embarrassment it would be for a present-day leader to strip down to his underwear, squat or kneel down and wash the feet of his disciples. The pope washes the feet, but only by ritual—leaving aside the fact that the feet he washes are relatively clean compared to those of the disciples—not stripping down and even then he is enjoying full publicity of what he is doing. Humility is not part of the game there. 

*5 Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. 6 He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?” 7 Jesus answered him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.” 8 Peter said to him, “You shall never wash my feet.”*

Peter's impulsive response shows—at least to me—disrespectfulness. How can Peter speak like this to his lord? How can he command or supposedly predict what the Lord will or will not do? How can he not have learned this from Jesus' behavior after three years?
This shows that even after three years under the tutelage of Jesus, Peter was still far from the man he would become as soon as the Holy Spirit would permanently reside in him. It shows that man's transformation can only occur with the power of the Holy Spirit and that both character (in this case, Peter's impulsiveness and brashness) as well as understanding are given by the Holy Spirit. 

*Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.” 9 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!”*

If Peter does not let Jesus wash his feet, he is refusing to be served by jesus. It is not that he refuses Jesus' salvation---for in the next verse we read that the washing of feet is for those who have already received the bath, which is salvation---but refusing one´s feet to be washed is equivalent to refusing to remember Jesus' through the Holy Supper. 
Another complementary explanation is that refusal of letting one's feet be washed indicates a refusal to follow Jesus' example of washing other's feet, which Jesus requires of His disciples. One can have no part in Jesus' kingdom if he refuses to serve others. This is not contradictory to the next verse where Jesus says that those who have bathed are clean, for Jesus' statement is that those who are truly saved will follow Jesus in serving others. It is always all or nothing. 

Jesus speaks to Peter in several contexts here. When Jesus says Peter has no share with Him if he does not allow Him to wash his feet, Jesus is speaking of the kingdom. 
But when Jesus is speaking about someone who has bathed, does not need to be bathed again, The washing of feet is actuated by the remembrance of Him and symbolized by the Holy Supper. 

*10 Jesus said to him, “The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.” 11 For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, “Not all of you are clean.”*
*12 When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done to you? 13 You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. 14 If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. 15 For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you.*

Washing the feet is only an example, the true meaning of this is humility and servanthood #todo/opzoeken difference between servanthood and servitude. 

*16 Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. 17 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.*

There is no person who can sincerely say that Jesus is his master, but not have the attitude of servanthood of Jesus, for if one were to do so, he would think of himself greater than Jesus. Any disciple would choose a position lower than that of his master and since Jesus already went to the lowest position—not only by washing their feet and becoming the lowest slave of all slaves, He also gave His life for the ungodly (see Romans 5:6-7) while they were still enemies of God—this means that disciples of Jesus should take a position even lower than that!

*18 I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But the Scripture will be fulfilled, He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.’*

This is the second time Jesus referring to Judas, when He says "not all of you." The first time was in verse 11 and the third and final time is an elaboration of the scripture quoted here and will be explained as clear as can be in verse 26. 

*19 I am telling you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place you may believe that I am he.*

The Scriptures not only prophesy about Jesus' character traits and events such as His riding on the donkey, but it also shows that Jesus is the Messiah through those prophecies in which the Messiah the object of betrayal. So even though being betrayed is not positive event, Jesus had to go through so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled and so that it would be clear to everyone that Jesus is the Messiah. 

*20 Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.”*

This verse seems to be separate from the context above and below it, but Jesus would not randomly mention this without meaning. This verse is related to verse 17, however, and verses 18-19 are actually a sidenote. In the second half of this verse Jesus makes it clear, once again, that He is sent by the Father and that in order to receive the Father, they must receive Him. At the same time those who are sent by Jesus, which are the disciples He is talking to, will be received by those who have actually received God. 

***One of You Will Betray Me***
*21 After saying these things, Jesus was troubled in his spirit, and testified, “Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.” 22 The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke. 23 One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table at Jesus' side, 24 so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. 25 So that disciple, leaning back against Jesus, said to him, “Lord, who is it?” 26 Jesus answered, “It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it.” So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. 27 Then after he had taken the morsel, Satan ::entered:: into him. Jesus said to him, “What you are going to do, do quickly.”*

In verse 2 the devil had merely *put* this desire to betray Jesus in his heart, but Judas himself made the final decision to accept the morsel and thereby signifying his actual decision to betray him. This is when he opened the doors of his heart for Satan to enter it. 
Before this Judas already had a desire, one way or another, to betray Jesus, because he also stole from Him. See James 1:13, each is enticed by their own desires. 

*28 Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. 29 Some thought that, because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, “Buy what we need for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor. 30 So, after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.*

It is remarkable that none of the disciples understood what Jesus meant. Although not all the disciples could hear Jesus when He was speaking softly, because of the way the they *reclined* at the table, which was on one side, #todo/opzoeken foto 
those who did hear, still did not understand, not even John. Perhaps the only one who understood was Judas, and even that is not certain. 

***A New Commandment***
*31 When he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 32 If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at ::once::.*

The glorification process of Jesus did not take three days to start, but started immediately. The process itself could have taken more than a day, so that Jesus' body was fully glorified on the Sunday morning, but that seems unlikely. In human terms it took "three days and three nights" before we saw it. The body was seen right before it entered the grave and on the morning of the third day, but in between we do not know what happened with it or how long it took. 

*33 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’*

Jesus tells the Jews in John 8:21 that they cannot come to where He is going. However, He also says in John 7:34 "*where I ~am~ you cannot come*". Additionally, He says in John 14:3 to His disciples that they will know where He is going and that they will even be where He *will be* after His resurrection. 
So there is a distinction to be made between 
* to whom Jesus is speaking (either the Jews or His disciples, i.e. both the Twelve and all other followers) and 
* the location of where He is, will be, or where He is going to, and lastly 
* when all of this applies
For the last point, verse 36 adds an extra dimension of time indicating that regardless of who it is to whom He is speaking and whether He is talking about where is or will be, one can only find or not find Him depending on the right time. 

*34 A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. 35 By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”*

This is one of the most important verses of the Bible. First of all it already implies the greatest Commandments of all, to love God and one another—one cannot go without the other—but here Jesus supersedes that and raises the bar by specifying that we should love each other *exactly in the way* He loved us. 
This not only puts us to a higher standard, but it also specifies how we should do this, because before this command was clear to people, they could love and treat others in any way as long as they did it to themselves as well. Gangster bosses such as #todo/opzoeken  the one in Colombia loved himself so much he would indulge himself with all kinds of materialism and addictions and idolatries, perhaps not to cocaine, but most certainly to power. Another example where things go wrong is where parents have fed their child to become the most obese child in the world, weighing a #todo/opzoeken  150kg at age 10, because they could not stand him crying for more food. This, of course, is a wrong kind of love, most certainly leaning towards codependency, and not the kind of love that Jesus has for us. 

***Jesus Foretells Peter's Denial***
*36 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered him, “Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but you will follow afterward.” 37 Peter said to him, “Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.” 38 Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times.*

Just like Peter, we tend to estimate ourselves too highly and we make our promises based on that. Peter thought he was brave, but at the right time and in the right situation his fear of the Roman soldiers took the better of him. It is striking that in the beginning he was not even afraid to cut off the ear of the Roman soldier in order to protect Jesus. That, however, was out of rashness and impulsivity. His body was acting faster than his thoughts did, but as soon as he had time to think, fear took over him. 
It is of utmost importance that we do not act in rashness like Peter did, neither with our tongue which causes disruptions (see James 3) or with our bodies in any offensive way, both to other people as well as to the Law. Rather, we should think carefully and patiently, being self-controlled (see James 1:19). This might lead to irrational thoughts and it would conquer us with more fear, indeed, but it would be better than an impulsive jump off the cliff only to realize later on what we have done. However, we should know that even though Peter was afraid—which was a logical response to seeing the many Roman soldiers, the well-known enmity of the chief priests and the Pharisees against Christ and His disciples, and the punishments that could be afflicted by either party—Peter still could have, and would so later on in life, prayed for power from the Holy Spirit, through faith, and God would have granted Him this. This could have meant that Peter would have been flogged and crucified along with Jesus that day, but the faith in the Father would allow any Christian to at least know that it was all in His hands and part of His plan.
