# John 5 (ESV) 
***The Healing at the Pool on the Sabbath***
*1 After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.*
*2 Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, in Aramaic called Bethesda, which has five roofed colonnades.*

The Sheep Pool #todo/opzoeken  also named the Upper Pool or ... andere naam? had not been found for a long time and had been thought of as a myth until recently. #todo/nogaftemaken 

*3 In these lay a multitude of invalids—blind, lame, and paralyzed. 5 One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.*

Jesus only performed two healings in Jerusalem, in the Gospel of John, of which this is one, the other being the healing of a blind man at the Pool of Shiloah or Shiloam, also named the Lower Pool because of its lower altitude in the south east of Jerusalem as compared to the Upper Pool in the north east. 

Approximately 1000 years earlier, the Jebusites told David #todo/opzoeken/reference (2 Samuël 5:6) that David had no chance of defeating they city for it was so well-protected on at least two sides, with the valley of Jehoshaphath #todo/opzoeken/engels/spelling on the east side and the valley of #todo/opzoeken  on the west, that even the blind and the lame could protect the city. David eventually did conquer the city by using that which was the life source of the city, the Gihon spring, which was their only source of water and an entrance for David and his men to enter the city. The Gihon spring was located outside of the eastern city walls, but there was a certain construction on the wall to pass through the wall and descend to the spring. 
Hezekiah later protected the city by rerouting #todo/opzoeken  the Gihon spring's flow to a lower place that ended up in and filled the newly created Pool of Shiloah and moved the city walls to go around this pool. 
Practically speaking Hezekiah protected the city by making them independent of an external source of life. Spiritually speaking we need to protect ourselves by getting this spring of living water within our "walls", that is the walls of our hearts.

Hezekiah spent much time and money to build the Tunnel of Hezekiah and to move the walls. He could have built the new walls first and then broken down the old ones, which would be safer but more costly. It could also be that he broke down the old one first, which would be more cost-effective, but imposing a big risk with the Assyrians on the #todo/opzoeken/engels op komst. 
As for the tunnels, he dug this from two sides, which is faster, but there was a big chance that the two tunnels would not connect to each other. He needed to do this fast because of the threat of the oncoming Assyrians. 
A spiritual application is that the Christian can be under stress as well. The first thing we need to know then is that we should not choose the easy way. We should go for the way that provides the solution fastest, regardless of the cost and effort, but we should do it with precision, or the solution will not have any effect and one may be even worse off. 

Jesus starts His conquest of the city here, though in a different way than David did. Whereas David conquered it physicially, Jesus needed to conquer it spiritually. Of course the city and all of Creation is already His, but the prince of this world, the Satan, is ruling, and Jesus needed to show the people that He is conqueror. Now whereas the Jebusites mocked David and figuratively mentioned the blind and the lame, David did the same thing in response (2 Samuel 5:8). Jesus, however, did this literally by healing the blind and the lame. 
David defeated his attackers—the "blind and the lame"—but Jesus removed them by healing them. The "blind and lame" were "hated by David's soul" (2 Samuel 5:8), but they were loved by Jesus. The contrast is explicit. Where one would remove his enemies by killing them, Jesus removes His by turning them into friends. #church/material/sermon

*6 When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him, “Do you want to be healed?” 7 The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am going another steps down before me.” 8 Jesus said to him, “Get up, take up your bed, and walk.” 9 And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked.*

The text says nothing about the man's belief in Jesus' words nor in His Person as the Son of God, but it were the words of Jesus that had power to heal the man. 

*Now that day was the Sabbath. 10 So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.” 11 But he answered them, “The man who healed me, that man said to me, ‘Take up your bed, and walk.’” 12 They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take up your bed and walk’?” 13 Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place.*

*14 Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you.”*

It is not clear whether this man was crippled because of his sin. However, Jesus does warn him to **[s]in no more** because what happens when sin takes control over one's life is even **worse** than being crippled for 38 years, namely death (cf. James 1:15). 

*15 The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.*

Nothing is said of the man's bad intentions to betray **Jesus who healed him**. It could very well be that he wanted to give honor to Jesus by telling others that Jesus is the healer. The effect, however, was the opposite. 
Perhaps it was for this reason that elsewhere Jesus told #todo/opzoeken the blind man? that he must not tell anyone who it was who healed him. 

*16 And this was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath. 17 But Jesus answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I am working.”*

If the Jews were really honest, they had to persecute the crippled man as well. In the court of law, however, their case would not stand, because the man merely listened to someone who had the power to heal him and must have been at least a prophet, that is a man he had to obey. Also, if Jesus were brought before court for this reason the case would not stand against Him (cf. Matthew 10:19) for He had already rebutted them on this matter (cf. Luke 14:5). The death penalty for working on the Sabbath was for those working for profit, their career or anything else that is selfish. The judges had—hopefully—enough knowledge of the Law to interpret that in the right way. 

***Jesus Is Equal with God***
*18 This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.*

One will find many debates on YouTube concerning the fact whether Jesus had called Himself  God. They claim that even from the Gospels it cannot be found that Jesus said He was God. Granted, Jesus did not literally say "I am God", but there are many places where Jesus did this  clearly enough. As a matter of fact He did this so clearly that the Jews wanted to kill Him for it. Even more so, this is the *only* reason why wanted to kill Him. We see at the Galilee #todo/opzoeken/reference  that people tried to throw stones at Jesus, and in #todo/opzoeken/reference they tried to push Him off a cliff.


***The Authority of the Son***
*19 So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise.*

This does not mean that the Son has no power, but it indicates the unity between the Father and the Son. The unity between Christian brothers and sisters or between even a husband and a wife is not so much united as that of the Holy Trinity. A man can move independently of his wife, but one Person of the Trinity cannot have any independence of the other. Perhaps it is not even because they do not *want* to (I do not know the answer), but it is because the *cannot* do. 
**Example.** Take for example an iron rod. One part of this rod cannot move in any direction without any other part moving along with it. Or take a broom #biblestudy/theology/trinity, the brush will always move in the direction of the stick. The brush cannot do anything unless the stick moves. We cannot say, however, that the brush is the same as the stick. 

The rest of the notes are continued in [[John 5 (LSB)]]. 

*20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel. 21 For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. 22 For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, 23 that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. 24 Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.*
*25 “Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. 26 For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. 27 And he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man. 28 Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice 29 and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.*

***Witnesses to Jesus***
*30 “I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me. 31 If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not true. 32 There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true. 33 You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth. 34 Not that the testimony that I receive is from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved. 35 He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. 36 But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father has sent me. 37 And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. His voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen, 38 and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom he has sent. 39 You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, 40 yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life. 41 I do not receive glory from people. 42 But I know that you do not have the love of God within you. 43 I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him. 44 How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? 45 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope. 46 For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. 47 But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?”*
