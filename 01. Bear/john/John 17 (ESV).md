# John 17 (ESV) 
***The High Priestly Prayer***
*1 When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, “Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you,*

In John 12:28 Jesus asks for the Father's Name to be glorified. In John 14:13 He asks that the Father may be glorified in the son. In this verse He asks that the Son Himself may be glorified. 
In John 16:14 the Spirit glorifies Jesus. Nowhere, however, do we read that the Spirit is ever glorified.

*2 since you have given him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. 3 And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.*

Does Jesus mean that knowing God is eternal life or that by knowing God (in the most intimate way) one will obtain eternal life? We know the latter is true, but this verse seems like a statement. Now some people here on Earth know God, if not in the present day then at least people like David and Moses. But these did not have eternal life. 
If we add verse 2 to the equation, however, we see that Jesus gives eternal life to all the chosen ones (literally, those who have been given to Jesus). Combined with verse 3 this means that Jesus has given knowledge of God, the Father *and* Jesus Christ to the chosen ones. 

*4 I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do.*

Jesus tells the Father He has accomplished the work for which He came here on Earth. What a big task this was, a 33-year "project" with the ultimate goal of dying for a race of people who did not and would not appreciate what He did. Even 2000 years later most people would still not appreciate this, accept his forgiveness and most would not even believe He was resurrected! It would be like Houdini #tags/famouspeople performing a life-threatening trick and of all attendants most would not even care to look. After everything had happened they would not believe it either, while there were many witnesses, but they did not even bother asking the witnesses or wondering whether it happened or why he would do such a thing. #stories/bible/gospel #todo/nogaftemaken

*5 And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed.*

What does "in Your own presence" mean? Does it mean that the Father can glorify persons without being in their presence as well? Or is Jesus saying that He wants to be glorified by being in the Father's presence, just like a person would say he has enough glory in meeting the President, even without receiving a medal. Also, Jesus is speaking of the "kind" of glory that He had before He came to Earth. Jesus wants to have this glory back. Does this mean there are other forms of glory then? In the strictest sense the answer is *yes*, for there is glory for winning a war and for becoming a scholar for example in the classical age of China when a whole village paid for tuition and rooted for you. 
I think these words need to be interpreted at face value. Jesus wants to be in the Father's presence and He wants to get back to the situation of before His incarnation. Even though the Father is everywhere at all times (Footnote: Was He present in Jesus when He was full of punishment on the cross when Jesus said the Father had left Him?) Jesus is looking for a more intimate expression. Just like Moses was with Moses all the time, there were different levels of intimacy. On Mount Sinai perhaps was the most intimate revelation of God's glory, the second most intimate was when God showed His back to Moses, then came the meeting in the *Tent of Meeting* and then the other meetings with God, which are not described how Moses received the words from God. Jesus is looking for something even more intimate than anything anyone had ever seen, to be in the full presence and glory of God, which God spoke of to Moses (see Exodus 33:20 where God says that no man can see God's face and live). 

*6 “I have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world. Yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.*

It is not very clear (to me) whether Jesus is speaking of His close disciples here, including perhaps Mary, Martha and other disciples, or of those that have been predestined. There were many people in the villages and cities Jesus passed through who believed in Him, but they did not have the opportunity to listen to all the words spoken by Christ. 
This is also unclear because it says that "they have kept Your Word" while we know that the disciples did not keep all of God's Word—they left Jesus for example—but also could they, like everyone else, never keep all of the Law. This latter might be taken "figuratively", as in that the disciples did their best to keep God's Word, except for Judas of course. 

*7 Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you. 8 For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me.*

*9 I am praying for them. ::I am not praying for the world:: but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.*

There are several theories concerning the doctrine of predestination or more specifically election #biblestudy/theology/predestination/election#. These verses are strong indicators of the veracity of this doctrine. Jesus did not pray for those not given to them. We pray for all of the world, including our enemies, because we do not know whether they have been given by the Father, but we also ask God to do as He wills (cf. Matthew 26:39). Jesus, however, knows who has been given to Him by the Father and therefore He can pray more specifically for people. 
This begs the question then whether there is a chance of salvation for those whom Jesus does *not* pray for. The Bible says that “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” (Romans 10:9,13) which is quoted from Joel 2:32. However, there are at least two possible arguments to bring into this. First, who will call on the Name of the Lord? Is this not only those whose eyes and ears and hearts have been opened *by God*? Isaiah 32:3 shows it is God who opens the eyes (of the Israelites) and Romans 3:11 (quoted from Psalm 14:2) shows that no one seeks God. So if God had chosen them, they were already part of those whom had been given to Jesus. 
Second, "everyone" could refer to all nations, as is clearly the theme in the book of Romans (see Romans 1:16), not to literally *everyone*, but this is just my guess. 

*10 All mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in ::them::. 11 And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one. 12 While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost except ::the son of destruction::, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.*

The son of destruction is referring to Judas. 
These verses indicate that whomever is kept by Jesus will not be lost. There is the argument of proponents such as David Pawson #tags/famouspeople/christian of Arminianism #biblestudy/theology/calvinism/osas that it is true that nobody, not even the Satan, can take anyone from God's hand, but that someone *can* decide to jump out of God's hand voluntarily. This contradicts this verse, however, because the only ones who will be lost, are exceptions and only in order to fulfill Scripture. Scripture says nothing about the millions of "Christians" who are lost such as Joshua Harris #tags/famouspeople and perhaps even Ravi Zacharias (although he never admitted, but John MacArthur claims #todo/opzoeken that he is not a Christian), and the fact that it is millions of Christians we are talking about, perhaps even millions per year, indicates that these are not exceptions.

*13 But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.*

I am not completely certain of which things Jesus is speaking, which would bring in joy in His disciples. Perhaps this is about the news that Jesus is going back to the Father (cf. John 14:28 where Jesus says that if His disciples really loved Him, they would rejoice upon hearing of His return to His Father).  

*14 I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.*

Though this whole paragraph seems to be one piece—in the ESV it is only indented twice, the second time occuring at verse 20—it seems as if there are some lines of this prayer that are unrelated to the rest. 
Here in verse 14, for example, Jesus speaks of having given the word of His Father to His disciples, which are His promises and a some revelations I would suppose, but then it says "and the world has hated them... because they are not of the world." What is the relationship between the word and the world? It is not saying that the world hated them because they received the world, but because they are not of the world. Why, however, is this part about the word written in the same sentence? It seems as if there is a direct relation between receiving the word and being out of the world, and if there is, it is this: even since the disciples have received the Word of God, the world has hated them because they are not of the world anymore. They started behaving differently, wishing and longing differently, speaking and acting differently and most of all loving differently. 

*15 I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one.*

Now the quickest solution would be for Christians to be taken out of this world so that they would not be hated by the world anymore, but in that case the world would not see Christ's light, the love of Christ and know that Christ has been sent by God. Instead, God asks them to keep them from the evil one. 
Note that Jesus is not asking that Christians are *protected* from the evil one in the sense that they will not be beaten or persecuted. That would perhaps be an even more effective strategy than asking for us to go into heaven, for in heaven we would not be hurt but we would also not be able to spread the light to the world, *with protection*, on the other hand, we would be able to dwell safely in this world, and spread the light. However, there is a caveat and that is that the effectivity of spreading the light would not be very high. 
Spreading light, as with all emissions of energy, requires a fuel source, whether that is electricity or gasoline. The darkness defined by God is that place and situation in which people live along with their *response* to it. So darkness is not for example the Bronx in New York, the Hood in L.A. or a ghetto in Chicago, but it is how people live in their neighborhoods. If they go along with the criminality and put their morals aside, they have created darkness and have gone living in it. But if they decide, despite all the societal factors that push them into this direction of going on the wrong path, to walk in the right paths, that will be fuel for the light. 
Now the stronger these "magnetic" forces are pulling one towards darkness, the stronger the light will be when one escapes from it, just like in the generating of electricity. 
So rather than asking for our protection from the evil one, Jesus asks for keeping us, that is not letting us become the Satan's. This still means that our bodies may get beaten and we may be mocked and slandered or even killed, but we will not become part of the Satan's kingdom. This allows for the strong forces of Satan's kingdom to pull on us, and for us to emit an even stronger light to shine in his darkness.  #church/material

*16 They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. 17 Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. 18 As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. 19 And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.*

These verses combined together seem as if Christians need protection when being sent into the world, and therefore Christ has immersed us through sanctification in the Word, as an invisible protective layer against the sin and lies of this world. 
Jesus was sent into this world and He consecrated Himself first. 
#stories/bible/idea This to me provides the image of a diver who wears a wetsuit or drysuit and dives into the waterworld. He is the only one to wear this suit and through his air he can let others live. Now this diver asks his father, who is on the surface to let them wear this suit of truth as well, so that they may live. 
The diver could have asked the father to take them out of the water, but he is not doing that, because these people still have a task under water. 

If Jesus had not consecrated himself, His disciples would not be sanctified in truth. In order for the whole plan of the Resurrection and the accompanying victory over sin and death, as well as over the Satan, to succeed, Jesus had to stay consecrated up until the moment He died on the cross. Only then His offer was worthy enough to be sufficient for all of mankind. 
So it is for *our* sake that Jesus consecrated Himself. Without this consecration of Jesus, where He set Himself apart from anything but the Father's will, the truth would be something else. The truth would then be some situation where the Satan obtained a victory. 
But now, because Jesus conquered, this has become the truth, the Word has become the truth and He has become the truth for He is the Word. The Word has always been the truth, but when it spoke of the future tense—in human terms—this is not truth because it has not been proven yet. Of course in Biblical terms we know that something is truth when God *says* it because it will then happen that way, because all laws of nature and logic must follow God's will. 


*20 “I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word, 21 that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me.*

Here Jesus speaks of His disciples when He uses "these", but the rest of the world *who have been chosen* with "those". 

*22 The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, 23 I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them ::even as you loved me::.* 

The first observation we make from these two verses is that Christians are not able to become one as Christ and the Father are one unless they receive the glory that the Father has given to the Son. The second observation is that goal of this oneness is that the world may know that Christ was sent by the Father and that the Father loves the world just as much as He loves Christ. 
This is something we need to dive deeper into. First of all, how can God's glory create unity among Christians? I think glory is meant here in the broadest sense of the word. Glory by itself, for example when an Olympic medallist decides to give his glory to the second ranking contestant, would mean this other contestant gets a medal, a name and the consequent contracts and promotion. However, it does not change anything in this person's performance or character. Rather yet, it might be possible that even becomes arrogant due to his status.
*God's* glory on the other hand includes the victory. The Father is stronger than death and has given His glory to the Son, Who has conquered death, Who has given His glory to us, so that we can conquer sin. *Everything* that disrupts unity is caused by sin, but because we have conquered sin *in Christ*, we can reach this perfect oneness. 
Now if we, Christians, show this perfect unity and also the glory of God, the conquering of sin, the goodness of God and all of God's other attributes, the people of this world will see how much we love them and realize that this is a love from outside of Earth, different from all other religions. This will understand through our love for them that it is not our love, but that it is the Father's love for them. 
The world can experience this love first hand then, but how will they know that Jesus Christ was sent by the Father? Everyone knows in their heart that if there is a God, the One God Who created the universe and everything in it, He must be a good God. People who have experience the love of Christ know that this love that He gives, is good. It must come from the one God. If Christ's love were a love with strings attached, the world will not think this love is from God, but it is a worldly love, or of an idol, a fake god that is not able to love unconditionally. This love from Jesus is so different that no other religion can imitate it or even come close to it. 

*24 Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world.*

When someone loves you and you realize this, you want to do what is best for that person. You want to honor that person. My father has taught me several recipes and secret tricks in perfecting the dish and I honor him by letting others taste this dish. This recipe that has been given to me I want to share with others so that they can see my father's recipe. 
In the same way Jesus wants to show His followers His glory, because this glory has been given to Him by the Father, because the Father loved Jesus. 

*25 O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me.*

There are three groups of persons here: those who know the Father, those who know that Jesus has been sent by the Father, and those who do not know the Father. The first group are Jesus and the Holy Spirit; the second group are the Christians and the third group is the rest of unbelieving world. Part of this third group has been chosen by the Father. A question concerning verse 26 is whether Jesus is continuing to make known the Name of the Father in those who are believers, so that they know His Name better—for a Christian will never completely know God's Name until he has seem Him face to face in heaven—or whether it means that Jesus will spread God's Name among the unbelievers. 

*26 I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.”*

When a person does not know God's Name, His love is not in that person and therefore Jesus is not in that person either. So besides our unability to unite we are also unable to love with the love of God.
