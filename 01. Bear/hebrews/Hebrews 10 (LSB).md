# Hebrews 10 (LSB)
### Christ’s Sacrifice Once for All
> **Heb. 10:1**   For the Law, since it has*only*aa shadow of bthe good things to come*and* not the very 1form of things, 2can cnever, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year, dmake perfect those who draw near. **2** Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have aconsciousness of sins? **3** But ain 1those*sacrifices* there is a reminder of sins year by year.   

A **shadow of the good things to come [...] can never [...] make perfect** the person who sinned. It is like cutting something with the shadow of a knife. It is not that this shadow constitutes a certain percentage of the sharpness of the knife. Even when this percentage is arbitrarily small this will still reach the knife's sharpness at one point in time. But in this case the shadow is even less than any arbitrary number. In the same way this goes for the sacrifice of animals. It cannot clean a person, not even for a single second, even if the person never sinned again. It is not a matter of quality or quantity, **it is impossible** because it is on a different level. One could even try to compare the shadow as a two-dimensional object trying to fill in a three-dimensional shape, but even this example would not suffice to show the impossibility of making offers for sin. For the two-dimensional shape has an infinitesimal thickness, but taking the integral would still result in the three-dimensional shape. The offers, on the other hand, are on a *completely* different kind of level. 

> **4** For it is aimpossible for the bblood of bulls and goats to take away sins. **5** Therefore, awhen He comes into the world, He says,   
> 	“bSACRIFICE AND OFFERING YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED,   
> 	BUT cA BODY YOU HAVE PREPARED FOR ME;  
> **6** 	aIN BURNT OFFERINGS AND*sacrifices* FOR SIN YOU HAVE TAKEN NO PLEASURE.  
> **7** 	“aTHEN I SAID, ‘BEHOLD, I HAVE COME,   
> 	IN bTHE SCROLL OF THE BOOK IT IS WRITTEN OF ME,   
> 	TO DO YOUR WILL, O GOD.’”  
>   
> **Heb. 10:8**   After saying above, “aSACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS AND bBURNT OFFERINGS AND*sacrifices*cFOR SIN YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, NOR HAVE YOU TAKEN PLEASURE*in them*” (which are offered according to the Law), **9** then He 1said, “aBEHOLD, I HAVE COME TO DO YOUR WILL.” He takes away the first in order to establish the second.  

God does not take pleasure in **burnt offerings and sacrifices**. These offers are only symbolically carried out to appease God *temporarily*—and God is not appeased with the offer itself, but with the heart that people have. 
Jesus is the One Whom this quote from Psalm 37 #todo/opzoeken/reference refers to, even though it is David who wrote this. What other reason would **Your will** refer to but that Jesus replaces these offerings? Since these offerings could not fulfill God's wrath, it was only an offer as great as Jesus that could fulfill it. 
As an example, in the movie #tags/movies *Beauty and the Beast* Belle replaced her father's place in prison, and this pleased the beast, otherwise he would not have accepted it. However, he did not have a rage towards this man, but a longing to be accepted and loved again (and he was not loved by Belle's father but feared in bad way) and so he accepts Belle in order to show her love and be loved by her. 
This beast cannot be compared to God, for God *does* have a rage towards man for they insulted God, cheated on Him and killed His prophets. He *does* want to kill all of humanity (although He does not take pleasure in it #todo/opzoeken/reference. However, somewhere in the Bible it said that it pleased Him to kill man.) and wants to see blood. Only an offer as great as the shedding of innocent blood, through the death of His Son, was sufficient to calm His wrath. There is an example of this where a man (perhaps a criminal) is ready to kill a whole town, but instead kills only one innocent victim, usually a child. First of all because the blood of this victim is worth more than the blood of all these adults, but second of all because the pain the town feels for the death of this child is what this man wants the people to feel, because that will be their suffering. #todo/nogaftemaken 
The latter illustration makes God's sacrifice even greater, for God is now appeased after shedding His Son' blood, but there is no mourning of the multitude who has now lost their innocent prophet, healer and teacher. In Jerusalem a great multitude praised Jesus and mourned Him indeed, including the disciples (Footnote: Some will say that a great multitude in Jerusalem praised Him but that these same people later shouted "Crucify Him!". However, this is not true. Archeological evidence has shown that the place where Jesus was tried was first in the wall, accessible through a small gate in the western part of the wall of Herod's palace (through which Herod could escape at any time) on a platform accessible by stairs. #todo  plaatje toevoegen. Outside of these walls there was a platform, where Jesus was tried again, and that's the place where people shouted "Crucify Him", of which some parts are still visible. Moreover, it is the exact same spot where a few years ago a lamb was sacrificed #todo/opzoeken  #todo/nogaftemaken by priests, even though it was the government that selected the place. The priests did not know about the place beforehand nor about the significance of the place. It were the leaders of the synagogue who took people who were on their side, or had bribed people, to set the mood, but it was not the multitude that followed Jesus and who believed in Jesus as the Messiah. These were kept in the dark and did not know anything about the trial of Jesus until later, otherwise they would possibly have rebelled.)—but excluding the Scribes, Pharisees and priests—but the greater multitude all of Israel and in the rest of the world did not mourn His death at all. It was the Father Who mourned Him most of all. 

> **10** By 1this will we have been asanctified through bthe offering of cthe body of Jesus Christ donce for all.  
>   
> **Heb. 10:11**   And every priest stands daily ministering and aoffering time after time the same sacrifices, which bcan never take away sins; **12** but He, having offered one sacrifice afor 1sins bfor all time, cSAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD, **13** waiting from that time aUNTIL HIS ENEMIES ARE PUT AS A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET. **14** For by one offering He has aperfected bfor all time those who are being sanctified. **15** And athe Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,  
> **16** 	“aTHIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM   
> 	AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE 1LORD:   
> 	I WILL PUT MY LAWS UPON THEIR HEART,   
> 	AND ON THEIR MIND I WILL WRITE THEM,”   
>   
>  *He then says*,  
> **17** 	“aAND THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS   
> 	I WILL REMEMBER NO MORE.”  
>   
> **Heb. 10:18**   Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer*any* offering for sin.  

Can forgiveness take away sin? No, that is not what it says. It says that **there is no longer any offering for sin**. There still is penance for sin, but this penance is not dealt  with by *offerings* anymore, because offerings are done by humans to symbolically substitute for the penance, but Jesus pays for our penance, not by means of symbols, but He has paid the price in full and experienced the pain which we would have experienced if we had not accepted Him.  


## A New and Living Way
> **Heb. 10:19**   Therefore, brothers, since we ahave confidence to benter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, **20** by aa new and living way which He inaugurated for us through bthe veil, that is, His flesh,   
 
His flesh is a symbol for the **living way**, not an appositive for the veil.

> **21** and since *we have*aa great priest bover the house of God, **22** let us adraw near with a 1sincere heart in bfull assurance of faith, having our hearts csprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies dwashed with pure water. **23** Let us hold fast the aconfession of our bhope without wavering, for cHe who promised is faithful. **24** And let us consider how ato stimulate one another to love and bgood deeds, **25** ::not forsaking our own aassembling together::, as is the habit of some, but bencouraging*one another*, and all the more as you see cthe day drawing near.  

It was because of **love and good deeds**that some were **forsaking [the] aassembling together**. This is a matter of all ages. Recently this verse has been cited very often, in the context of COVID-19 #tags/historic events/corona#when people did not go to church in order to protect themselves and—supposedly—others as well. It has always been a command not to forsake the assembly; it was never mentioned because this was purely logic. When the Hebrews still followed the Judaistic Law they went to the synagogue or temple every week. I cannot imagine any other religious Jew not doing so. It is *only in this situation*, where Christians thought so high of love and good deeds, that they thought these were higher goals than the assembly. But it is not—not back then and not now, regardless of what contragious disease there is. 

> Warning Against Willful Sin  
> **Heb. 10:26**   For if we go on asinning willfully after receiving bthe knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, **27** but a terrifying expectation of ajudgment and bTHE FURY OF A FIRE WHICH WILL CONSUME THE ADVERSARIES. **28** aAnyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy by *the mouth of* two or three witnesses. **29** aHow much worse punishment do you think he will deserve bwho has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has regarded as defiled cthe blood of the covenant dby which he was sanctified, and has einsulted the Spirit of grace? **30** For we know Him who said, “aVENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY.” And again, “bTHE 1LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE.” **31** It is a aterrifying thing to fall into the hands of the bliving God.  
>   
> **Heb. 10:32**   But remember athe former days, 1when, after being benlightened, you endured a great cconflict of sufferings, **33** partly by being amade a public spectacle through reproaches and afflictions, and partly by becoming bsharers with those who were so treated. **34** For you also ashowed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted with bjoy the seizure of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves ca better and lasting possession. **35** Therefore, do not throw away that aconfidence of yours, which has a great breward. **36** For you have need of aendurance, so that when you have bdone the will of God, you may creceive the promise.  
> **37** 	aFOR YET IN A VERY LITTLE WHILE,   
> 	bHE WHO IS COMING WILL COME, AND WILL NOT DELAY.  
> **38** 	aBUT MY RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL LIVE BY FAITH,   
> 	AND IF HE SHRINKS BACK, MY SOUL HAS NO PLEASURE IN HIM.  
>   
> **Heb. 10:39**   But 1we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the 2preserving of the soul.
