# Hebrews 8 (LSB)
**Jesus, High Priest of a New Covenant**
1Now the main point in what is being said *is this*: we have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, 2a minister in the holy places and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man. 3For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this *high priest* also have something to offer.

Why does it say "have" here and not "has", because a high priest is singular? The word "high priest" is slanted, which means that this has been added. #biblestudy/questions/rootwords
Jesus Christ is a high priest but not serving here on earth, but in heaven. He is a **minister [...] in the true tabernacle**, so not the tent which Moses pitched through his people, but **which the Lord pitched**. Of everything on earth there is a true substance in heaven or on the New Earth. The tabernacle and everything belonging to the Levitical priesthood are merely **a copy and shadow of the heavenly things**. Jesus would not serve in the Temple in Jerusalem, but He would rather serve in the real Temple, which is our body, right now (1 Corinthians 6 #todo/opzoeken/reference  ) and on the New Earth there will be no temple anymore because no sacrifice will be needed anymore #todo/opzoeken  cf. Revelation. 

4Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law; 5who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned *by God* when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, “See,” He says, “that you make all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain.”

Even though the tabernacle—and the temple as well were only copies and shadows, still **Moses was warned [to] make all things according to the pattern**. A shadow is a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional object. This does not necessarily need to be two dimensions, but it is always one dimension less than the original substance. However, the word "shadow" is merely defined by man, for in this case the real temple will probably consist of at least two extra dimensions, for in Heaven and on the New Earth we will live outside of the dimensions of space and time, just like Jesus can move freely through space (when He traveled between in places far away from each other within split seconds) and time (for the ancient prophets Moses and Elijah knew Him, as well as Abraham).

6But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises. 7For if that first *covenant* had been faultless, there would have been no occasion sought for a second. 

This paragraph does not indicate that Jesus used to have a *less* excellent ministry, but *compared to the Levitical priests* he has a **a more excellent ministry**. 

How could the first covenant contain faults if it was created by God Who does not make mistakes? The difference between a fault and a mistake is that a mistake is made when one could have done something better and did not know or do so at the time. A fault however does not necessarily encompass these conditions. A fault can be the result of a mistake, but it could also be because there was no other way. 
God does not make mistakes and He always chooses or creates the best option there is. 
In His covenant with Abraham there was no perfect lamb that took away all sins, so that no animal sacrifice would ever be needed. Could God have mercy on let Jesus be born in Abraham's time? 

God wanted Jesus to die in Jerusalem. He wanted His people to live in that land. He wanted His people, the Israelites, to experience *the need* for a Savior and to expect an oncoming Messiah. 
The first thing could not take place because the Ammonites were living in Israel at that time and God's measure was not full yet #todo/opzoeken/reference. Only after this had happened, all the events mentioned above could take place. 

Everything God has done in history has its purpose (cf. Isaiah 14:24,27) and to everything there is a time and place (cf. Ecclesiastes 3:1ff). 
The best possible covenant God could make with Abraham was the one He had made and which we know of. 

8For finding fault with them, He says,
“Behold, days are coming, says the Lord,
When I will complete a new covenant
With the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;
9Not like the covenant which I made with their fathers
In the day when I took them by the hand
To lead them out of the land of Egypt;
For they did not continue in My covenant,
And I did not care for them, says the Lord.

In other words, God completed a new covenant with both houses. Now we know that there is only one house of God for God only has one family, but on Earth there are two houses. Together though, they form God's house. The question, however, is whether this new covenant is made with the house of Israel as in the northern tribes, or with both Judah and Israel. In the context of Jeremiah 31:31ff where this is quoted from, this seems to be the house of Israel only, as if a different covenant with Judah will be described in a further passage. But here this covenant seems to be for everyone, including even Christians. That is perhaps because we are reading this in our time and because this letter is in the New Testament. The receivers of this letter, however, interpreted this as a promise to them. But if this promise were only with the house of Israel, then this would only apply to part of the listeners—*if* they even knew what their heritage was, for many had lost their heritage (cf. #todo/opzoeken/reference Ezra/Nehemiah where some wanted to be priests but could not prove it), other were mingled with other tribes and some even with heathen people, especially those from Babylonia and Persia. This passage would not have been a strong argument then. So it is clear that the Jews who received this letter understood this passage to be for them, and that the **house of Israel** in v.10 refers to God's house. 

10“For this is the covenant that Iwill make with the house of Israel
After those days, says the Lord:

We see that it says **After those days**. We need to keep in mind that it is a covenant with the **house of Israel** that is being established here. But what does the *after* mean? It probably means that in the end times after the days of the Great Tribulation God will establish a new covenant with the  ... #todo/nogaftemaken  

Unbelievers who have turned to Jesus and everyone who have accepted Jesus and confess that Jesus is the Son of God, and Who has come into the flesh (1 John 4). Now. This does not sound like a great revelation, it had rather been a greater revelation if God had said that none of us should teach any one at all because everyone knows Jesus whether they are Christian or not. But this not what God says here. The author of Hebrews says on behalf of God, that no one shall teach another person about Jesus. Because we shall all know him, but we are already in the house of God—the house of Israel. So, why is it then even relevant to say something like this?

The answer is, of course, that right now, those who are in the house of God, whether it's the Jews or the Christians, or those people, who think they are in the house of God—they all still need to be taught. Rabbis are still teaching their disciples and these disciples teach other people. Even we, Christians, are teaching other Christians about God. We have dozens or thousands of theological seminaries and teaching is still needed, but there will be a time that people in the house of Israel will not need any teaching *at all* because they will know God and His will.

So we know there is a promise that all will know God, and every knee will bow for him and all every tongue will confess it and Jesus is Lord (Philippians 2:15 #todo/opzoeken/reference ) but that promise Is not the same promise as this promise here because that promise goes for everyone and everyone who knows Christ confess that Jesus is the Christ. Jesus is the son of God, but it's not a confession that they actually are committed to gift their last to them and they will bow their knees. But only because they have to because they admit and realize that he is God. This is only for Christians because it is only for those to whom Christ and God are merciful.


I will put My laws into their minds,
And upon their hearts I will write them.
And I will be their God,
And they shall be My people.
11“And they shall not teach everyone his fellow citizen,
And everyone his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’
For all will know Me,
From the least to the greatest of them.
12“For I will be merciful to their iniquities,
And I will remember their sins no more.”
13 When He said, “A new *covenant*,” He has made the first ::obsolete::. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to disappear.

Now, there is another part here that says **obsolete**. The old covenant will become obsolete. But what we'll also have is that thing that becomes absolutely will be and there's a word for that will be destroyed will be removed or something. And those are two different words. It is not that as soon as something becomes obsolete automatically is gone no because you just don't use it anymore but it does mean that you can't throw it away because you don't use it anymore.

So we need to realize that these two things happen in two phases or this thing happens in two phases. And so the old law Is still. It's not working anymore. It's obsolete, but it's being used by Jews and by even people who call themselves Christians, but who are actually working for their faith.

Perhaps even Jehovah's Witnesses. I'm not really sure about that. But within reform churches, there are so many people who are actually working for their faith working for their salvation. I mean, And it could be in the hyper-calvinistic corner where people want to be saved. What? They don't know, whether they are elected.

So they work hard in order to be elected, it could be in the Armenian corner or people work hard in order to be saved at the end of their lives because they will never be safe. You know, they will never have certainty of being saved and continuing of being saved.

They might be saved by God, but they can also lose their salvation. So that's why the work of heart in order to keep it. And then there's also the other side which is not the hypercalvinistic side but the hyper grace side, maybe I should rephrase it differently but hyper grace often goes together with the prosperity theory.

And they might seem different doctrines. They might seem like hyper gray, so you don't have to work and all anymore. You'd only have to believe and they can sin whatever you want, because you're still going to get grace. And with prosperity, you're going not only going to get crazier also, going to get prosper and in a material sense.

But it actually still is work because it is saying that if you do not prosper, if you don't get this material welfare, it means because you it means that you don't have enough faith. So it depends on you. You need to have more faith and whatever you do. You need to work in some way in order to get more faith.

So it's still Your faith based on works or it's a salvation based on works or something like that. And in the same way, they would also say that the material things you get based on your faith, which depends on how much effort in.

They might say the same thing about salvation, right? So not the material welfare, but the spiritual welfare, you probably get that through faith as well. And if you don't have enough faith, you don't have that.
