# Isaiah 33
#biblestudy/devotionals/isaiah 

**Distress and Help**
*1 Woe to you, destroyer,*
*you who have not been destroyed!*
*Woe to you, betrayer,*
*you who have not been betrayed!*
*When you stop destroying,*
*you will be destroyed;*
*when you stop betraying,*
*you will be betrayed.*

At one time the backlash will come at those who destroy the lives of others. Though this is most likely literally about Assyria, it is figuratively about all nations, and perhaps people as well, who show this destructive behavior. 
Of course a destroyer has not been destroyed at the time he is still destroying. Otherwise he would not be able to destroy, unless it was a long time ago in the past, such as with Egypt. Babylon itself was destroyed as well, but that too was of a different era. This verse does so much mean that as soon as you stop destroying, then destruction will come upon you—for then the destroyer would think of never stopping to destroy countries—but rather that one day he cannot destroy anymore. He will run out of people in his army, out of money and other resources. He will even lose goodwill. 
These things will happen to those who destroy. They will be destroyed, their country will be destroyed, and they will be betrayed. In the case of Sennacherib, all of these things happened to him. His people and his own armies rebelled against him and he could not subdue the Babylonians. He was betrayed and killed by his own son. His country, though ruled by his son, would survive no longer.
Unlike Israel, where David too was betrayed by his sons who wanted to kill him, but instead both of his sons died. The army commander and priest who were against him died, though during the reign of his other son, Solomon. And his fourth son, who tried to grasp the throne even before David had died, had to pay with his life for that, eventually, when doing that again during Solomon's reign. 
But David's kingdom, or rather, God's kingdom of Israel remained, because Israel did not betray and destroy other countries, but mostly because God intervened. 

#todo/opzoeken  Did Solomon kill him or banish him? The same question for that guy who mocked David. 

*2 Lord, be gracious to us;*
*we long for you.*
*Be our strength every morning,*
*our salvation in time of distress.*
*3 At the uproar of your army, the peoples flee;*
*when you rise up, the nations scatter.*
*4 Your plunder, O nations, is harvested as by young locusts;*
*like a swarm of locusts people pounce on it.*

Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I long for You. I long for You every morning. Every day I wait for you to I hear Your voice and I call out to You to hear my voice. I call out to You in my heart and with my voice, with my writings and in my thoughts. In my actions I hope You can see them, so You will know that all I do is for You. 
Forgive me if my intentions are wrong or if there is selfishness in my actions. I am following Your commands and I know I am not pure in my heart. I can never be as pure as You are, Jesus, fully giving up Yourself for others, loving others like Yourself and even more than that. Trusting Your Father completely, so much that You would not even be afraid to jump off a cliff, for Your faith is do great that it is not merely faith, but it is knowing. 
Rescue me from the temptations in my heart for I cannot do it alone. I need Your strength for that. Your help and Your comfort for when I sin. You alone can help me. Everyone else can only give tips and tricks which do not treat the core problem. 
You are my Provider, my kinsman Redeemer. Cover me with your wings, O Lord, and keep the enemy away from me. 

I know I have destroyed and betrayed, and one day it might be my turn to be destroyed and betrayed. Perhaps by my own son or my wife. It would all be part of righteousness. There is nothing I can do about that, but if you are willing and granting me this grace, then you can let this punishment be taken away from me. 
I must keep my end of the covenant. Please help me in keeping this, in not destroying the lives of others and betraying others. I need Your help for that. 

*5 The Lord is exalted, for he dwells on high;*
*he will fill Zion with his justice and righteousness.*

The Lord is on a whole other level than we are. He is literally exalted, *literally* is figuratively here, for in God's world there are no dimensions, but He still is "higher" than we are, in any aspect. The Lord dwells above us and does not mingle in our conversations and discussions about religion. He is too good to intermingle with those talks, for He already knows what is true and what is not. And even more, what He says *is* true, by definition. So if he says that all apples are red, they will spontaneously become red, because what God says, is is always the truth, so that either the apples immediately change in color or the definition of red expands to include green ones as well.

*6 He will be the sure foundation for your times,*
*a rich store of salvation and wisdom and knowledge;*
*the fear of the Lord is the key to this treasure.*

In these times who has a sure foundation? There are people who depend on money. Even if they think they are safe, because they have invested in diverse and low-risk portfolios, or even in other non-conventional currencies such as cryptocurrencies, precious metals and jewelry, still—are all not merely man-made [kostbaarheden] #todo/opzoeken ?
What decides the value of gold? Only the demand and what you can trade it for. If people do not trade their food with you for gold, then what is all your worth to you? If food is all we have left, and scarcity thereof, then your foundation will crumble below you. 
Even all of your good works, which are precious stones and metals, with which you build *on* the foundation, will flush away with the storm. They can withstand fire, but without a foundation they are worth nothing. 
The Lord Himself is the sure foundation in these times—*these* being all times, for this is applicable for every person in every age. He possesses the knowledge and wisdom needed to live a fruitful life. He provides salvation from hell and from what is awful in this world. The key to obtaining this treasure is the fear of the Lord. 

*7 Look, their brave men cry aloud in the streets;*
*the envoys of peace weep bitterly.*
*8 The highways are deserted,*
*no travelers are on the roads.*
*The treaty is broken,*
*its witnesses are despised,*
*no one is respected.*
*9 The land dries up and wastes away,*
*Lebanon is ashamed and withers;*
*Sharon is like the Arabah,*
*and Bashan and Carmel drop their leaves.*

One day, even the greatest powers of the world, then being Assyria, but applicable to Babylon and Persia as well, and now being the United States, Russia perhaps and China, will weep bitterly about everything they *thought* they had accomplished. 
Though treaties are different in this world than back then, there are peace and economic treaties from which both countries will benefit. Without these treaties they will waste away. China is nothing more than a huge land with a huge number of people, built on an economic bubble of prosperity and a social bubble of hope of a better life. When these bubbles burst life in the city will become like that of Rio de Janeiro, with most of the people living on the streets, on lower ground areas, in [krottenwijken] #todo/opzoeken  ghettos. Not ghettos that are temporarily [gedoogd] allowed, but permanent ones, because the government does not know how to deal with these. 
But Rio is only a peace of cake [schijntje] #todo/opzoeken  compared to what will happen to cities like Beijing and Luoyang, with 20 million people or more. Even New Delhi and Mumbai cannot compare to the size of these Chinese cities. Calcutta comes close as for poverty and unhygienic situations, but people still survive there and multiply. What will happen with the even larger and chaotic metropolitans will not be multiplication. It will be starvation. 
A huge economic and logistic system needs to be up and running in order to maintain these cities. Without these, people will not eat, drink, and die of starvation or diseases quickly. 
As for Russia, the weather alone is capable of killing the whole nation in winter, without sufficient fuel to keep the people warm. 
America is less crowded and has less problems with the weather, but the problems there will arise on another field. As mentioned many times before, the Left is influencing the country in such a way even 7-year olds are taught what different gender identities there are, stimulating gender dysphoria. Adding up all other wrong teachings about sex, these too will not lead to multiplication, as normally would happen with normal (married) couples having sex, but this will lead—as even predicted by a manga series—to infertility. 
The usage of pills and other hormones to prevent conception could lead to genetic (i.e. inheritable) disturbances, puberty blockers even more say—and what shall we say of homosexual activities? Aside from STDs—though not yet proven—it is highly likely that these activities will lead to some form of infertility. 
It is known for example that women under duress and stress cannot conceive or will miscarry in the first months. Psychosomatic problems are real and people with these problems will sooner or later see the symptoms in their fertility. 
So summarizing, a large part of women will become infertile due to hormone usage. A larger part of people will become transgender or homosexual and by definition not conceive. A larger part of people will be confused about their gender identity and through psychosomatic problems incur problems with their fertility. This all leads to the population shrinking which is disastrous for the American economy, which in a not small scale leans on the incomes incurred through social security—a Ponzi scheme, which is doomed to fail when the number of attenders shrinks. 

*10 “Now will I arise, ” says the Lord.*
*“Now will I be exalted;*
*now will I be lifted up.*

But God will arise. He will not let it end that way. No, that would be too easy. That would take too long as well. God is patient, but He will not let His people suffer any longer than necessary. 
God needs a place in time where He can arise, where He will be exalted, where people will recognize Him, that *they* were wrong and lift up God for all *He* has done.

*11 You conceive chaff,*
*you give birth to straw;*
*your breath is a fire that consumes you.*
*12 The peoples will be burned to ashes;*
*like cut thornbushes they will be set ablaze. ”*

The goal of the wicked, the Assyrians, is to set fire and to destroy everything. Even if it does not burn, they will add chaff and straw to make it burn. Every breath they take consists of fire, which means that everything they do is destructive.

*13 You who are far away, hear what I have done;*
*you who are near, acknowledge my power!*
*14 The sinners in Zion are terrified;*
*trembling grips the godless:*
*“Who of us can dwell with the consuming fire?*
*Who of us can dwell with everlasting burning?”*

But those who trust in the Lord will be saved. They will realize God's power. The realization thereof, however, can be terrifying or relieving. For the sinner this will be the former. They will tremble out of fear. Even if they are not afraid of death, they will be afraid of God, for His fire is everlasting and will continue to burn even after death. 

*15 Those who walk righteously*
*and speak what is right,*
*who reject gain from extortion*
*and keep their hands from accepting bribes,*
*who stop their ears against plots of murder*
*and shut their eyes against contemplating evil—*
*16 they are the ones who will dwell on the heights,*
*whose refuge will be the mountain fortress.*
*Their bread will be supplied,*
*and water will not fail them.*

The righteous will not overcome the same fate. They will stay above the deeds of the evildoers and this in itself will be their refuge. This might sound strange, because that does not seem like a reward. One could say, *because I have lived a good life, I do not get to die by the hands of my enemies, but I will get a place in a refuge*, the refuge being another safe place. In that case there really is a difference in the consequence of the two different ways of living.
But if the consequence of living righteous is that you have a righteous life, and *that* is your refuge, what then is your reward? *If* that were the case, the righteous life in itself is enough reward. 
It is hard to explain, but compare it to healthy eating. You do your best to eat healthy and in the end you *do* get a reward, with a longer life—or at least in most cases—and a healthier body with which you can still be active and not out of breath after a few walks. But even if these rewards were not present, what was then your reward? The reward is that you are on a higher level. The food you have eaten was better and tastier—though fast food may *seem* tastier through MSGs and other artificial flavorings. But you are on a higher level, that in itself is your reward and because of this level you will get a higher reward. 
In the case of righteousness, you will have peace of mind, no regrets, for what you have done was right in the eyes of the Lord. 

*17 Your eyes will see the king in his beauty*
*and view a land that stretches afar.*

Moses had the honor of seeing the land of Canaan, but not the honor touching it with his feet. How blessed are the feet of those to touch the holy ground, for they will know they are walking on the ground the great men of God walked upon, thousands of years of ago, among which the greatest man of all time, Jesus Christ. 
Being able to see a king in real life, is an honor to many. Even in the small country of the Netherlands, it is an honor to see the Dutch king or even the Queen Mother. In China as well the former "president"—though he is ironically called "chairman" in order to distinguish the communist "social" leaders from the capitalist "hierarchical" leaders, although the communist leaders are much more dictatorial (such as Castro, Lenin and Mao, all these up until now) than capitalist ones—is still being driven in diplomatic cars, where whole streets are blocked when he merely drives by. 
What an honor would it then be not to see the king or president of a country, not even that of a continent, or of the whole planet (such as Empress ..., who was the leader of a whole planet, mother or princess Leia)—not even that of the universe as known by man, such as Darth Vader or Palpaton, #todo/opzoeken but that of the whole world and everything outside of it? 
What an honor would it be to not only see Him, but to be able to talk to him as well, directly, at any time we want. Even more, He speaks to us and He knows our hearts. Even closer than our own parents or siblings He is, because He is our Creator and He knows everything about us, our past and our future. 

*18 In your thoughts you will ponder the former terror:*
*“Where is that chief officer?*
*Where is the one who took the revenue?*
*Where is the officer in charge of the towers? ”*
*19 You will see those arrogant people no more,*
*people whose speech is obscure,*
*whose language is strange and incomprehensible.*

What a relief it is to be thinking about things in the past tense, to know that things have been long since. Verse 18 could even be interpreted in a mocking way, as in "*Where is this officer now? He is not saying anything anymore.*" 
The good news, we will see these people no more. They have received their punishment. Justice has prevailed [geschieden #todo/opzoeken ] 

*20 Look on Zion, the city of our festivals;*
*your eyes will see Jerusalem,*
*a peaceful abode, a tent that will not be moved;*
*its stakes will never be pulled up,*
*nor any of its ropes broken.*
*21 There the Lord will be our Mighty One.*
*It will be like a place of broad rivers and streams.*
*No galley with oars will ride them,*
*no mighty ship will sail them.*

Naaman [the prophet? #todo/opzoeken ] was proud of the mighty rivers of his country, but these rivers would soon be empty. What is the use then of mighty rivers if one does not have ships or galleys to sail them? 
But Jerusalem will be mighty in other ways. It will be peaceful, which is one thing many a country cannot boast about; it will not be moved, unlike "mighty" cities like Babylon which have been conquered many times, perhaps renamed and re-inhabited as well, Jerusalem was inhabited by the Israelites. 
Unfortunately this was only temporary, because the Israelites did not hold up their end. God did though, and eventually, after the Israelites lost the city in approximately 70 AD, due to their disobedience and not coincidentally after killing their own Savior and Messiah, Jesus Christ, God returned it to them in 1945. 

*22 For the Lord is our judge,*
*the Lord is our lawgiver,*
*the Lord is our king;*
*it is he who will save us.*

Jerusalem will be like a wide plain of water, perfectly calm and peaceful. No enemies will come, because they will be seen from many miles away. No enemies will comes, because they know that God, our King, is the ruler of this city.
God is the Judge here, He makes the laws, He executes them, He rules over the people and He saves us. He is policy, military, government, justice and lawmaker all at once. No wonder, for everything came out of Him, as said in 1 Corinthians 4? #todo/opzoeken 
> For everything, absolutely everything, was created by Him and for His purpose.   

There is not *trias politicas* in Him, for that only exists because man is trustworthy enough to have that much power and responsibility. But God is worthy and reliable. He deserves our faith and our full trust.

*23 Your rigging hangs loose:*
*The mast is not held secure,*
*the sail is not spread.*
*Then an abundance of spoils will be divided*
*and even the lame will carry off plunder.*
*24 No one living in Zion will say, “I am ill”;*
*and the sins of those who dwell there will be forgiven.*

The ships of the enemies will look like badly maintained ones, which can be conquered even by the lame. The bad will descend this much in their status that even the lame will look like the powerful. 
The big differences there are in this world right now, are because the wicked are upheld by status and money. But without these they would be much lower than the rest of the people. 
If we exclude all these factors and analyze how worthy people are on a moral scale, for example, then the lame are probably far above the rich and—by definition—above the wicked. The lame have their humility which often brings along a good deal of mercy towards others. This is what God desires and ultimately what God desires, is what matters. 
However, it is because this world measures with another scale that includes esthetics, outer appearances, education and wealth as well, and attaching a very low weight to morality,  that the even allows the wicked to rise to the top. The world has put these things in reverse order. 
Just like everything in evolution is in reversed order—e.g. out of death, came life, while the Bible says out of life, Adam, came death through sin—so the world values it all in reversed order as well. Humility, morality—which includes righteousness and justice—wisdom, goodness, kindness and all other characteristics of the fruit of the Holy Spirit, and *then only* intelligence, beauty and physical strength come in God's eyes. I might be wrong about the exact order and I must have skipped a few important ones, but in general it is the inner traits that are more important to God than the outer traits. 
God gave some of the men and women in the Bible outer traits, such as beauty to Esther, wisdom to Solomon and strength to Simson, but He judged them upon the usage thereof by their inner traits. Esther used her courage, Simson did not use his wisdom and discipline to stay away from what he wanted (the sweetness of honey and the seduction of women), and Solomon did not use his wisdom for his own life—God judged them all by their inner traits. 

I pray to You, O Lord Jesus, for You are my Creator. You have created my inner being and my outer parts. You have made me whole and given me a purpose. The purpose of the body and mind I have right now, was given by You and made to worship You alone. Yet you are gracious enough to let me and others enjoy these gifts as well. 
I thank You that I may praise you with this imperfect body, which is far from fully sanctified, sacred and dedicated to You, which still needs a lot of loitering #todo/opzoeken  louteren, and branches that need to be cut off. I still need to be molded in that shape and be dried up in order not to jump back into my old shape, which I am so inclined to do. 
I ask You that You watch over me and instruct me in the way of living the life You want for me. Give me the wisdom to be a good child of Yours, a good husband and a good father, just like You are a husband of Your Church and a Father to Your people. 
Let me be a good brother and friend to those around me; a brother to my fellow Christians and to Your people, the Israelites, and a friend to those who do not yet know You, through Celebrate Recovery and other initiatives for missionary work, whether in the Netherlands or somewhere else in the world. 
Send me out, Lord, to where You want me to be. Open doors in my life and give me wisdom to know whether I should walk through these doors and to which door.

I pray that You protect those around me from evil and protect me from any temptation of my former life. I have died with Christ and You live within me. Let any temptation of pornography, materialism, and any addictions to adrenaline and excitement, be it through books, movies, series or comics, be far away from me. Lead me in living a holy life such as some of my brothers are doing, but let me not be isolated among Christians at the same time, so that the light You have put in me will be used and have a good place to shine.

I ask You this in the precious Name of Your Son, Jesus Christ. 
Amen.
