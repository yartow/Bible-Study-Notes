*Isaiah 4:6 - 5:30 (NIV)*
**The Song of the Vineyard**
*1 I will sing for the one I love*
*a song about his vineyard:*
*My loved one had a vineyard*
*on a fertile hillside.*
*2 He dug it up and cleared it of stones*
*and planted it with the choicest vines.*
*He built a watchtower in it*
*and cut out a winepress as well.*
*Then he looked for a crop of good grapes,*
*but it yielded only bad fruit.*
*3 “Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and people of Judah,*
*judge between me and my vineyard.*
*4 What more could have been done for my vineyard*
*than I have done for it?*
*When I looked for good grapes,*
*why did it yield only bad?*

Considering normal circumstances, there is nothing one can do to make a vine grow better. The soil is fertile, the vines are choice, the land is clear of stones, what else can be done? 
The same is true for Israel. Their land is fertile and is a piece of land that is fought much over, because it is the only fertile piece of land in the whole Middle East, it seems, except for the Nile Delta. The people are among the smartest in the world. Though I am not aware of any inventions before or during the classical period, but in the modern age the Jewish people have attributed for many of the Nobel Prizes and scientific achievements.
The people are also, at least in my opinion, one of the most beautiful people, even with mixtures from all over the world. 
The Jewish Law is the most perfect of all countries. It is revolutionary on the field of slavery and abolishes the form as it was back then, it is against racism, it attributes more rights to women than any other religion or culture and women put next to men, not beneath them in value. It is a religion where God is worshipped with peace and love as a consequence. The Law makes sure people are healthy and do not have STD's and as a consequence, the Jews were most probably the healthiest people on Earth. 
What more could God have given them? What made the Jew jealous of other peoples with other gods? It was not anything good they wanted, for the best was already within their own country and with their own god, but it was something bad. Something they could not get from their own god, because God would not give anything bad to His own children. 

*5 Now I will tell you*
*what I am going to do to my vineyard:*
*I will take away its hedge,*
*and it will be destroyed;*
*I will break down its wall,*
*and it will be trampled.*
*6 I will make it a wasteland,*
*neither pruned nor cultivated,*
*and briers and thorns will grow there.*
*I will command the clouds*
*not to rain on it.”*

The only way to get the bad out of it is to start afresh, by taking away all of its protection and burning it down, not even letting rain fall on it. Perhaps this could kill the bacteria, viruses and other plagues in the vines, for even these need water.
This was not a one-time punishment, this happened again and again until the Messiah came. 

*7 The vineyard of the Lord Almighty*
*is the nation of Israel,*
*and the people of Judah*
*are the vines he delighted in.*
*And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed;*
*for righteousness, but heard cries of distress.*

The Israelites had everything they *needed* but they *wanted* more. Their greed and lust was bigger than their love for their fellowmen as will be clearly shown in the six woes in the next part. It was because of this greed that there was no justice and righteousness in Israel and Judah. 

**Woes and Judgments**

*8 Woe to you who add house to house*
*and join field to field*
*till no space is left*
*and you live alone in the land.*
*9 The Lord Almighty has declared in my hearing:*
*“Surely the great houses will become desolate,*
*the fine mansions left without occupants.*
*10 A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine;*
*a homer of seed will yield only an ephah of grain.”*

The first woe is for real estate owners, those who buy more and more houses and leave them empty, while the number of people living on the streets are steadily increasing, all of this to increase the price. 
The Chinese are doing this right now and are raising the prices of housing on in the big cities, such as Hong Kong, Beijing and right now even in Amsterdam, and perhaps in other countries as well. 
Prices are soaring in these countries, and though the situation in the Netherlands is still fine, in Hong Kong and Beijing people have to live in a two-bedroom apartment with more than five people. 
Israel was punished for this by famine conditions in the produce of grapes and grain. 
China is punished for this as well, not in agricultural ways but most certainly in other ways. [which I cannot think of right now, but the situation in China is bothersome as it is right now. There is little freedom. The Chinese cannot leave their country without visa.] And if they are not punished right now, then this punishment will be due soon, because the Lord is One Who will not relent, even for a single sin. 
So this is punishment by famine. 

*Woe to those who rise early in the morning*
*to run after their drinks,*
*who stay up late at night*
*till they are inflamed with wine.*
*12 They have harps and lyres at their banquets,*
*pipes and timbrels and wine,*
*but they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord,*
*no respect for the work of his hands.*
*13 Therefore my people will go into exile*
*for lack of understanding;*
*those of high rank will die of hunger*
*and the common people will be parched with thirst.*
*14 Therefore Death expands its jaws,*
*opening wide its mouth;*
*into it will descend their nobles and masses*
*with all their brawlers and revelers.*
*15 So people will be brought low*
*and everyone humbled,*
*the eyes of the arrogant humbled.*
*16 But the Lord Almighty will be exalted by his justice,*
*and the holy God will be proved holy by his righteous acts.*
*17 Then sheep will graze as in their own pasture;*
*lambs will feed among the ruins of the rich.*

It seems like all of this is directed towards China, for in China (and Korea as well) drunkenness leads to new heights. Not only are they enjoying alcohol and women all night long, they are even forcing their employees to drink. 
Yes, it is usually the high ranks who have these exquisite banquets and throw away all of the leftovers, which are a lot, just to show how rich they are. It is for this reason that the rich will die first. 
Now the above from verse 13 on has happened before during the Communistic Revolution. This shows that God's warnings and promises are throughout all of history and will still be applicable for the future until the day Jesus returns. 

3. 
*18 Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit,*
*and wickedness as with cart ropes,*
*19 to those who say, “Let God hurry;*
*let him hasten his work*
*so we may see it.*
*The plan of the Holy One of Israel—*
*let it approach, let it come into view,*
*so we may know it.”*

In the current context, those who deceit and bring along sin, or actually the other way around, for they sin and use deceit to cover this up, but they use deceit as well in order to be able to sin more, are the Democrats. Dinesh D'Souza's new book, *the Big Lie*, but his previous ones as well, *Hillary's America* and *[forgot  the title]*, explain how the Democrats have always used politics in order to establish their own sinful worldview and to gain from it personally, principally and financially. In this way they set up Planned Parenthood in order to establish racist schemes, but killing many of the non-minority babies as well—which they do not care about, as long as black ones die. 
In doing that they are also undermining God's authority in *every* field. They want to rule the media, the press and the universities, in order to brainwash the people. Why would they care about posing evolution as the way the world was created? Because only then they can justify the killing of people, like Hitler did, who was a big fan of evolution and thought he was aiding it by getting rid of the weak (cf. the documentary *Darwin's legacy* presented by D. James Kennedy).

4. 
*20 Woe to those who call evil good*
*and good evil,*
*who put darkness for light*
*and light for darkness,*
*who put bitter for sweet*
*and sweet for bitter.*

In the way described above the Democrats are trading good for evil. What would sexuality have to do with their schemes? I do not know at this moment, except that it brings the people farther away from Christianity, which is good for them, because the less Christians, the more people will vote for the progressive side. In the same way they support gay marriages and everything else that is forbidden by God—or in other words, that makes God sad. 

5. 
*21 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes*
*and clever in their own sight.*

I almost do not dare to say anything about this, for I am one of those who is clever in his own sight. Fortunately, though, God's wisdom is so great and overwhelming that I have no other way but to acknowledge that He is greater than I in every field and therefore more clever, more wise and stronger. 
In the United States, at the moment of writing, but surely this was the case a few hundred years ago as well, people think they are smarter than God. I cannot but realize how dumb they are every time I think about it. They keep telling themselves there is no God and therefore they can do whatever they want to do, but what makes them feel guilty? They had rather not think about that, because they are afraid of facing their own fears, being that God really does exist and will punish them for everything they have done. 

6. 
*22 Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine*
*and champions at mixing drinks,*
*23 who acquit the guilty for a bribe,*
*but deny justice to the innocent.*
*24 Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up straw*
*and as dry grass sinks down in the flames,*
*so their roots will decay*
*and their flowers blow away like dust;*
*for they have rejected the law of the Lord Almighty*
*and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel.*

Corruption is the last woe. All of the above are reasons why a country can fail, not only in an economic sense, but fail in giving God glory as well. It is for this reason that God lets a country's economy fail and lets the forces of nature destroy the land as well. It is not the other way around, that is, that nature destroyed the land and therefore the economy failed. 
When God acts, he will make sure that the roots of these people disappear. Nothing of them and their families will be left over. Perhaps the Kennedy family was one of them, though they seemed like good people. God must have known what was in their hearts. It could not have been coincidence that all members held such high positions, there must have been some kind of corruption or bribery in place. 
Furthermore JFK was infamous for his many relations with women, how could he be morally sufficient to lead a country?
We do not know, we only that the Kennedy roots are gone. There still is a Rockefeller group, but their influence is decreasing. It might be increasing through the Bilderberg Group, but that is unknown to the many. 

*25 Therefore the Lord’s anger burns against his people;*
*his hand is raised and he strikes them down.*
*The mountains shake,*
*and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets.*
*Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away,*
*his hand is still upraised.*

The Lord has forgiven the people many times over, but every time they commit the same sin again of hurting by going after idols and inherently hurting other people, by unrighteous and immoral deeds, because any other god but God is by definition immoral and unrighteous. Why? Because all other gods are images of Satan and are meant for the destruction of this world. One might argue that other religions promote good as well. That is only partially and only in the symptoms. The Satan does this of course to disguise the inner bad, otherwise it would have no followers or it could be refuted too easily. 
In Buddhism one is called not to long for anything anymore, which—if it works—would indicate that man abandons all the beauty that God has given. Perhaps that would mean to refrain from sexual desires as well and prohibit the creation of offspring. Furthermore, women are denoted as lower and unclean beings, so in this society women would not thrive either. 
In Hinduism the caste system would inherently cause a lot of pain and sorrow. The caste system cannot be separated from Hinduism. 
In Islam peace is promoted, but it is not the same piece as Christians promote, for it is a piece that is obtained when everyone has become a Muslim. And even when that has happened, neglecting the differences between Sunnis and other types of Muslims, women again are in a disadvantageous situation. 
Why does the Satan not create religions that will kill people in a faster way? He already has, by creating sects such as the Falun Gong, Son of Sam and the [Peoples Temple ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples_Temple#Recruiting,_faith_healings,_and_fund_raising).
Another answer is that God does not allow the Satan to do such a thing too often. 

In short there is not one religion that promotes the good of people and their societal and moral progress—there is always a catch—and in doing so giving God glory—that is, they are giving the Satan glory in some way—except for the Judeo-Christian religions, and the Jewish one—including Jesus as Messiah—when properly understood and put in practice, is the same as the Christian one, for Jesus has not come to change a single iota in the Law, but only to fulfill it. 

*26 He lifts up a banner for the distant nations,*
*he whistles for those at the ends of the earth.*
*Here they come,*
*swiftly and speedily!*
*27 Not one of them grows tired or stumbles,*
*not one slumbers or sleeps;*
*not a belt is loosened at the waist,*
*not a sandal strap is broken.*
*28 Their arrows are sharp,*
*all their bows are strung;*
*their horses’ hooves seem like flint,*
*their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.*

That day has sadly come. For the Israelites it were two days, the first being the day the Assyrians came. Not only were the Jews deported, but I can imagine that many were killed and tortured for a long time before the they were killed. Stripped of their skin, soaked in salt, scalped alive and more gruesome deeds. 
The Babylonians might have been less worse and they might have deported more than they have slaughtered, but this I do not know for a fact. 
In this day there are distant nations who are coming, not to attack America with their forces, for America's army is the strongest of the world, but they have come with so-called humility. I am talking about refugees. They come with needs of food and work, they want to become Americans and bring richness to the culture by bringing in their own culture. 
But this is only a cover, for the Satan is planting his seeds in America through these refugees, for most of the refugees from the Middle East are Muslim, and he is making Americans become soft and give up their own constitutional and Christian values which are to protect American citizens first. 
Now jobs are taken by immigrants, among which many Mexicans, a lot of taxpayer's money is going to the funding of immigrants who do not work as well as to refugees. Aside from the argument to protect these refugees, which is morally correct, Americans can and should forbid that refugees import their religion for example. 

*29 Their roar is like that of the lion,*
*they roar like young lions;*
*they growl as they seize their prey*
*and carry it off with no one to rescue.*
*30 In that day they will roar over it*
*like the roaring of the sea.*
*And if one looks at the land,*
*there is only darkness and distress;*
*even the sun will be darkened by clouds.*

It will not be far before the Netherlands is in a state where only darkness can be found. Perhaps it will never get this far, by the grace of God, but I can already see environments where no one believes in God. There are whole departments and even companies who deny the existence of God. So far, I have always been able to find one or two Christians. At ECT there was one in 2000, at PwC there were none. At Quinity there were two out of 200, at Media Markt I had not met any Christians within the 200 people there. At Staples there was one out of the 300 employees, but he left after a few months and at Knab (0 out of 200) and Rabobank (1 or 2 out of 30).
The results are very meager, perhaps they are higher, but I have not been able to detect them, not even by a simple prayer before lunch.
