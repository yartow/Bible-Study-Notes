# Isaiah 3

**Isaiah 3 (NIV) Judgment on Jerusalem and Judah**
*1 See now, the Lord,*
*the Lord Almighty,*
*is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah*
*both supply and support:*
*all supplies of food and all supplies of water,*
*2 the hero and the warrior,*
*the judge and the prophet,*
*the diviner and the elder,*
*3 the captain of fifty and the man of rank,*
*the counselor, skilled craftsman and clever enchanter.*

This prophecy was probably fulfilled when the Babylonians came to abduct the educated people, leaving alone the farmers, their wives and their children to take care of the land. 
When God takes away something, in order to let people learn from it, He does it in the right way. He has been very patient, but at this time it all comes at once. Both supplies and support. Most probably a lot of family is in that support as well.
God, it seems, was less patient with the Egyptians in the time of Joseph. He asked the pharaoh through Moses three time (at least) to change his mind concerning His people, and even then, when Pharaoh still did not listen, God did not unleash all of His anger on him, but slowly punished him and his people step by step.
The Jews could have suffered this kind of fate as well, but perhaps many more would have been killed then over a much longer period. 

*4 “I will make mere youths their officials;*
*children will rule over them.”*
*5 People will oppress each other—*
*man against man, neighbor against neighbor.*
*The young will rise up against the old,*
*the nobody against the honored.*

In communism this prophecy has partly been fulfilled. Now imagine what will happen in later times. 
In Chinese communism children were taught that all the rich people and educated people, such as teachers, were the bad ones, because they had stolen the money from the poor. The children got to beat up these "bad" people. 
In the Sino-Japanese war Japanese people were taught that the Chinese people were worth nothing. And so when they got to war, the Japanese treated the Chinese as such, performing rapes and beheadings as entertainment. 
The children were ruling over the older people. 
In the *Occupy Wall Street* movement of 2011 the "nobodies", the normal people again had this thought. People were rich because they stole money from the poor. The rich people were on Wall Street and the government had to do something about that. 
The logic is nonsensical. What has a hard-working man stolen from a middle-class or lower-class person? Why is this middle- or lower-class person not so rich? Is it not because of his own environment and his lack of discipline and diligence? Why do people on Wall Street need to be punished for that?
It is jealousy that drives them all. Mao was jealous of the rich and educated, because he himself was not; the Japanese were jealous because the Chinese were—and still are—heir ancestors. 

*6 A man will seize one of his brothers*
*in his father’s house, and say,*
*“You have a cloak, you be our leader;*
*take charge of this heap of ruins!”*
*7 But in that day he will cry out,*
*“I have no remedy.*
*I have no food or clothing in my house;*
*do not make me the leader of the people.”*

Though this part follows up the previous verse, it might refer to another situation. Just like I have sketched different situations in *post bellum* China and Japan, and a recent situation in the United States, this verse might refer to a different situation. 
This situation might describe that of a country where one is called to be a leader. I cannot think of which country exactly, but Suriname vaguely comes to mind. It is a country with no universities, where a lot of the intellectual people go abroad to study and stay there. A country with little natural resources, such as gold and perhaps other metals or minerals, but with a lot of forest that is destroyed in the mining of it. Nothing can be planted on all of the mined place, because the ground is polluted with mercury. 
Why I said "vaguely" is because there are people who want to be leaders, mostly because of the corruption which is very profitable for them. Desi Bouterse is one such person. The country is in so much debt, he has raised taxes and prices of energy by hundreds of percentages and the country is suffering as a cause of it. The rent is increasing as well because landlords cannot pay their energy bills. Stores are closing, because they cannot pay the energy bills and increase of rent. 
Similar things are happening in the rest of the world, in many Asian and African countries. One day everything will come together, all of the above "issues" will not be spread over multiple countries, but be present in each country—perhaps with Israel as an exception. Then the world will look up to Israel and wonder why they do not have these problems. The answer will then be because Israel abides by the Law of God. But that is only if Israel is willing to listen. 

*8 Jerusalem staggers,*
*Judah is falling;*
*their words and deeds are against the Lord,*
*defying his glorious presence.*

We may not forget that in the first place this description is about Israel—and perhaps about Judah only.
A province and a city are falling. One might even say a whole country, as it was the case at that time, but denoted by its largest city, Jerusalem. Why was it falling? Because what they said and did was against the Lord, and not only that, they were *defying* Him, and still not only that, they were defying *His glorious presence.*
Now it is one thing to say and another thing to do what is against the Lord, but the Israelites went much further than that. They resisted Him, *openly*, which is defiance. In doing so they triggered other people to do so with them. 
**One thing that is worse than one's own sin, is the sin to cause others to sin, and that is the Israelites did.** They did not do their own sin, they wanted others to sin as well, so that they would not stand out as the only one (or the minority) in sin. They thought that as long as they had the people on their side, it is okay to behave bad, because then nobody would criticize. 
That is the reason why these bad people hate Christians so much, because they refuse to go with the flow and do criticize the bad people. These bad people know they are doing the wrong thing, but as long as they have the multitude on their side, they are content to live the way they do.
The sad thing is that the multitude has been tricked by these bad people—though it still is their own fault for listening to the wrong people and not doing research, and in their fault dragging others with them as well. But it is this multitude that the good ones care about. They need to realize which side is the good side and what God's will is. 
So this is only their first sin. **The second sin is that they were defying God.** Now the one who resists and rebels will be put to the sword, Isaiah wrote in Isaiah 1:18. But the one who *openly* resists and denies God, what will happen to him? Not only is he inciting others, which again incurs the first sin, but he is also letting people contempt the Lord, by showing them that the Lord is not punishing Him. 
It would be like one shouting defamation against the Lord and then saying: *"See, if God were really to exist, He would strike me down with lightning."*
And if nothing happens, he would say: *"You see, He does not exist. You do not have to be afraid of Him or obey any of His laws."* 
What would then happen? Of course the multitude would be inclined to follow these radicals, for inherently everyone is bad. But those who stimulate the bad in others, instead of teaching to restrain oneself, are to be punished more than others. 
**The third sin is ignoring God's presence.** Anyone who is ignored would feel like he is treated with disrespect. Someone who has done a lot for the people yet being ignored by the people would feel dignified. Someone of a higher status having sacrificed himself for people of lower status who do not deserve to be saved, yet not receiving the credits he is supposed to will seriously go out of his mind and wonder why he ever cared about these people. 
Now imagine God Who not only *created* His people, but also created everything around them to sustain them, Who not only saved them once but countless times throughout thousands of years, while they did not deserve to be saved, because they sinned against God and against their own people. What would God feel if He were standing there, in their midst. He just gave them riches and everything they need. Yet no one is turning his head to look at him and thank him. 
This is the same as telling God you do not *want* Him here. He will not listen to your commands, but he will not force Himself upon you either. 

*9 The look on their faces testifies against them;*
*they parade their sin like Sodom;*
*they do not hide it.*
*Woe to them!*
*They have brought disaster upon themselves.*

They might say they did not know they were ignoring God or did not realize He was standing there, just like people in this age will always have an excuse for not wanting to know God, such as "*How can I love a God Who allows so much pain in this world?"*
But by the look on their faces you can see they are lying. That is not the reason why they do not follow God, it is because they are led by their pleasure. They had rather be accepted by the people than by God. 
The gay community is one that clearly shows an example of this. They perfectly know that what they do is wrong and not natural. The people who have scientifically *proved* that there is a gay gene and that it is perfectly normal, usually — if not all — are not gay themselves. They do not realize how it feels to be gay, but gays themselves have known clearly, before they came out, that what they wanted was wrong. 
Gays are hiding now behind the gay community and the non gay people who vouch for them. It is the only way for them to be accepted. They want to be accepted so much by the people, they had rather mock other people who are against it, just so that they will be put on a pedestal. The mocking of Mozilla CEO by forcing him to resign just because he is for traditional marriage and against gay marriages, is one such example. 
Milo Yiannopoulis was right when he said that gays are definitely not an oppressed minority. 

*10 Tell the righteous it will be well with them,*
*for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.*
*11 Woe to the wicked!*
*Disaster is upon them!*
*They will be paid back*
*for what their hands have done.*

It is good to know that we are doing the right thing and that it will be well with us and that disaster is upon the wicked. 
We do not have to worry about such things. God will take care of that. 

*12 Youths oppress my people,*
*women rule over them.*
*My people, your guides lead you astray;*
*they turn you from the path.*

We must know that in two ways the world is not as it should be governed. 
The first one is that youth are oppressing the people. Young people are almost always greater in number than older people. In times of war or after war, what remains are people over 50 and people under 18 years of age. 
In Suriname it is the young people who have chosen (the corrupt and criminal) Desi Bouterse to become president.
As for the women, they have such a big voice now in the West with feminism, control over their own bodies, that their power sometimes is bigger than that of men. Sometimes women get jobs for which they are less qualified, purely because the ratio of women to men is too small. 
The people know that men have been very bad to women and now want to give women more rights to compensate for the past. But just like with racial issues, compensation is not the solution, but only makes it worse. 
Men become weak, by giving women these rights. By feeling guilty they think that can give something back to women, while God is in fact telling them that the best thing they can give is to lead them. Instead, they give them the opportunity to work, so that children have to go to daycare. 
Now women are not happy for *having to* build a career, just so that they can match men's standards, and missing their child's [growth]. 
Their bonding with their children becomes less and children become emotionally less stable and compensate that with all kinds of things we see in current generations now, such as criminality, drugs and sex, but also pop music and rock, which leads to the former.  
 
I do not know what the young people have done in Israel, but this could be seen in two ways. Either it really was the young people and women who were ruling in Israel, just like there were very young kings in the lineage of Jesus (I forgot the names) but there were also women who rules, such as Ahaz's wife. The same thing happened in ancient China.
Another interpretation is that they would be conquered by other countries and these would let their women and children over the Israelites. 

*13 The Lord takes his place in court;*
*he rises to judge the people.*
*14 The Lord enters into judgment*
*against the elders and leaders of his people:*
*“It is you who have ruined my vineyard;*
*the plunder from the poor is in your houses.*
*15 What do you mean by crushing my people*
*and grinding the faces of the poor?”*
*declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty.*

The Lord is the Judge Who *will* take place in *his* court. He, however, decides when he takes place. But when He does, He enters in judgment. It is not a matter of asking what the situation is, what the problem is or finding out who is the culprit. He will point His finger to the guilty ones, accuse them of their charge and convict them. 

*16 The Lord says,*
*“The women of Zion are haughty,*
*walking along with outstretched necks,*
*flirting with their eyes,*
*strutting along with swaying hips,*
*with ornaments jingling on their ankles.*

Zion, Jerusalem, was and perhaps still is the biggest city in Israel. It is not as modern in architecture as Tel Aviv, and a little more conservative. It seems like there is a negative correlation between conservatism and modernism. It seems as if these things cannot go together. Also, the larger the city, the more liberal and progressive. 
Along with progressiveness comes [... flirtatious ...?] behavior of women, as men have always behaved themselves this way. Women want to gain their power through their body and sexuality. They think they actually have power when men desire them. Usually that is the, when you have something others desire, than you have power over them. This goes for products created, such as the iPhone, but also for money. 
The difference between sex and other things is that when you have something else than sex, money for example, you ask a person to do something and he does this, and then you pay him money. But in the case of sex you have the other person will do something and in return this person will ask you to do something as well, and it's most likely even something you do not like. Now *this person* has control over *you*! And you are obliged to do it, because he has already "paid" you. 

*17 Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion;*
*the Lord will make their scalps bald. ”*
*18 In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces, 19 the earrings and bracelets and veils, 20 the headdresses and anklets and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms, 21 the signet rings and nose rings, 22 the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses 23 and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls.*
*24 Instead of fragrance there will be a stench;*
*instead of a sash, a rope;*
*instead of well-dressed hair, baldness;*
*instead of fine clothing, sackcloth;*
*instead of beauty, branding.*
*25 Your men will fall by the sword,*
*your warriors in battle.*
*26 The gates of Zion will lament and mourn;*
*destitute, she will sit on the ground.*

The Lord will punish these women for their behavior while they know it is wrong. Men are punished too with sexually transmitted diseases for example, but still less than women are punished. For women get STDs *and* they get punished in these ways. 
The men, on the other hand, are punished less in life, but are punished more through life. Their lives will be taken away because they will need to go to war and lose their life there. 
As can be seen in the next chapter, there will not be enough men around to provide husbands for every woman and women again must suffer the shame of not being able to be married and have children.
