# Isaiah 66 (ESV)
**The Humble and Contrite in Spirit**
*1 Thus says the Lord:*
*“Heaven is my throne,*
*and the earth is my footstool;*
*what is the house that you would build for me,*
*and what is the place of my rest?*

seems to be quite different from the previous parts. In the previous chapter Isaiah spoke about everything God will do for us. It is so much, so unimaginable even, that we cannot ever pay it back. But even if we could, what could we ever give to God that He does not already have? 
We must understand that we are part of this world and God lives outside of this world. We could never escape our dimension and give him something He could use. Then what about the immaterial things? Does our worship and obedience not amount to anything? Yes, surely they are worth something, but all the good man can do in a lifetime is not even enough to outdo all the bad he has done. This even goes for the holiest people of all. I will not mention Gandhi or Buddha as one of those people, for even though they tried to live morally good lives, they do have brought so many people to Hinduism and Buddhism and brought them to idolatry, pagan rituals and all kinds of other things that have only brought people further away from God. 
Then what people like the pope or Mother Theresa? Regardless of how good their lives were after their conversion, both of them have done bad things in their past. The former even sold weapons to the Nazis #todo/opzoeken Wat heeft Mother Theresa gedaan? 

*2 All these things my hand has made,*
*and so all these things came to be,*
*declares the Lord.*

What God declares here goes deeper than the words. After God made things, it came into *being*. We can make a lot of things, but nothings then *becomes*. First of all, it was already there, we merely combined a number of ingredients when cooking, or alter some when performing chemistry. 
We can say that the Internet came into existing, but it was merely a combination of transmission techniques and centrally stored data. Nothing actually came into *being*, not in the way like God did. 

*But this is the one to whom I will look:*
*he who is humble and contrite in spirit*
*and trembles at my word.*

We cannot bribe God, for everything to Him is little to no value. He can favor some though and explains in this verse how, by being humble and contrite in spirit and tremble at His word. This means concretely that we should always know our position, that this is way below God’s, that we be mournful for and convicted of our sins and that we treat everything in the Bible and everything God says very seriously—so serious that we are afraid, not as if, but actually because there are repercussions for not obeying it. 

*3 “He who slaughters an ox is like one who kills a man;*
*he who sacrifices a lamb, like one who breaks a dog's neck;*
*he who presents a grain offering, like one who offers pig's blood;*
*he who makes a memorial offering of frankincense, like one who blesses an idol.*
*These have chosen their own ways,*
*and their soul delights in their abominations;*
*4 I also will choose harsh treatment for them*
*and bring their fears upon them,*
*because when I called, no one answered,*
*when I spoke, they did not listen;*
*but they did what was evil in my eyes*
*and chose that in which I did not delight.”*

Killing an animal is like killing a human. God values the life of animals, not just as much as human lives, but enough to ask retribution for it. It is only because human life is worth more than animal life, that if one has to choose between humans or animals, God chooses humans and the animal has to suffer. It is for this very reason that God asks us to sacrifice animals so that it is not us who have to die for our sin. Of course, this is only a symbol and typology of Jesus Who will actually die for our sin, whilst animal sacrifices are done to let people realize the seriousness of this. 
For example, which horse or dog owner, who loves his animals, would willingly sacrifice his animals just for fun? None. But would they be willing to sacrifice one to save their children’s life? Yes. So when his child has done something worth being put in prison for or being executed for, this animal owner is most likely more than willing to sacrifice one of his animals in exchange for his child’s life. 
The government, or at least the penitentiary branch, cannot simply allow this sinful child to walk free without letting him or at least his father feel the pain of the (repercussion of the) committed sin. 
Now the Israelites, whom God through Isaiah is speaking of in this part, are sacrificing to idols and presumably to God as well, were sacrificing to please their gods, for selfish reasons so that they could get more—more materials, more fruitfulness, more sex. In other words, they were willing to sacrifice others, without remorse, so it would better them. 
How cruel and bad must one be to slaughter horses, dogs and cats (to put it in this day’s context), not out of necessity, not in order to be pay for one’s crime, but just to get rich? Unfortunately, this is not rare and we see that many do things like that. We see it happening in movies like *Casino*, maybe *Goodfellas* #tags/movies , I do not remember, and *Scarface*. After a while, after all the killing, lives are not worth more than dogs’ lives which are not worth much to begin with in those (Latin) cultures, and they kill them just as easily, partly out of necessity, to show an example, but for selfish reasons nonetheless, not because of remorse and contriteness, which God asks of us.
Now God returns what humans have done to each other and to Him. He will repay, as shown in the last line. 

*5 Hear the word of the Lord,*
*you who tremble at his word:*
*“Your brothers who hate you*
*and cast you out for my name's sake*
*have said, Let the Lord be glorified,*
*that we may see your joy’;*
*but it is they who shall be put to shame.*
*6 “The sound of an uproar from the city!*
*A sound from the temple!*
*The sound of the Lord,*
*rendering recompense to his enemies!*

**Rejoice with Jerusalem**
*7 “Before she was in labor*
*she gave birth;*
*before her pain came upon her*
*she delivered a son.*
*8 Who has heard such a thing?*
*Who has seen such things?*
*Shall a land be born in one day?*
*Shall a nation be brought forth in one moment?*
*For as soon as Zion was in labor*
*she brought forth her children.*
*9 Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause to bring forth?”*
*says the Lord;*
*“shall I, who cause to bring forth, shut the womb?”*
*says your God.*

The question here is whether God has ever said He would do something and not done it, or whether He has ever not fulfilled what He stands for, that is everything that He represents, His character and person. Would God ever let injustice go unpunished?
Or an even better question is, would God ever do something and then not finish it? Would He bring the Israelites half way out of Egypt so they could perish there? Would He bring them across the Jordan only to die by the hands of the people of Jericho? 
No, there is not a single story in the Bible that has no ending. Even the story of mankind that has not yet ended, has its ending described in the book of Revelations.

*10 “Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her,*
*all you who love her;*
*rejoice with her in joy,*
*all you who mourn over her;*
*11 that you may nurse and be satisfied*
*from her consoling breast;*
*that you may drink deeply with delight*
*from her glorious abundance.”*
*12 For thus says the Lord:*
*“Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river,*

The picture of a river is used here once again, in this case to symbolize peace. As mentioned in this devotional somewhere before, a river has many properties, but one thing is that it keeps bringing fresh water. God's peace will not be like a drug which feels fresh the first few times one uses it, but later on it becomes more of a burden than an enlightenment, like a hangover?
from which one cannot wake up and from which one has a worse hangover or crash than when one would not have used it. 
No, God's peace is fresh and assures people even when one encounters the biggest problems of all. 

*and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream;*

If one has ever been near a river, he will realize how mighty any river is, especially those like the Mississippi, Amazon or the big and wild Chinese rivers, but even the smaller ones like the Jordan or the Rhine. No man can stop it. Even a slowly drifting and small river could break a dam. What is bigger than a river? An overflowing one. 
Rivers have the power to destroy everything on their way. The amount of water is incredible. The distance they lay as well, even in modern times with airlines it could take hours before the beginning or end of it is reached. 
What happens when a river is stopped? It continues to flow, sideways upwards, able to fill whole valleys higher than mountains, as in the case with the Hoover Dam. 

*and you shall nurse, you shall be carried upon her hip,*
*and bounced upon her knees.*

The picture of a child here, not even able to cling on to its mother steadily, bouncing while he goes, let alone able to walk, feed or defend itself, or to take care of others, that is what Israel is and what we humans are. 
Perhaps we as humans *individually* are able to do all of this *physically*, as adults, but spiritually we are not able to take care of other peoples. Would we be able to tell an upcoming nation how they should live, what civil and moral laws they should have and what religion or world view? We cannot even maintain this in our own country. 
Even those on the Right aisle of the political spectrum have issues within their party, even Christians have disputes within denominations and within denominations, aside from the very specific sub-denominations such as those of the Reformed and Baptist churches, and even aside from the name-Christians who are not actually reborn, and aside from those who have not studied theological issues on a deeper level, there still are so many differences on all aspects of the moral and civil law. 
Take for example food and the raising of children. Should we eat kosher, healthy or organic, or is this of lower priority? As for raising children, every Christian agrees this is important, but how should they be raised? Should they mingle with non-Christians, with strictness and a firm hand, even with corporal punishments when needed? As for the latter, I see many families where raising children is priority and where the father wants to be strict, but he is not living it up, either because his limit is in the strictness of his voice or because he simply cannot be this strict. 
In short, Christians do not know the best way, generally speaking, neither are they capable of teaching others or other peoples. It is only through grace that some of us have grown into mature adulthood and gained some common sense, some intelligence to comprehend what the Bible really teaches and to live this out in the way God desires. It most certainly is not because of our discipline and our desire to follow God. 

All of this concerns the latter two examples of the hip and the knees in verse 12. But the first example is about nursing or drinking milk. Even obtaining our food, when it is right in front of us, is something we are not capable of. Milk is preserved in the breast, where it stays fresh. It is in a nipple, where it can come out in exact amounts. Human babies cannot handle plastic nipples too well. Some have holes that are too big and deliver too much milk for the child to ingest; others have holes that are too small that cannot let undissolved parts of milk go through, which cause these to clog. Apparently even drinking is too difficult. How much more do we need God in our lives when we realize we are but babies, in every field, except for our innocence. 

*13 As one whom his mother comforts,*
*so I will comfort you;*

This time God, our Father, says He will comfort like a mother. God is male nor female, but He possesses all of the good masculine and feminine traits. So when He created mankind, He created them male and female to inserted in them His traits, where the woman possesses more of the feminine traits and the male more of the masculine traits. 
Comfort is one of the feminine traits and put in the mother. Like a mother, perhaps almost naturally, comforts her child, so God will comfort His children. 

*you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.*

Moreover, God says that the Israelites will be comforted *in* Jerusalem. I do not think "in" refers to the location here, but rather to the source. Jerusalem is their mother city, it is the symbol of their relationship with God  and it is in this (i.e. the relationship) that they will be comforted. 
For example, when one dies he can say: "At least I have ..." where the blanks are filled in with something important. The truth is, knowing God and having a relationship with Him are the most important things in life. So having this relationship will comfort anyone—when he understands the value of this. 
So those who have this relationship with God can say, even when things go bad or when they are about to die: "At least I have known God." 

*14 You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice;*
*your bones shall flourish like the grass;*

Knowing all of this rejoices us, Israelites and Christians alike. We know this is coming and we have faith in it. Some have less faith and rejoice less, but those who have more hope and faith in God, will rejoice more. But even more than this, will the people rejoice who have seen what will come. Those who are already in heaven have seen the promises of God fulfilled, they have experienced the comfort of God—and even they can still rejoice over what is to come, which is the salvation of Jerusalem as God's undivided and holy city, set apart for worshippers of Him only. 
The opposite of what I mentioned before about bones in Isaiah 58 is now mentioned here in verse 14, where bones, like man, do not age, hurt, become brittle and break, but they will flourish and grow and be as new as bones in young children, fresh and newly grown. This is all the more reason to rejoice when Isaiah 58 and its devotional notes are read again.

*and the hand of the Lord shall be known to his servants,*
*and he shall show his indignation against his enemies.*

Another thing that really makes people rejoice is what we see in children. When a child sees the strength of his father, he is proud. He sees the hand of his father, he knows what strength there is in it and he knows what good or bad there is, that is against whom his father will use this hand. 
When we, as God's servants and children, see God's hand we know it is Almighty and he shows it for His indignation against His enemies. We rejoice for this is what we want to see, that the unjust are punished. 

**Final Judgment and Glory of the Lord**
*15 “For behold, the Lord will come in fire,*
*and his chariots like the whirlwind,*
*to render his anger in fury,*
*and his rebuke with flames of fire.*
*16 For by fire will the Lord enter into judgment,*
*and by his sword, with all flesh;*
*and those slain by the Lord shall be many.*

We have to know that this fire, however beautiful it may look, is deadly because it purifies everything unclean, which includes us as well. By that time it is not a matter of *how* clean we are. Being mostly clean and a little unclean does not mean we will we will only suffer a little from this fire. No, it is all or nothing, so we will suffer completely or we will be saved completely. 
Note that I am not claiming that the fire with which this chariot comes will be the fire that cleanses us, the Earth or that it is the fire through which we must pass (cf. 1 Corinthians 3:15). However, it is a symbol that God comes to purify, in bright light, to save and to judge. 
His fire is also a symbol of His fury. Fury, perhaps by definition, implies that one is fed up, it is not the first time something happened, one is full with it and cannot take it any longer. In the same way God will some day feel like this and act out His judgement. 
It is foretold here that those slain shall be many. Whoever claims that no people will go to hell or that everyone will suffer the same fate, be it good or bad, is proved wrong here. Though hell and heaven are not mentioned here specifically, there are definitely differences between those who trust in Him and those who do not. A more specific definition of those people is explained in the next verse. 

*17 “Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst, eating pig's flesh and the abomination and mice, shall come to an end together, declares the Lord.*

The ones who come to an end, first of all, are those who worship other gods. They worship them not just in their minds and behavior, but through their actions. 
A new religion is rising in this age, called *atheism*, which is different from what "atheism" is according to its definition and what it used to be. Now it entails not only a disbelief in God, but also a rebellion against anything that is deemed moral from the Bible. It would almost entail the opposite of everything from the Ten Commandments if they did not have the little that is left of their logic and nature, but even that, Paul says in Romans 1:24, will someday be eradicated. To name but a few examples of those: 
1. Killing of babies has become normal, up to birth and some strive for after birth, but killing of murderers through death row, is abolished. 
2. Lying has become common, just like violence, as long as it is for the "good". 
3. Adultery does not exist anymore, by definition, because the institution of marriage is slowed eroded by people living together. But even still, multiple partners are not seen as something "bad", see for example Ethan Hawke's comments on that (in Wikipedia) about emphasizing the sin of adultery. 

*18 “For I know their works and their thoughts, and the time is coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and shall see my glory, 19 and I will set a sign among them. And from them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the coastlands far away, that have not heard my fame or seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory among the nations. 20 And they shall bring all your brothers from all the nations as an offering to the Lord, on horses and in chariots and in litters and on mules and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the Lord, just as the Israelites bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the Lord. 21 And some of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says the Lord.*
*22 “For as the new heavens and the new earth*
*that I make*
*shall remain before me, says the Lord,*
*so shall your offspring and your name remain.*
*23 From new moon to new moon,*
*and from Sabbath to Sabbath,*
*all flesh shall come to worship before me,*
*declares the Lord.*
*24 “And they shall go out and look on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me. For their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.”*
