**Hezekiah's Sickness and Recovery**
*1 In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, “Thus says the Lord: Set your house in order, for you shall die, you shall not recover.” 2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord, 3 and said, “Please, O Lord, remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.*
*4 Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah: 5 “Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life. 6 I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and will defend this city.*

Hezekiah did not give up even though he heard the message from Isaiah a fact, a promise of the Lord. But still he asked the Lord for help. These are the good and notable things he did:
1. He did not go against the Lord. The Lord said he would die, so that is what would happen. He did not look for remedies and medicine to keep him alive. He knew that God was the only important factor in this. If he wanted to stay alive, then only God could keep him. 
2. He asked the Lord for help, not anyone else. He pleaded the Lord for help. This is what God wants from us, to ask Him and Him alone. 
3. He cried. God wants us to open our hearts to Him. He sees our tears and feels our feelings.

*7 “This shall be the sign to you from the Lord, that the Lord will do this thing that he has promised: 8 Behold, I will make the shadow cast by the declining sun on the dial of Ahaz turn back ten steps.” So the sun turned back on the dial the ten steps by which it had declined.*
*9 A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, after he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:*
*10 I said, In the middle of my days*
*I must depart;*
*I am consigned to the gates of Sheol*
*for the rest of my years.*
*11 I said, I shall not see the Lord,*
*the Lord in the land of the living;*
*I shall look on man no more*
*among the inhabitants of the world.*
*12 My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me*
*like a shepherd's tent;*
*like a weaver I have rolled up my life;*
*he cuts me off from the loom;*
*from day to night you bring me to an end;*
*13 I calmed myself until morning;*
*like a lion he breaks all my bones;*
*from day to night you bring me to an end.*
*14 Like a swallow or a crane I chirp;*
*I moan like a dove.*
*My eyes are weary with looking upward.*
*O Lord, I am oppressed; be my pledge of safety!*
*15 What shall I say? For he has spoken to me,*
*and he himself has done it.*
*I walk slowly all my years*
*because of the bitterness of my soul.*
*16 O Lord, by these things men live,*
*and in all these is the life of my spirit.*
*Oh restore me to health and make me live!*
*17 ::Behold, it was for my welfare*::
::*that I had great bitterness;*::
::*but in love you have delivered my life*::
::*from the pit of destruction,*::
::*for you have cast all my sins*::
::*behind your back.*::  

Here too, Hezekiah says that bitterness had a purpose, it was even for his *welfare*! It is like one who has been beaten saying: "It was for my own good"! It takes enormous honesty and a great deal self-reflection to be able to say this. 
Not unrelated to this Hezekiah also says that *because* his sins have been cast away—behind God's back, or in other words, such that even God does not see them anymore—his life has been delivered from destruction. Hezekiah is speaking about hell here, assuming that the Sheol refers to that, and he knows he will not enter hell because God has cast away his sins, but also that he will not enter the realm of death—I am not sure if this is the same as Sheol #todo/opzoeken —because he will live. 
I assume the realm of death, which consists of heaven and hell, are distinguished and that Sheol here is referring to hell. For what would sin otherwise have to do with Sheol? The only explanation I can think of is that Hezekiah had to die because of his many sins. This would, however, not fit with his statement in verse 3 concerning the (many) things he has done which were good in God's sight.

*18 For Sheol does not thank you;*
*death does not praise you;*
*those who go down to the pit do not hope*
*for your faithfulness.*

This is a strong confirmation that Sheol does not contain heaven. 

*19 The living, the living, he thanks you,*
*as I do this day;*
*the father makes known to the children*
*your faithfulness.*

As a father I should let my child (only one for now) know how good You have been to me, how faithful and how loving. All of Your characteristics are worthy to mention, they all stand out, but perhaps faithfulness is one thing we as humans can relate to and understand perhaps slightly better than the other characteristics how faithful You are, for faithfulness is gone in this world. It is hard for spouses to stay faithful to each other and they had rather choose the easy way of divorce, in this way even losing their faithfulness to their children. How so? In getting children every married couple makes an implicit promise to the child to continually care for them—except for those having unwanted children, but I assume these children are given away for adoption, because if they are not given away, the same responsibility applies here, namely if you choose to keep the child, you are responsible for it and provide it with a safety and love to the best of your capabilities. 
Faithfulness consists of abiding by one's own words. None of us know what the future will bring, so we can make a promise in marriage or in something else. If the situation turns bad, some will try to make it work, while others give up, not having expected this cost to stay faithful and rather break a promise than pay this cost. You, on the other hand, know the future and how hard-headed the Israelites would be and still you chose to give Your promise to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and later on to David while You knew Solomon and about 12 of the future kings of Judah would sin and lead the people of Israel into sin. You are faithful and although Your faithfulness has boundaries, such as when you gave the land of Israel over to the Assyrians and later to the Babylonians, it has always been Your plan to return it to Your people. 
We can never achieve that kind of faithfulness, but I ask you, Lord, to help me become more like You every day and have more of that faithfulness for You in the first place, and to my wife and child in the second place. 

*20 The Lord will save me,*
*and we will play my music on stringed instruments*
*all the days of our lives,*
*at the house of the Lord.*

Music and worship almost seem to go together. I think everyone likes music, be it a different kind of music, but can anyone imagine a birthday without music or a triumph of war or of sports without music? It is almost impossible and it seems like God has made this a part of us. This is another thing that animals do not have or enjoy, because it is something that touches the soul. 
I still do not understand why Africans have more of this than Westerners, who used to have some of it in the Middle Ages (at least in movies with people singing in castles) and why the hot climate countries are more cheerful in their music than the cold climate countries, with the oriental (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) cultures and perhaps even the other Asian countries (among which India) as an exception. 
About the latter, I think there is third culture consisting of at least the oriental cultures. In intercultural church these cultures are the least willing to mingle with other cultures and accept these as equal. Also, my observation is that Indians and Chinese are present in most countries of the world. There is a section we are missing here. 
Sarah Lanier #tags/famouspeople/christian#, author of the book #tags/books *Foreign to Familiar* bisected the world's cultures into *hot* and *cold* ones, recognizable by their perception of honor and vivid expressions of music, but even she acknowledged China in some cases as an exception—though I forgot which one exactly. 
She divided a culture in five "categories" such as the values of hierarchy, relations and organizational matters. There is, however, also an economic aspect which she has not mentioned. The Chinese, Indians and some of the Western countries are known for their merchant history across the world, and among the latter there are the British, Dutch and perhaps the French. At the same time three of those countries are known for their "cheapness" and saving of money #todo/opzoeken which are China, India and the Dutch. 
A possible explanation is the current economy in those countries. China and India still are relatively poor countries with lower literacy rates, average longevity and low income per capita. The British and the French have risen from these circumstances and do not have to worry about their incomes anymore. However, the Dutch still are like that, although that might have to do with the Second World War, out of which the current generation's parents were born. #todo/opzoeken  In other words, there is no clear explanation for that, because we would have to address countries as Spain and Portugal as well.
My theory is a new sectioning of cultures as an adjustment of that of #todo/opzoeken  author of book
which will either create a third section, which is a section within the hot cultures, between the oriental and non-oriental countries, which typically are of high context, or it will make a virtual sectioning on top of the current one. With the latter I mean that there is sectioning to be made on typical traits and their origins e.g. cheapness and international trade, both
within cold as well as hot cultures. With the former, the high context, I mean that there should be another sectioning for cultures with a long *literate* context. African cultures, for example, may have existed for thousands of years, but have never a developed a formal written language (one language they used was one that was created by the Phoenicians) or created inventions. This is different from the Aztecs, Mayans, Egyptians and the oriental cultures—though these all derived from China.
Though this is heavily politically incorrect, it is my contention that this is a very significant regressor and may not be left out of the equation.

*21 Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs and apply it to the boil, that he may recover.” 22 Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the Lord?”*

God has incredible wisdom, about medicine as well, even though he does not need medicine to cure us. It is rather a test for us to see who obeys the Lord and to see His miracles. 
When Elisha threw some salt in brackish water or some coal #todo/opzoeken wat precies? 
and the water became purified he had to believe that God would heal the water, even though it does not sound logical. In the same way a cake of figs does not seem helpful for boils which is as a cause of cancer or due to something like the plague.
In the same way our health is determined in part by our "faith" in food and medicine, do we believe that apples will keep us healthy? If we are *willing* to do this, God sees this as beneficial and heals us. Yes, apples do contain anti-oxidants, but how they work exactly we do not know (yet). But as Christians we want to obey God and eat healthy and apples go as far as limiting oxidation, but God makes sure we stay healthy if it is according to His will.
