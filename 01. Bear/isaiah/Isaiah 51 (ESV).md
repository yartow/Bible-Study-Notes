# Isaiah 51 (ESV)
**The Lord's Comfort for Zion**
*1 “Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness,*
*you who seek the Lord:*
*look to the rock from which you were hewn,*
*and to the quarry from which you were dug.*

This not an argument for evolutionist to say that we came from a rock, although they might be inclined to it. What usually can be found on rocks are moss or algae, and quarries are big holes of nothing but rocks, one not distinguishable from the other, apart from the occasional diamond.

*2 Look to Abraham your father*
*and to Sarah who bore you;*
*for he was but one when I called him,*
*that I might bless him and multiply him.*

Abraham was indeed nothing special. Ethnically, he was just one person from the Middle East, from Iraq perhaps or wherever Ur is #todo/opzoeken Genetically he was related to Sem, the good son of Noah, but there were many more. He was not particularly healthy as he was old and said he could not have children (even though the problem most likely was Sarah, because Abraham got many children after her, with his second wife, although that could have been by divine intervention as well). 
He was righteous and faithful and that is why God chose him, but it is not the former that mattered most (perhaps there were more as righteous as he) but the latter, the choosing of God, which makes him special. 
For God can take someone who is not particularly special but bestow His blessings on this person and multiply him after which the blessings get multiplied as well.
*Look to Abraham* it says in verse two, but also look at all the Jews. How blessed are they? They control half if not most of the financial world and have been reputed to do so during the times of the Second World War #tags/historic events/wwii# , after which they might have lost a great deal. Not only financially, how much of academia and science do they "control"? For such a small people, consisting of only 7-15 million people in the world, less than 0.1% of the whole population, to have such a great impact and at the same time such a great resentment from the whole Western world. This must mean something. 
The blessings are from God, but the resentment and all the negativity is from the evil one. For why should anyone care about such a small country who is fairly good to its non-Jewish inhabitants, giving aids to its surrounding countries such as Jordan and Iran, even though they want the Jews dead, but who has killed relatively few Palestinians with bombs? By "few" I mean 1000. 
Then what about Nigeria #todo/opzoeken  where a thousands if not *thousands* of Christians were killed by Muslims *in one week*, where violence against people is still going on by Muslim Fulani shepherds, or 150 people by gunshots in Eritrea #todo/opzoeken and all the other dictatorial countries? The world is against Myanmar because of eviction and prosecution of Muslims, but what is actually done about that? I have seen rallies and boycots of Israel even in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, but I have never seen those about Myanmar or any other country. 
Something, or someone, must be inciting these people to go after Israel. This someone of course being the devil. 

*3 For the Lord comforts Zion;*
*he comforts all her waste places*
*and makes her wilderness like Eden,*
*her desert like the garden of the Lord;*
*joy and gladness will be found in her,*
*thanksgiving and the voice of song.*

Zion is the Lord's beloved. God loves her and comforts her. He would not let anything hurt her, not even a bit. Why then has Israel been hurt? It is because the took it upon herself. God would not allow anyone to hurt His bride, but if the bride hurts herself, He cannot help it, for He has given her freedom. If she decides to run, He will buy her back, but there is some time that passes before she has been bought back. 
Israel decided to go after other gods and to obey kings who worshipped pagan gods and join them in this idolatry as well. 
But He loves her so much that even after she has cheated on Him with other gods for many times, He is still willing to take her back if she truly repents. Then, He will make her fruitful again and thankful. 
The the question comes perhaps: if Israel had truly repented and was thankful, then why were they still so sinful and unsusceptible for the Gospel that Jesus Christ proclaimed? 
Was it because this description only indicated the first few years? Another explanation is that this does not apply to the whole of Israel. I do not think that ever in history the whole people of Israel agreed 100 percent on anything, neither would joy and gladness be in all of Israel. So perhaps these descriptions of happiness are meant for only a part of Israel. A third explanation is that this time is still to come.

*4 “Give attention to me, my people,*
*and give ear to me, my nation;*
*for a law will go out from me,*
*and I will set my justice for a light to the peoples.*
*5 My righteousness draws near,*
*my salvation has gone out,*
*and my arms will judge the peoples;*
*the coastlands hope for me,*
*and for my arm they wait.*

We know that a lot of what Isaiah says is referring to the future and mostly to Jesus' coming.  But what is this law that will go out from God. Did God have any new laws? Jesus in fact came to relieve people from the Law. The Law still existed, but people would be under Jesus and His forgiveness, not under the Law's perfect judgement, because everyone would be judged then. 
Jesus did give a new law, though, which is recorded in John 13:34-35 
> (ESV) A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. 35 By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”  
That is all I know about a *new* law. 
However, there is another explanation and that is that a law—an already existing one—would go out from Jesus, one that previously did not go out. This is the law of justice. God gave it, Moses, Micah and others proclaimed it, but it was not practiced correctly. Still, even in the 400 years after the Babylonian captivity, poverty was common and not much was done about it. Examples that made this clear were Zaccheus, or in more historical times, the stories of the widows that Elijah and Elisha attended. 
So the Israelites had done away with idols but not with the idol of money, still holding on to it, or the idol of themselves, protecting themselves first. 
Jesus proclaimed righteousness and it was shown immediately in the first church in Acts where serving the poor and needy was *practiced* and not only preached. 
Not only Israel, but a lot of countries were waiting for a law like this to be put in practice. But why only the coastlands? #biblestudy/questions
It is not saying *only* the coastlands. I am thinking that it is every country in the world that needs Jesus. There is not a single place where laws of righteousness have been implemented perfectly—not in the jungle where the strongest survive or in the concrete jungle of New York, where the fittest or in that case the richest and smartest survive, nor in any religious country, such as Buddhist, Islamic or Hindu country, especially not the latter by the way. In *some* Islamic countries the laws *may be* applied to a high degree, but there "righteousness" has a different meaning from that of Christians and Jews, and even a different meaning from that of the rest of the world. For in their righteousness a woman and a child have less rights than an adult man. 
#todo/opzoeken  is this hand or arm? What is the difference in Hebrew? 

*6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens,*
*and look at the earth beneath;*
*for the heavens vanish like smoke,*
*the earth will wear out like a garment,*
*and they who dwell in it will die in like manner;*
*but my salvation will be forever,*
*and my righteousness will never be dismayed.*
*7 “Listen to me, you who know righteousness,*
*the people in whose heart is my law;*
*fear not the reproach of man,*
*nor be dismayed at their revilings.*
*8 For the moth will eat them up like a garment,*
*and the worm will eat them like wool,*
*but my righteousness will be forever,*
*and my salvation to all generations.”*

The heavens, here probably indicating the separate layers in the atmosphere, or the atmosphere and the space above it with all the heavenly bodies in it, these will disappear one day. As we all know, stars die and so do planets. That part is true and everyone agrees with that. God's salvation, however, is forever. Of course, there needs to be something to salvage, so this statement means that the *effect* of His salvation is forever. If you have ever been saved, you are forever saved. #biblestudy/theology/calvinism/osas 

*9 Awake, awake, put on strength,*
*O arm of the Lord;*
*awake, as in days of old,*
*the generations of long ago.*
*Was it not you who cut Rahab in pieces,*
*who pierced the dragon?*

Now it seems like Isaiah is speaking to God the Father or to Jesus. 
It was God Who cut Rahab, which is probably Babylon, the whore, to pieces, but who is the dragon? In Revelations this is the devil, but... #biblestudy/questions
#todo/opzoeken ::Cf. Psalm 87:4 According to MacSBNnkjv this is Egypt in this case.:: 

*10 Was it not you who dried up the sea,*
*the waters of the great deep,*
*who made the depths of the sea a way*
*for the redeemed to pass over?*

Just like You opened up the Red Sea for the Jews to pass over, in the same way You can open up new ways for those in trouble. But notice that it says *redeemed*, which means that not everyone gets to pass this. In the situation of Moses most probably every Jew was redeemed, but now this is different, because we know that not all Jews returned from exile. 

*11 And the ransomed of the Lord shall return*
*and come to Zion with singing;*
*everlasting joy shall be upon their heads;*
*they shall obtain gladness and joy,*
*and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.*

The ransomed sounds to me that there are those who are *not* ransomed, meaning that these have not been paid for. We must know that the Lord died for all (cf. 2 Corinthians 5:15), and the price for that has been extracted from His body already, but the money has not been "given" so to speak to the kidnappers. Only for those who are willing to return to the Lord, Jesus Christ actually pays out the money.
Everlasting joy, is there anything like this on Earth? Sorrow and sighing fleeing away, this sounds like heaven or paradise. 
Or is Isaiah speaking of something temporary? Is he speaking about the moment the Jews return, that their sorrow and sighing will temporarily flee away? That I would understand, however, the joy would still be everlasting. So when the sorrow and sighing come back, and the joy is still everlasting, then would this joy be so much that the sorrow is not noticed? This does not seem realistic. 
The only explanation I have for this, is that this joy refers to the joy as in the Fruit of the Spirit, which is not happiness, but joyfulness. 
I am not sure if this characteristic of the Fruit of the Holy Spirit was present in the Old Testament, because only some had the Spirit then, and even that was only temporary, meaning that if the Spirit is only temporarily present in man, then the joy that comes from it is temporary as well and cannot be everlasting. 
Thus, the only everlasting joy comes from an ever present Spirit in man, which is only after Jesus' resurrection, meaning that verse 11 is meant for Christians.
Another question then comes to mind which is why Christians would *return* to Zion. Most Christians do not come *from* Zion, which is Jerusalem, so how could we then return to it? 
Notice that it does not say "return to Zion", that was my misreading, although I suppose it could have been translated that way, but that is not the case in the ESV. It says that the ransomed shall return and they will *come* to Zion. We, Christians, of course, are the ransomed, for we were slaves of the devil, but we have been ransomed now.

*12 “I, ~I am~ he who comforts you;* #todo/opzoeken 
*who are you that you are afraid of man who dies,*
*of the son of man who is made like grass,*
*13 and have forgotten the Lord, your Maker,*
*who stretched out the heavens*
*and laid the foundations of the earth,*
*and you fear continually all the day*
*because of the wrath of the oppressor,*
*when he sets himself to destroy?*
*And where is the wrath of the oppressor?*

God made creatures with intricate love and design, with fear in their hearts for their Maker only. God made everything where man is in, the Earth, the forests, the city, the house. 
Not only did some of those creatures forget Who their Maker was, but they forgot about His fear for Him as well and instead fear their fellowman. It is like children in class who fear their fellow students more than their teacher. (Of course, in the case of a friendly human (female) teacher one would not fear her, but in the case of an authoritative teacher, who could punish you corporally and even have impact on your resumé so to speak, why would one fear his fellow students more than his teacher?)
And the "funniest" thing is, not only do they fear other humans *all day long* and they do not fear God *at all*, but where is this "wrath" they fear? In other words, what can man possible do to him? 
Man can only kill him, kill his beloved ones or steal his possessions. All three things should not let the believer, as these creatures were initially created, fear his fellowman. Being killed leads to heaven, if his beloved ones are killed they will go to heaven as well, unless they have not been saved, but then his person has either married the wrong woman (of an unequal yoke) or it is his children who do not believe. 
In the latter case the situation is a bit more difficult. He has either been a bad example or God did not want his children to believe (or both of course). Is there any other possibility? #biblestudy/questions
In the latter case there is nothing you can do about it, in the former it is your own fault and you must carry the consequences for that. 
Either way, all this wrath is imaginary, for it is nothing compared to the wrath of God Who can destroy even the soul in hell. 

*14 He who is bowed down shall speedily be released;*
*he shall not die and go down to the pit,*
*neither shall his bread be lacking.*

Not the person who is strongest or most fit will survive, but the one who shows humility. For fear does not change people's hearts. People were afraid perhaps of strong leaders and they obeyed, like in the case of Castro, Lenin or Mao. Or they looked up to someone like Che, a revolutionist, and followed him. But their respect for them dissipates over time because after a revolution you must show something, and being revolutionary is not enough. And fear will dissipate as well, because there are things in life worth more than your own life, such as moral values. 
No, only love and humility before God can change the world in a better way. Jesus bowed down for God and served. He was humble and gave His life. He changed the world. 
Ghandi did the same as well as one of the Dalai Lamas, I remember #todo/opzoeken which led to many following them or their religion. Now I do not agree with Buddhism and Hinduism, nor do I agree that that attitude is always present in their practice—rather yet, it is the opposite (cf. Myanmar and Sri Lanka (Buddhist attacks on Muslims) and India (Hindu attacks on Muslims and Christians)—but this attitude is what—on the long run—changes people and let people know there is a different way. The way of the strongest is already known by everyone, everyone wants to be stronger so he can oppress the others or so that he does not have to be oppressed himself. 
Though the world does not take of those people, but perhaps it is exactly *because* of the world's attitude, God will take of them. 

*15 I am the Lord your God,*

#todo/opzoeken  ::According to MacSBNnkjv this is Israel::
#biblestudy/questions What does "you" mean here? Is it referring to Jesus or to us or to Isaiah? God has put His words not in our mouths, unless we are prophets, but He has put it in the mouths of Jesus and Isaiah.
God has covered both of the—as well as us—in the shadow of His hand, but the sentence directly after it says "establishing the heavens". It is grammatically not really clear to me who established the heavens. Is God (the Father, I presume) saying that He put the words in someone's mouth and let that person establish the heavens use His Words? It could not have been Isaiah because He has not established the heavens, this would only apply to Jesus but Jesus was not put words in His mouth for He *is* the Word, *coming*—rather than being put—*out* of God's mouth.
So if we lays this explanation aside and go the second one. The second explanation is that God put words in someone's mouth and established the heavens. It is acceptable to say that God (the Father) established the heavens, even though it was Jesus doing the work, because the same is said of kings, such as king Herod and Zerubbabel, and of Ezra when rebuilding the wall. Also, verse 15 does not say God the Father, but YHWH. 
But then we still have not identified who the addressed person is in verse 16.

*17 Wake yourself, wake yourself,*

#todo/opzoeken  waarom staat er in ESV niet het woord "drained"  maar in de KJV en SV wel, zoals respectievelijk "wrung out" en "uitgezogen"?

It is as if Israel is drunk and cannot stand up. Not only has she drunk from the cup of wrath, but also of the cup of staggering, and even to the dregs!
Like a person who is drunk and in the beginning drinks from a fine pint of beer, he is willing to drink anything, even homemade poisonous alcoholic drinks (as many do in Liberia, because there is no commercial alcohol available), and even the dregs, which are bitter, unhealthy, just for the little bit of alcohol to which they are so addicted. 
This metaphor speaks of the two things that characterize Israel. It is as if Israel has an addiction and keeps falling into her old patterns of idolatry and not trusting the Lord. 
In the books of Kings and Chronicles we can see that the bad kings worship idols (and with it do not trust God), but even the kings who do not worship idols (or at least in the beginning not) such as Asa and his son Jehosaphat #todo/opzoeken , and unfortunately the rest of the "good" kings as well—as far as I know #todo/opzoeken —except for Hezekiah, do not trust God with all their heart. They make deals with Israel or Syria (which was called Aram) and even Assyria and paid them off to not be invaded.
They *kept doing this*! No matter how many times God showed His faithfulness and that He provides and destroys whole armies without even the intervention of the Israel, while all the plunder is for the Israelites, still Israel does not rely on the Lord YHWH. 
How else can this be explained or where else do we see this pattern except in addicts to whom the good done for them is lost in oblivion directly after they have reaped the fruits from it? 
Now this behavior leads to God's wrath. I believe that hence this cup is named the *cup of wrath*. But it leads to a second despised behavior as well. Just like addicts not only use drugs or alcohol, they steal and have immoral sexual acts as well, if only to sell their bodies for money, but either way, they lose all morality due to their first sin. 

The cup of staggering could refer to the refusal of the Israelites to go back to their God. They were seduced indeed by the beauty of the pagan gods, such as easy access to blessings, simply by offering some animals or even have sexual interactions with prostitutes. Some offerings were more difficult, such as those to Molech where your own children had to be sacrificed and burned alive by putting them on hot metal arms of a metal statue.
But even after they realized they were wrong, and this happened in Judges and perhaps in the period of the divided kingdoms as well, did they go back to God? In the period of Judges it took years before they called out to God. The realization might have taken a year, the hunger and slavery by other nations took many years, but only at the very end when the Israelites could not hold out anymore, they were willing to call upon the Lord their God. 
As for the Israelites in the divided kingdoms it is the same, or even worse, they had to wait until there was a king who finally called upon God's mercy, which could take many generations and in the case of Judah—for Israel had *no* kings who called on God—there were only five kings who had done that, over a period of 600 years. 
Whence this staggering? Who put this stubborn, as God calls it, behavior in the Israelites or in people for that matter? 
Perhaps the verb "drinking" in verse 17 can be interpreted as an active verb, which indicates that the Israelites caused this staggering upon themselves. Remember, they not only *drank* from the cup, they drank it to the bottom, even the kegs. 
The first sin led to the second. Of course, it takes a sin before one can repent from this sin, and when many sins have been done, the step to ask for forgiveness becomes all the greater. But is that why the people of Israel waited so long? No, they went their way to find any other means possible to avoid apologizing to God and repent. 
It is not because they felt so ashamed that they did not even dare to face God, it is exactly because they did *not* feel ashamed and did *not* repent and not *want* to repent either. They thought that if they had won the war against Syria or their brother Judah or Israel, or Egypt or the bigger empires, they would not have to go to God and change their ways. They knew that going to God always implies change in their own lives. That is necessary before God acts, because true repentance leads to actions. 

So summarizing, their sins of idolatry led to the first cup, of wrath, but when they faced the consequences of destruction by other nations, they chose to drink from the second cup, of staggering, to postpone or annul the necessary repentance of their sins and the acknowledgement of God as their Savior. 

Is this world any different from theirs? Are the people here and now any different from back then? Are evolution and atheism not ways to escape God, just so they do not have to be accountable for their own sins? 

#church/material

*19 These two things have happened to you—*
*who will console you?—*
*devastation and destruction, famine and sword;*
*who will comfort you?*

What are these "two" things? Are these the cup of wrath and staggering? Or are these the two *pairs* of things mentioned in the third line? 
Devastation and destruction go together, they are quite similar, and famine and the sword as well, in such situations one dies by by either famine or the sword. In short, everything is linked and it could be more than four things that happen to you in the absence of a savior or in the absence of true repentance. 
So out of wrath come devastation and destruction, but when staggering, famine or the sword will come upon you as well. 
In between God keeps asking the perhaps rhetorical question: "Who will console or comfort you?" The answer is already clear and is no one on Earth, but One Person in heaven, our heavenly Father, He will and He has already tried to do that. 

*20 Your sons have fainted;*
*they lie at the head of every street*
*like an antelope in a net;*
*they are full of the wrath of the Lord,*
*the rebuke of your God.*

Now it gets even worse. As we recall, this wrath and staggering did not happen in one generation only. Later generations got to see what the previous generation experienced. As we have also seen in Judges, people could be staggering for as long as 70 years before calling on the Lord. 
But how could it be that a a new generation who has seen the previous generation full of idolatry and its negative effects still follows in its footsteps, only to experience the same negative consequences? They cannot be excuses that they have been taught this way. 
Many kings in Judah had these kinds of parents before them, but five were able to arise above it and do away with either the idols, the high places, the temple prostitutes, or with all of them. Indeed, the chances of doing this are smaller, but God provides each and every one with the strength to overcome these temptations, especially kings. Even king Josiah would do what is right at the age of seven—though he had the priest Jehoiada #todo/opzoeken  as his mentor.

*21 Therefore hear this, you who are afflicted,*
*who are drunk, but not with wine:*

Those who are afflicted are the ones in pain, either through their own fault or that of others. God says—about this situation—that they are drunk, though not with wine. He is referring to the cups of wrath and staggering, I assume. But I presume that those who are afflicted are always drunk with something. 
I am not saying that those inflicted have always incited God's wrath (and thus have drunk from his cup of wrath), because in some cases their pain was purely caused by someone else, such as in the case of physical or verbal abuse. These people are drunk with pain, of course, but that is after the affliction. 
#biblestudy/questions Could it be that these people are the exception? And that thus there is a group of innocent people who have been afflicted and are not drunk? People like Daniel for example, who were most definitely a part of this group. 

*22 Thus says your Lord, the Lord,* #todo/opzoeken  YHWH? Elohim?
*your God who pleads the cause of his people:*
*“Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering;*
*the bowl of my wrath you shall drink no more;*

We must know that has always been the One Who *pleads* for his people. 
We know that God never causes sin. It is always people's longing themselves who incite sin.
Note that God actually *takes* from *our* hand the cups. We took those cups ourselves, we could have let go and put these cups on the table. But we kept on drinking, and after the first cup came the second one.
How strange would it be that one would willingly drink from a cup on which is written "Cup of Wrath", knowing that he will incite God's wrath upon him. And the more one drinks from it, the more wrath.
It is not that someone drinks from it to test whether God will actually do something about it, and if after one sip nothing happens, he will say: "Oh, then I can have some more." No, God had punished the Israelites and Judahites in the beginning already, through famine, coups, chaos, financial crises and unemployment, and of course through the slaughter and slavery of their brothers in the north. They could see what would become of them. Yet they chose to continue. 

*23 and I will put it into the hand of your tormentors,*
*who have said to you,*
*‘Bow down, that we may pass over’;*
*and you have made your back like the ground*
*and like the street for them to pass over.”*

God is so merciful. Even after all that we have done, God is still willing to help us. It cannot be said otherwise than that this is the love of a parent. However, it actually is the other way around, it is the love of God and the love of parents is but an *image* of the love of God. 
God put His love in parents for their children so that we could *slightly* understand God's love for His children, and God put His love in (married) couples so that they could slightly understand His love for His Church. Because we humans are too small-minded and incapable of understanding any trait of God, He had to make human forms   and concepts of it which lessen the effect to a great deal, because humans then think that *that* is God. But they forget that it is only a fraction of the truth, like a movie is but a fraction of the suspense and emotions one gets from a book, and in return where the book is but a fraction of the real-life experiences of a person. 
God is so graceful that He even provides us justice and punishes those who have tormented us.
