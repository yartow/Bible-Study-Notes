# Isaiah 58 (ESV) 
**True and False Fasting**
*1 “Cry aloud; do not hold back;*
*lift up your voice like a trumpet;*
*declare to my people their transgression,*
*to the house of Jacob their sins.*
*2 Yet they seek me daily*
*and delight to know my ways,*
*as if they were a nation that did righteousness*
*and did not forsake the judgment of their God;*
*they ask of me righteous judgments;*
*they delight to draw near to God.*

The Israelites act as if they were a righteous nation. They pray, fast, tithe and read the Bible, but they are missing the whole point. Holiness and sinfulness do not go together. If they want to draw near to God, they need to withdraw from their sins. 
In the next verses their sins are mentioned. These are sins of the past, a prediction, I think, of Isaiah about the 400 years before the coming of the Messiah. But even today, we see the "good" things Jews are doing, while holding on to their sins, in business, in "religion"—that is, morality #todo/opzoeken  what's the word?—

*3 Why have we fasted, and you see it not?*
*Why have we humbled ourselves, and you take no knowledge of it?’*
*Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure,*
*and oppress all your workers.*
*4 Behold, you fast only to quarrel and to fight*
*and to hit with a wicked fist.*

* These are the sins of the Jews. 
* They seek their own pleasure. 
* They oppress all their workers.
* They quarrel and fight.
 * Perhaps even: the reason they fast is to compensatie for all fights, so that they can continue with that behavior. 
* Or it could mean: they even fight about what the right way of fasting is.

They do not realize the reason for fasting. It is not to withhold oneself from food alone, but to truly repent from one's sins, to stay peaceful, to withhold oneself even from pleasure such as entertainment, smoking—even if they were healthy—and sex. I would say even sports, if that is what gives you fun. 
It is to realize how bad we have been and still are and that only Jesus' atonement on the cross is enough for our sins. For the Jews who did not and do not know Jesus, it is at least realizing that their atonement through animal sacrifices is not enough for their sin, otherwise a fast would never be needed, but only offers at the altar every week and year. 

*Fasting like yours this day*
*will not make your voice to be heard on high.*
*5 Is such the fast that I choose,*
*a day for a person to humble himself?*
*Is it to bow down his head like a reed,*
*and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?*
*Will you call this a fast,*
*and a day acceptable to the Lord?*
::*6 “Is not this the fast that I choose:*::
::*to loose the bonds of wickedness,*::
::*to undo the straps of the yoke,*::
::*to let the oppressed go free,*::
::*and to break every yoke?*::

God does not accept the standard external way of fasting in itself. He looks at the heart, because from it there will be external expressions described in verses 6 and 7. I was immediately thinking of the people of Nineveh. Jonah did not describe what the Ninevites did to release the yoke of their slaves and the poor in their city. He only described their external way of fasting and mourning. 
But it is not a matter of order only. If one is truly repenting, the external will come. In other words, God knew that the Ninevites would change their ways.

::*7 Is it not to share your bread with the hungry*::
::*and bring the homeless poor into your house;*::
::*when you see the naked, to cover him,*::
::*and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?*:: #biblestudy/memorization/todo
*8 Then shall your light break forth like the dawn,*
*and your healing shall spring up speedily;*
*your righteousness shall go before you;*
*the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard.*

There is some healing effect when you share your house with the needy, the homeless and the poor, or your bread with the hungry. The world calls it buying off one's conscience, and depending on the intent it is as such, but the effect of it is written in verse 8, it like light breaking forth like the dawn and fast healing. How often have we not heard of examples where people give away what they have for the poor and God repays them with blessings. The story of a *Christmas Carol* by Charles Dickens is a testimony of this. Though the story was made up, like any other story, its motives and theme are based on real motives and themes. 
Scrooge was giving because he was afraid to become a lonely man, to die without people at his grave, to see others die because of his greed, but most of all, he felt guilty. It is the wrong motive to give. He should have given because God commanded so, or at least the spirit should have shown him what would have happened if he had given the money. He would then see the laughter of people and because he would love people—after Jesus loved him first—he would give money to bless them.
The story of Zaccheus is very similar—or should I say, Scrooge's story is similar to his'? But it is morally more correct than Dickens' version, because Zaccheus is not giving out of feelings of guilt or fear, but because he realizes what true love is and feels like when he experienced it from Jesus Himself. Now that he has felt it, he wants everyone to feel this as well. #church/material
With the love came also his freedom of and love for money. One cannot love both God and money (cf. Matthew #todo/opzoeken ). In Scrooge's life, however, I do not see where he received the loved to change his life. He was motivated by fear (not fear for God, for a selfish fear, for his own life) which made him give his money, but after seeing the smiling faces of children, his heart changed. Love for other people replaced his love for money and himself, which made him generous. 

*9 Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer;*
*you shall cry, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’*
*If you take away the yoke from your midst,*
*the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness,*
*10 if you pour yourself out for the hungry*
*and satisfy the desire of the afflicted,*
*then shall your light rise in the darkness*
*and your gloom be as the noonday.*

I must be careful here that I do not confuse the reader with an incorrect order of the process of salvation. The Gospel says that it is God Who chose us first and out of those chosen some would respond and out of those who respond, God will touch their hearts, forgive them and these people will have a change of heart and their ways. So it is God Who acts first. 
In verse 9 too the people call—I assume they call out to God—but God had chosen them before, for there are some who did not call out to God. God responds, but what happens afterwards is not in the same order as the Gospel. Perhaps that is because the Messiah Jesus Christ had not come yet. 
But God says: "if you pour yourself out...*then* shall your light rise". So the order in the Old Testament, although I do not suppose the effect of it in the New Testament period will be any different, is that you cry out to God and that He will tell you to stop your wicked ways first. If you want to experience freedom, then stop your unrighteousness towards the poor and hungry.
If we want to experience the light that Isaiah describes here, whether you believe in Christ or not, you must stop your evil ways in order to fully enjoy living in the light.
Now I heard the story of a prostitute who came to Christ but could not immediately stop her work (I guess it is because of an ownership of her pimp, in a sense lots of these women are treated as slaves). Did she then see the light? If she actually believed in Christ, then yes, she would have seen the light, but every time a customer would come by, the light would be harder for her to see. 
Note that Isaiah is not only talking about evil things as we perceive them. He is also talking about pointing a finger, putting a yoke on people, speaking wickedness. One of the first things that comes up to me is the way of living commanded in the (Dutch) Reformed Church and other more orthodox denominations—I mean, the corrupted way of living. People gossip, they give rules that are not commanded in the Bible, the exclude people and they exclude love. Does this not exactly describe verse 9? 
The second thing would be the government. It is putting an unnecessary yoke on people through its taxes, it is speaking wickedness of "scientific" discoveries such as the climate change, evolution, that gender is not related to sex, and about whether fetuses are living creatures or not and keeping quiet on their suffering.

*11 And the Lord will guide you continually*
*and satisfy your desire in scorched places*
*and make your bones strong;*
*and you shall be like a watered garden,*
*like a spring of water,*
*whose waters do not fail.*

After this, after you have done the good you are supposed to do, and after yo have stopped the unrighteousness you were not supposed to do, the Lord will guide you continually. Mark the word "continually", for in the previous verse I have explained that the Lord can guide you even if you are living in sin. Rather yet, it is the case for everyone who once lived in sin that they were guided by the Lord to get out of this life of sin. However, He will not guide you *continually*, which is what we long for. 
God satisfies your desire in scorched places. Can you imagine a place that is scorched? A place where the ground is so hard you cannot even easily put your shovel in it, where the water will not go into the ground, but flows *on* it until it finds a crack into it may seep. Nothing grows there, there is nothing to eat or drink. Nothing lives there except for some insects who can survive for years without water, and animals who eat these insects, or animals who drink the dew out of their fur. It is almost impossible to imagine how anyone can be satisfied in such a place. It would be even worse than a desert like the Sahara, where there is at least water under the ground, and where there are animals, and sand in which plants can plant their roots, and which comes to life after a rainfall, and where there are oases. 
No, a scorched place is a place where nothing grows, like the Dead Valley, although that valley is dead because of the salt located there. But it is just as dead. 
God can satisfy innumerable ways, without food or materials. God can sustain life without it, as He had done so with Elijah, who ran for forty days and nights (not even clear whether he had breaks or sleep) without food and water. Before that He gave Elijah fresh water through a spring #todo/opzoeken and food through ravens. Whichever way God uses, it is a miracle. So even in a scorched place you can be satisfied with these miracles with or without food. The biggest miracle of all, which is the biggest gift, is faith in Him. If we can have faith that God will provide in such a scorched place, then we are the luckiest men on Earth. For what is a man without faith? He is without hope. And without hope, no man can live or should live. 

About the bones. This is such an important symbol Isaiah is using. Do you know what it feels like to have strong bones? You will realize as soon as you realize your bones have become weak. You might think how it is possible to have feelings in your bones, for bones do not have nerves, but yet they affect every part of your body surrounding it. Perhaps the bones themselves do not have nerves, but around it are tendons and tissue that get pulled by the slightest movement of the bones. 
Maybe the reason why it hurts so much is because one cannot get hold of it. A pain caused by some tissue can be isolated, by injecting with an anesthetic, or by cutting it off, or something else. But when it concerns bones it is more difficult to isolate the pain. Furthermore broken and sharp bones could cause more damage with every movement. 
#todo/opzoeken See also the notes on the passage concerning bones in Psalms.
A person with strong bones, however, feels like he is invincible. That is why young people are so reckless, because—even if they have broken bones before, they have healed and they do not feel the pain anymore—they feel their bones are strong. 
I myself as well have the feeling I could jump off a three meter high wall. But after I would have done such a thing and feel the pain in my knees, I would not do such a thing a second time. 
Now God is not giving us the vain idea of being able to do anything, but rather the feeling that we are strong, although this strength is from him. The feeling of strength and confidence allows us to do so much more. We just need to realize that is not we who are strong, and that we are not supposed to have confidence in ourselves for our strength, but in God Who is strong through us. 

Now about the watered garden, this too is a symbol of plentifulness #todo/opzoeken abundance. A watered garden is a luxury one can only have when water is present in abundance. In Israel you can hardly speak of "watering" your garden. It is not with a hose or a bucket. The leaves are not wet nor do you visible see wet soil or a rainbow, let alone those Japanse Zen Buddhism or *Feng Shui*-like artifacts, such as running water through bamboo sticks and fountains. No, these would allow too much evaporation in a climate as Israel's where water is scarce. 
Instead, the amount water needed is measured up to milliliters exactly and dropped into the ground. The fields are covered with a mesh-kind of cloth that allows enough sunlight but blocks out most of the wind and keeps it cooler than outside of this mesh to minimize excessive evaporation. 
No, I would not call those watered gardens. They do not look like they have been watered, even though they are. 
But aside from what they look like, the difference between a watered garden and an insufficiently watered garden is that the latter barely bears any fruit, or smaller fruit than the abundantly watered garden, because it has not had enough nutrients because of the lack of water, which carries nutrients from the soil into the roots.  

*12 And your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt;*
*you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;*
*you shall be called the repairer of the breach,*
*the restorer of streets to dwell in.*

The context in which we are reading these verses is where Israel has dried out, spiritually, morally, materially, and so forth. But historically they have dried out as well. God is showing them the importance of history. All the knowledge God gave them, innovation and wisdom, was to make life more abundant, more enjoyable for His people. How much more can we enjoy life now we can spend less time on cleaning with all the household machines we have at home? How much further can we travel with new and faster modes of transportations such as airplanes, magnetic trains and later on the *Hyper Loop*? 
But aside from technology, there is so much ancient wisdom that goes lost if people do not pay attention to that. In the *Maslow* pyramid this knowledge and wisdom would indeed be at a lower place. Who care about poetry, commands and moral values when one is starving? Or in other words, who cares about God's Word, written in the Bible, in such a situation? Apparently not many, 
Maslow's pyramid may be a description of human practice, but it is not a *prescription*. It is not how we *should* live. God has always wanted us to put His Word and His commands first, starting with fearing and loving the Lord our God, and with it obtaining intrinsic moral values and love for others, as well as inheriting His characteristics and the Fruit of the Spirit (cf. Galatians 5:22). 

::*13 “If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath,*::
::*from doing your pleasure on my holy day,*::
::*and call the Sabbath a delight*::
::*and the holy day of the Lord honorable;*::
::*if you honor it, not going your own ways,*::
::*or seeking your own pleasure, or talking idly;*::

It is clear that God is speaking to the Israelites here, for He refers to Jacob as their father. Here as well, the Sabbath is mentioned as prerequisite to take delight in the Lord. This time it is mentioned more explicitly that one must call the Sabbath a *delight* and *honorable*. It is more concrete about what to do on that holy day, namely not to seek one's own pleasure or talking idly.
#todo/opzoeken was the term "the holy day" used in revelations as well?

It is clear what one's own pleasure is, it is entertainment in any form without the worship of God. It is meant for us, that is what is wrong, because this day should be meant for God. Talking idly is like talking with friends about stuff that does not build up the relation. 
It is hard to exactly define what idle means then, because it is good if a man and his wife talk communicate at all. Some things may be left out, such as what groceries to buy or how to finance their mortgage, these things do not necessarily build up the relation and should not be discussed on the holy day of the Lord.

*14 then you shall take delight in the Lord,*

Taking delight in the Lord could mean two things. It could mean that one can enjoy God's presence, that is that is able to take delight in the Lord. Not everyone is able to do that. The demons called "Legion" in the possessed man were terrified in the presence of Jesus, they definitely did not take delight in God. The Bible says that some cannot stand the light #todo/opzoeken  het licht verdragen. 
But in order to be able to take delight in the Lord, one must honor the Sabbath. This does not simply mean that one must rest on that day. No, as explained before, it means that one must reserve that day for personal contact with His Savior—and to do that, it means that one must believe in Him and have accepted Him as His God and Savior first. In other words, one must become a Jew or Christian first. 
The second meaning is that God will bless you and therefore you will take delight in Him. The difference between the first and the second meaning is that in the first meaning you were blessed, but you could not stand his blessing and His light. In the second meaning you did not have this blessing before. 
In a sense both meanings are true. The Israelites did not have God's blessing, but whenever He gave them a chance to see a bit about Himself, they could not see Him. They only saw the sacrifice they had to make, that they had to change their ways and give up their riches. They were not like the Ninevites in Jonah's age, who fearfully and willingly accepted God's command. 

*and I will make you ride on the heights of the earth;*

I would not know what riding on the heights of the earth means, #biblestudy/questions Isaiah probably means the mountains by heights, but what blessing is there in riding (on a horse, for example) on a mountain. Is it the feeling of flying, freedom that is? The Israelites were not supposed to have horses, but riding on donkeys or camels, I assume, would not give the same experience. 

*I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father,*
*for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.”*

The heritage of Jacob was different for each son, but the general heritage was the relationship with God and the land of Israel. That, however, is not meant, I suppose, when God is saying that the Israelites are *fed* with it. I would rather say that it is the life lessons that Jacob has learned and which have made him a man of God, putting God first in his life.
The relationships the patriarchs had, was unique in the sense that they had an intimate relationship with God and heard him—physically, I suppose—multiple times. Abraham talked, bargained and ate with God, and Jacob dreamt about and fought with God. 
This unique relationship was meant for the Jews as well. Instead, no one came near the tent outside of the #todo/opzoeken barakken, official name? 
where Moses resided. Were they allowed to enter it, or was it only meant for Moses? I do not know. #biblestudy/questions but the least they could have done was to do like Joshua did and pray outside of and next to it. The reason for their fear might have been the fear mentioned above, they could not delight in the presence of God, like Moses and Joshua could, because of their iniquity. #church/material
