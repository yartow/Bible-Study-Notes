# Isaiah 65
**Judgment and Salvation**
*1 I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for me;*
*I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me.*
*I said, “Here I am, here I am,”*
*to a nation that was not called by my name.*

God was ready, He was available. It was not too late back then. But what happened? The people were not asking for Him, they were not seeking Him, and they were not carrying His Name. 
This really brings up the image of children who have come to leave their parents and do not recognize them anymore. They have completely forgotten about them and even when the parent comes back and yells at them in their face "Here I am", then still they are being ignored. 
There are a number of movies about parents paying a detective to find back a child who does not want to be found by his parents, who left his parents on purpose. Coming most to mind is that of Michael Douglas in the movie *Traffic*.
In all cases there was a bad relationship between the child and his parents, usually due to a combination of external influences and bad parenting. But what has God done wrong here? Nothing. It is completely our fault for running away and not wanting to have anything to deal with Him. Our only objective is, unlike that of children in the movies who are looking for some kind of attention, because we want freedom. Not freedom as defined by God, but defined as doing what we want without the consequences. In other words, becoming God ourselves. 

*2 I spread out my hands all the day*
*to a rebellious people,*
*who walk in a way that is not good,*
*following their own devices;*

God spreading His hands over us, is His protection. Without His protection we would not be able to live a single millisecond. The very instance we would die—not even of the devil, but because nothing would uphold the micro-processes occurring in our cells. A cell is dead matter, consisting of merely molecules. There is no such thing as living matter. We would all collapse.
The ironic thing is, even collapsing implies that there is such a thing as gravity and the law gravity as well as all other laws of nature are upheld by God. 
But God is protecting us all the time while we deserve to die, while we rebel. What we do is not good, our motivation is not good—we do it only for ourselves. The verses below only indicate more details of we are doing wrong. What reason does God have to not take His hands away from us? 
His love and mercy are the only two reasons. He *is* in fact the reason, for He *is* love and mercy itself. 
Does this imply that he *cannot* take His hands away? No. His mercy has limits and though the Bible says His love knows no limits, that is in the context of forgiveness. It means that no matter how much a person has sinned, God is willing to forgive this person all of his sins. But when a person will never repent, why should God take any effort in protecting him? 

*3 a people who provoke me*
*to my face continually,*
*sacrificing in gardens*
*and making offerings on bricks;*

What these persons are doing is against God Himself. They are provoking Him. If they could, they would kill God. Why should God hold His hands over people that are trying to destroy Him? Would love even rationalize that? 
A child who steals from his father, perhaps for some drug addiction, and a father who is willing to lay down his life for his son, so that he can be healed, that is rational. There are stories where a father is willing to go to jail for his son, so that his son may be set free, free from drugs and criminality, even when it was his son who stole from him. 
But God knows the outcome of every situation. If a person is not willing to change his life and be grateful for all that God has done, why should God waste His efforts in protecting them and let these people hurt and influence others while they are protected by God? Would God not be aiding His own "demise" by letting these people live? 
This is a difficult question, it is the same as one of the most often asked questions: "Why would a good God allow evil?" The answer is the same. It is for the sake of love, and love is dependent on free choice. 
God has given these bad people free choice to sin, He must also give them free choice to repent. God does not *have* to do anything, He can also give them one year to repent and then let them perish and God would still be in His right. But God chooses to save a many people as He can. 
I think God has calculated this. If He allows the bad people to live for one year, they will cause `a` destruction, where `a` is the number of people not believing in God, causing `b` people to and the number of remaining good people will be `1-b`f. But if He allows them to live for ten years, then the bad people will cause `a'` destruction, but `b` people will repent
In short, there is maximum where most people will have repented or not fallen for evil. At that time, God will let the evil people perish. Perhaps though, God does not measure in the number of people but in another (to us) abstract measure, which could be a combination of sin against nature, human and God. 

*4 who sit in tombs,*
*and spend the night in secret places;*
*who eat pig's flesh,*
*and broth of ::tainted meat:: is in their vessels;*

#biblestudy/questions What is tainted meat? 
No matter what these secret places or tainted meat are, it is certain that this is against God's clear instructions. 
These tombs are the places of the dead and the Israelites most likely worshipped a god and performed a ritual by spending the night with the dead. Why would the Israelites be willing to go to such lengths, doing such fearful things which are not logical, to worship a god who does not even claim to help them completely? What is the rationale or even feeling behind this? I do not understand. 
God claims to be our healer, our savior, Who forgives us of all our sin. This means that we will not be sick anymore, no longer prisoners of addictions or other peoples and we do not have to feel guilty but may have hope, respectively. 
God asked the Israelites to perform rituals, of cleansing themselves, of cooking the fat off of the meat before eating or sacrificing it, to tithe and a number of other ceremonial and hygienic practices. All of these had advantages though. These rituals were often fun, such as the celebrations of Pesach and Yom Kippur. 
So in other words, the gods of other nations are not logical and ask big sacrifices from their followers and offer them little to nothing of spiritual value. God, on the other hand, is logical (even when we do not understand Him requests we often understand them later on), usually does not ask us the impossible and gives us more than anything else could in this whole universe. Rather yet, the reason why people come to faith is because only at God's feet can they find what they were looking for, i.e. hope, faith, love, compassion. 

*5 who say, “Keep to yourself,*
*do not come near me, for I am too holy for you.”*

At a certain point people become so arrogant that they even dare say to their creator that they are too holy for them. How is this possible? 
The Japanese are a bit different from Western cultures in that they have the utmost respect for their elders and forefathers. They worship them not *as if* their forefathers are gods, but they *actually* worship them as gods. The Japanese have this characteristic that a student can never be better than the teacher. But when he becomes better, he must prove this and kill his teacher in a fight—at least, this is the way in martial arts. There is no other way to prove this. Perhaps it is because his teacher feels the shame of having someone better than he. 
One one hand this is a good trait of the Japanese. The student, who has now become the teacher, will always be respectful of his teacher and never let anyone blemish his name. A good student knows that everything he knows and, is taught and given by his teacher. It is not only a teacher-student relationship, but almost a father-son relationship. 
In the West, however, it is not a shame to be beaten by someone else. Everyone is better at something, and even when one is not, it still is not a shame because that does not diminish one's worth. This person is still able to help others *for God*. Being the best only has value for oneself. In other words, it is a selfish thought to aim to be the best in the world. Japanese in that sense are very selfish, most likely because of their Buddhist roots for in Buddhism it is ultimately all about oneself as well. 
As for aiming for the best, it is for this reason that Eric Liddel forfeited his chance to run in the Olympics, because he wanted to honor God. It is all about God.
Back to my example, if we take the best of both worlds, we should learn from the Japanese to always put ourselves under our Creator and Teacher, which is Jesus and God, but also learn from the West that it is not about us but about God. 

*These are a smoke in my nostrils,*
*a fire that burns all the day.*

It is funny to see that the Greeks use this term as something good. Zeus wanted to have smoke in his nostrils but because he could not smell the offer of King Midas he punished him for it by letting his wife fall in love with the bull the king was supposed to offer. 
God, on the other hand, detests this scent or actual smoke in His nostrils. Those who hate smoking or those who have stood above burning coals, know how irritating this smoke is. Those who have been in farmlands know that farms, stubs or trees are burnt for several reasons, but this smoke can be smelled all day long and even after you leave it, it is in one's clothes. 

*6 Behold, it is written before me:*
*“I will not keep silent, but I will repay;*
*I will indeed repay into their lap*
*7 both your iniquities and your fathers' iniquities together,*
*says the Lord;*
*because they made offerings on the mountains*
*and insulted me on the hills,*
*I will measure into their lap*
*payment for their former deeds.”*

God will repay as He has always done. *MacSBNnkjv* writes that God does take action here, not by delivering the Israelites, but by punishing those who insulted Him. 
#biblestudy/questions why are the father's iniquities repaid into their lap as well? Aren't individuals supposed to be punished for their own sins only? 
Who is "their"? Why does God use "their" and "your" interchangeably? It seems as if "their" are the enemies and "your" are the Israelites, however, the Israelites sometimes were the enemy of their own people. 
Is God going to punish the Israelites or the other peoples? 

*8 Thus says the Lord:*
::*“As the new wine is found in the cluster,*::
::*and they say, ‘Do not destroy it,*::
::*for there is a blessing in it,’*::
::*so I will do for my servants' sake,*::
::*and not destroy them all.*::

New wine has the property that it will yeast, which means there is still sugar in it and it has potential to create a stronger wine with more alcohol. Perhaps the people of those days did not like weak wines, perhaps the wine was rotten due to the heat. But even rotten wine can still be turned into something else, as long as there is alcohol in it. One can make vodka from it, or perhaps even port or whiskey-like products. 

*9 I will bring forth offspring from Jacob,*
*and from Judah possessors of my mountains;*
*my chosen shall possess it,*
*and my servants shall dwell there.*

God was able to create something from nothing, can He not bring the potential out of Jacob? 
God is also mentioning here that His servants will even dwell there. God's servants are probably the same people as the aforementioned *chosen*. In fact, everyone who recognizes God as god must be His servant. It is by definition I would say. Just like when one says "master" to a person then by definition you are his servant, otherwise one would not call him that way. 

*10 Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks,* 
*and the ::Valley of Achor:: a place for herds to lie down,*
*for my people who have sought me.*

I remember now that Sharon appears in Song of Songs as well, probably the only time in the Bible it is mentioned next to this place in Isaiah. More specifically, it mentions the Rose of Sharon, which, according to David Pawson, is a very small flower, nearly invisible, hidden in the shadow of valleys. 
The area it is located in, as with most of Israel, is dry, just like the Valley of Achor, which except for its drought is also cursed. But both here and in Joel, God promises that the valley of Achor will be fruitful again. 
When God promises something it is for certain that it will happen; when He promises something twice it is even more definite, even though that is impossible. 

*11 But you who forsake the Lord,*
*who forget my holy mountain,*
*who set a table for Fortune*
*and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny,*
*12 I will destine you to the sword,*
*and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter,*
*because, when I called, you did not answer;*
*when I spoke, you did not listen,*
*but you did what was evil in my eyes*
*and chose what I did not delight in.”*

#biblestudy/questions What is mixed wine? Is it wine mixed with herbs or wine mixed with water? 
The people described here are not only people who sinned, unconsciously. Not, they forsook God! They forgot about a holy mountain. How can anyone forget about a holy mountain? It is right in front of you, for those who live near it. The proof of it is in the Ark of the Covenant. It is where all these rules and rituals came from. At least the High Priests who have been in the Holy of Holies and who have seen all the attributes, should have more faith and proof of everything. I doubt whether they have seen the attributes in the Ark itself, but regardless, all of the other attributes should be convincing enough. 
And not only did the Israelites decide to not follow God anymore, like so many do in the West in this age, but they decided to follow other gods.
And if that was not enough, God even called them and spoke to them and still they did not listen. When God says something like this, it really means that the people have no excuse in not being able to hear or interpret whether something was from God or not. 
It is like the people did everything that was completely the opposite of what God longed for. They walked away from Him and did what He did not want them to do, they followed whom God did not want them to follow.

*13 Therefore thus says the Lord God:*
*“Behold, my servants shall eat,*
*but you shall be hungry;*
*behold, my servants shall drink,*
*but you shall be thirsty;*
*behold, my servants shall rejoice,*
*but you shall be put to shame;*
*14 behold, my servants shall sing for gladness of heart,*
*but you shall cry out for pain of heart*
*and shall wail for breaking of spirit.*

Because the Israelites (though not all of them) did exactly the opposite of what God wanted them to do, now God treats them in exactly the opposite way of how He treats His servants. 

*15 You shall leave your name to my chosen for a curse,*
*and the Lord God will put you to death,*
*but his servants he will call by another name,*
*16 so that he who blesses himself in the land*
*shall bless himself by the God of truth,*
*and he who takes an oath in the land*
*shall swear by the God of truth;*
*because the former troubles are forgotten*
*and are hidden from my eyes.*

In this world, God’s name is used as an oath, but all too often it is used disrespectful and we even call is cursing in Dutch, when the Name of God is used in vain. No one, however, ever uses the names of other “gods” such as Buddha, Allah or Shiva in a negative way. But God promises us that the names of God’s enemies will be used for a curse and His servants will be called by another name. 
Currently indeed, the term “Christians” does not amount to much. Not only could it mean anything from Catholic and Orthodox to Evangelical across the whole spectrum of Christianity, but also does it adhere—or so most people think—to everyone brought up in this religion, believing in this God or everyone who simply *says* he believes—just like anyone can say he *believes* he is a woman and is then considered one. No, God wants us to be more than that and the name of Christ that we Christians bear has been defiled. Now truly believing Christians all over the world are coming up with new names to distinguish themselves from other people who call themselves Christians. Born-again Christians was one of these terms, but that term as well has been corrupted. Even Michael Schermer, famed sceptic, atheist, proponent of naturalistic Darwinistic evolution and founder of Sceptic #todo/opzoeken/engels spelling magazine, even says he was a born-again Christian. If that is the case, how can a born-again Christian, one who has laid down his old life, regretted all of his mistakes, pick up his old life again and “un-regret” the things he has done? Apparently he was not born again then, because when one realizes, he cannot un-realize something. 

**New Heavens and a New Earth**
*17 “For behold, I create new heavens*
*and a new earth,*
*and the former things shall not be remembered*
*or come into mind.*
*18 But be glad and rejoice forever*
*in that which I create;*
*for behold, I create Jerusalem to be a joy,*
*and her people to be a gladness.*
*19 I will rejoice in Jerusalem*
*and be glad in my people;*
*no more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping*
*and the cry of distress.*

When the Bible says that no old man will not fill out his days, this means that no person will feel like he has not done all he wanted to do in life. This is because young men will stay young and die at a 100 years old, so they have enough vigor and time to do everything.
Would it be contradictory to have death on the New Earth? It would probably be then death without weeping. Where would the soul then go to and what would it do? What would the whole purpose be of these souls?
The purpose of us is to worship God and for that we need to be with God. We cannot be completely with God now, but we will in heaven. After this Earth has been cleansed God will put us back on this Earth (or another one) in order to do things with our new physical bodies which we probably could not have done in heaven.
But if our souls are made for eternity, why would there be death on the New Earth? It does not make sense.
Will our souls then go back to heaven once more? For what purpose, to be with God? We were already as close to God as we could get. #biblestudy/questions Could it be true that this part is speaking of the New Earth, not as in the New Earth coming after the cleaning of the Old Earth, but the Millennium #tags/theology/endtimes/millenium starting after Christ's Second Advent? It seems rather illogical to me, that Christ would come a second time and then rule as a King here for a thousand years. He would then rule with the iron scepter and judge between those who are for or against Him. Furthermore, the laws of physics would not fully apply because men stay young and die older. 
Even if a day is like a thousand years then still there is a limit to how long we can live on this New Earth.

*20 No more shall there be in it*
*an infant who lives but a few days,*
*or an old man who does not fill out his days,*
*for the young man shall die a hundred years old,*
*and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed.*

*21 They shall build houses and inhabit them;*
*they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.*
*22 They shall not build and another inhabit;*
*they shall not plant and another eat;*
*for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be,*
*and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.*

These two remarks in verses 21 and 22 have been mentioned before in Isaiah and most likely in other parts of the Old Testament as well. It is of utter importance that those who work will receive what they have been working for. Both materially as well as spiritually this is one of the themes in the New Testament, see for example the parable of the landowner and the wages. 
This principle or theme too is incorporated in the Constitution of the United States and in fact abolishes slavery as defined that time, that is that the fruit of the hand will be in the hands of the owner. Thus, the Constitution is—as we knew already—in line with the Bible and with "modern" moral values, although it is better to say that modern values are in line with the Bible's. 

*23 They shall not labor in vain*
*or bear children for calamity,*
*for they shall be the offspring of the blessed of the Lord,*
*and their descendants with them.*

God clearly describes situations here that still occur in time and which were very prevalent 50 years ago in Asia for example. Children were borne for calamities: the sons would provide workers and a pension for when the parents were old, the daughters would help out in the house and be married off, perhaps receiving a bridal treasure for it. Either way, the reason for bearing children will change. 
In short, when people are blessed by the Lord their *purpose* of living changes as does their behavior and actions. It cannot be otherwise. For God changes the circumstances and changes short-term vision to long-term actions.  #church/material

*24 Before they call I will answer;*
*while they are yet speaking I will hear.*

What a contrast this is with what we experience right now. The Israelites as well had extended periods where they could not hear God, because they had sinned too much, for example in the Sinai desert, in period of the Judges and right now in the period of the Divided Kingdom. 
Even in these days, where we have the Holy Spirit helping us speak His words and distinguish His words from the devil's, where the Holy Spirit speaks to us and our conscience, and we have the full canon of the Scriptures, still we do not always hear God. 
But now God promises us not only that this period will be over and that we will receive His answer, He takes it one step further, as usual, and says that He will answer even before we have called! 
He will also hear us while we are speaking. This might not seem like anything special, because we literally all do that. But hearing in this context means something else of course. It means: "I have heard what you said, and I will grant your request."
How could one grant another's request when he has not even finished hearing the other? We know king Xerxes did such a thing for Esther, although that most likely was hyperbole when he promised up to half of his kingdom, and king Herod (though actually not a king, but a mere tetrarch) did the same for Salome, Heriodas' daughter, who (Herodias) was his niece as well. We also know what happened to king Herod and that he had to keep his word, though he did not want to. 
There it is a big thing for God to say, especially because He cannot break neither His word nor His moral values (although in God's case these are more than just "values", it is His identity). So God would only say such a thing when He knows that the other is not going to request anything outside of God's reach. #church/material

*25 The wolf and the lamb shall graze together;*
*the lion shall eat straw like the ox,*
*and dust shall be the serpent's food.*
*They shall not hurt or destroy*
*in all my holy mountain,”*
*says the Lord.*

Enemies will eat together. That is what this first line means. Now grazing for an animal is not the same as eating for mankind. For human beings food brings people together—not so for animals. However, in the case of verse 25 the lamb *is* the wolf's food, when they get together and *graze*, that is even a bigger step to accomplish then for human enemies to come together and eat.
What surprises me is that the serpent still eats dust, as was promised by a curse to the serpent in Genesis 3, but which is still not a "good" thing, it seems. On the other hand, the serpent's curse would most likely not be reversed or removed. #biblestudy/questions It is far better, however, than serpents eating other animals.
Either way, nothing, no animal nor human, shall be hurt.
