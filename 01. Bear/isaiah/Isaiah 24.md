**Isaiah 24 (NIV) The Lord’s Devastation of the Earth**
*1 See, the Lord is going to lay waste the earth*
*and devastate it;*
*he will ruin its face*
*and scatter its inhabitants—*
*2 it will be the same*
*for priest as for people,*
*for the master as for his servant,*
*for the mistress as for her servant,*
*for seller as for buyer,*
*for borrower as for lender,*
*for debtor as for creditor.*

In the final days, the literal last days of the Earth the Earth is going to laid waste. Many people will die and those alive will not be bothered rebuild the Earth, but are only trying to stay alive. 
In those last days everyone will be equal. Perhaps this is because of the digitization of everything, including digital currency. If passports are digital as well as bank accounts and everything gets deleted, our whole human identity is gone. Of course a professor still knows more than a layman, but in those dire situations of war everyone is equal and everyone suffers just as much. 

*3 The earth will be completely laid waste*
*and totally plundered.*
*The Lord has spoken this word.*
*4 The earth dries up and withers,*
*the world languishes and withers,*
*the heavens languish with the earth.*
*5 The earth is defiled by its people;*
*they have disobeyed the laws,*
*violated the statutes*
*and broken the everlasting covenant.*
*6 Therefore a curse consumes the earth;*
*its people must bear their guilt.*
*Therefore earth’s inhabitants are burned up,*
*and very few are left.*

One might think that God's curse is going too far. He is destroying this beautiful Earth, everything He created with His Almighty Word, with details perhaps outspoken for every atom to form into small molecules and small molecules into bigger ones such as amino acids and eventually proteins and God's masterpiece of DNA. 
No, God is not destroying all of this beauty. God is cleaning up what man has destroyed. It is not so much the environment and nature that man has destroyed through pollution and destruction of rain forests, for that can be restored, but it is the major footprint of sin that man has left on this Earth for next generations. Erected statues for idol worship imprinted everywhere. Where God told us to impress His Law on our children in Deuteronomy 5, we have impressed idolatry instead on them. 
Generation after generation we have allowed movie stars, movies and songs allowed to perpetrate our culture which through Hollywood in the beginning of the previous century has caused materialism and infidelity to be more widely accepted, which through Elvis Presley and the Beatles led to the sexual revolution and incarnation if you will of New Age. Not merely *influences* of New Age, but the New Age itself is present in the West. 

We are the ones who have destroyed not only nature, but brought sin and not withheld but even increased sin into this world, in every field. 
Not only mortality wise, but even into science man has brought up sin to make science prove that God does not exist and that man can make up its own rules, in short, be their own god. 

Man cannot save even his own life, provide for their own happiness. How then does it think it can be God? 
It keeps thinking, if I do this, I might become happy. And that is exactly the point. They are thinking this, they do not even know. And even if they know what will not make them happy and satisfied, they still do it, because it is they only way they can get see. 
Like a heroin user knows that its satisfaction is only temporary and afterwards brings an even deeper unhappiness and dissatisfaction, people still use it because they have no better way. But still they think they are God and that they know what is best for them. 

*7 The new wine dries up and the vine withers;*
*all the merrymakers groan.*
*8 The joyful timbrels are stilled,*
*the noise of the revelers has stopped,*
*the joyful harp is silent.*
*9 No longer do they drink wine with a song;*
*the beer is bitter to its drinkers.*
*10 The ruined city lies desolate;*
*the entrance to every house is barred.*
*11 In the streets they cry out for wine;*
*all joy turns to gloom,*
*all joyful sounds are banished from the earth.*
*12 The city is left in ruins,*
*its gate is battered to pieces.*
*13 So will it be on the earth*
*and among the nations,*
*as when an olive tree is beaten,*
*or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest.*

This is only a glimpse and a brief description of what the Earth will look like in those days. It is referring to two events, that of the coming of the Assyrians, but to the events at the Apocalypse as well, which will be far worse. 
Yes, it is mankind's own mistake. A mistake is a heavy understatement for what man has done to Earth and its people.
*Surely some peoples or nations have not hurt the environment as much as the west, like Indians and aboriginals*, you might think, but unfortunately that is not the case. It is sometimes in those cultures where the worst atrocities are taking place. I have read of native cultures where mothers marry their sons and father their daughters. Where sodomy is accepted and boys need to perform fellatio, on older men and swallow their semen. The devil is at work here and has created a culture in which even daily things abhor God.
So, no, not only the West is infiltrated with sin. It is everywhere, but each culture sins in different ways. 

*14 They raise their voices, they shout for joy;*
*from the west they acclaim the Lord’s majesty.*
*15 Therefore in the east give glory to the Lord;*
*exalt the name of the Lord, the God of Israel,*
*in the islands of the sea.*
*16 From the ends of the earth we hear singing:*
*“Glory to the Righteous One.”*
*But I said, “I waste away, I waste away!*
*Woe to me!*
*The treacherous betray!*
*With treachery the treacherous betray! ”*

Will it help when the whole world then raises their voice and praises God? They will finally do so, perhaps not even so that they might escape death, but because they have finally seen God. Atheists ask for a miracle, a proof that is so irrefutable that God exists, before they will believe in such a god. God had already given them the proof they needed, just look at the many books written about creation and evolution, refuting science and its anti-theistic religion behind it. But that was not enough, and most people did not even bother reading this material, or even reading materials by philosophers such as Bertrand Russel, or "scientists" such as Stephen Hawking and Richard Dawkins. 
Now God has given them His ultimate proof, by taking away everything they had and showing His Almight and power. He has shown He can destroy the whole world with one breath, it is as easy as that. And now people give Him praise for what He is, for what else can one do when he sees God or the hand of God? 
But this praise is a mere observation. It is like saying to the winner of a swimming competition, while you are the one who lost: "You are the winner."
Even if you are saying it grudgingly, you are saying the truth about him being the winner. It is a fact. 
When it comes to beauty that is a better example of forcibly praising someone. For beauty is often in the eye of the beholder. A beauty pageant contestant would say to the winner that she is the winner, but she probably would not say, I admit, you are more beautiful than I am. And quite truly, it is hard to distinguish between the beautiful women competing with each other. All of them are about as beautiful, hence the additional competitiveness on character, morality, wits and smarts and intelligence, which are not really elements of the competition, but should be. 
But in the case of God, when someone sees God, the most beautiful being not in the universe, for He created the universe, but in and outside of the universe, one cannot say anything but You are the winner, You are what real beauty is, You are really God.
Still, my question would then be, is that really praise or is it a mere observation? 
My contention is that the people still are not praising Him fully with their hearts. It is purely with their heads. Now they know it, but it is of less worth than when a person who has not see God praises Him. It is for this reason that Jesus said that happy are those who do not see and still believe. At least your actions are based on what is in your heart and not on what you see. #church/material

*17 Terror and pit and snare await you,*
*people of the earth.*
*18 Whoever flees at the sound of terror*
*will fall into a pit;*
*whoever climbs out of the pit*
*will be caught in a snare.*

God will make sure that humankind is punished. Just like He has promised in Deuteronomy 32 He is the One Who will take vengeance. 
#todo/opzoeken difference between vengeance and revenge.
So much He will do that He will create back-ups for when one of His plans fail, which they will not, but for the sake of argument, to show His wrath and His seriousness in this. 
He will *terrify* man, so they will become irrational and fall into traps, the *pits* referred to in this verse. Should they still be so reckless and arrogant to go against God's will, then He will catch them with a snare. 
I think the pit's function is not failing when people can climb out of it, but rather it is God allowing them to escape from it, in order to see those who defy Him and even His punishment, so that He can punish these "escapees" even harder. 

*The floodgates of the heavens are opened,*
*the foundations of the earth shake.*
*19 The earth is broken up,*
*the earth is split asunder,*
*the earth is violently shaken.*
*20 The earth reels like a drunkard,*
*it sways like a hut in the wind;*
*so heavy upon it is the guilt of its rebellion*
*that it falls —never to rise again.*

God controls the elements, the forces, of nature, such as rain, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and the wind. Whether by the laws of physics or not—for God need not abide by them—He can let these forces act so hard that they can destroy not only all of mankind, but the whole Earth as well. 
The hurricane in Haiti was nothing compared to what they could have been. If the tsunami had hit Haiti instead, nothing would be left of their houses and their infrastructure. The whole of Haiti, and I mean from the ground up, would then have to be rebuilt. 
But even the tsunami of 2005 #todo/opzoeken correct year? Which is worst?
was not the worst mankind has seen. This one went all the way to Somalia, and hit Sri Lanka on the way, both of which are heathen countries with pagan worship to their gods Buddha and Allah. God was angry, but not even at His top. 
The tsunami killed people, that's for sure, but material wise it was only some trees and houses that were destroyed. The volcanic eruption in Iceland caused air traffic delays and much economic damage. But what real damage was there? No serious damage that could not repaired in a short time. 
But God is talking here about the destruction of Earth, not of a city like Pompeii
which is already rare and magnificent, but major destructions that rip apart the Earth's crust, where people get sucked in the existing split and who countries disappear or get flooded, up till the highest mountains, like in time of Noah's flood. 
Even after this flood, that drastically changed the landscape of the Earth and caused major shapeshifting such as the Grand Canyon and masses of landslides spread from America to the UK, all across the Atlantic, the Earth was still inhabitable and restored to the beautiful Earth it is right now (in some parts of the world). 
There too we see that it was not necessary to destroy the world in order to get rid of sin, for man had not polluted the world in a way that we have already done. Nor had they left their marks of every kind of sin in this world, like we have on the internet, billboards and physical porn magazines. 
But that is what we *think*. The ancient people in Noah's time perhaps were worshipping fake gods already and had many idols that needed to be rid. God could have wiped all of humanity through a disease and spared Noah's family, but the traces of all pagan worship needed to be removed as well. 

Another question is what the use was of this flood if people were to sin again right after it. The answer is that Noah was the sole good person on this Earth. Before that Seth was the only good person and he was born long after Cain, after Cain had found a wife, after villages had begun to exist. So by the time Seth was an adult and started his own family, raising up children in a way God loved, the whole world was expanding rapidly. He had become the one percent that believed in God. #todo/opzoeken Number of people in the time of Seth and of Noah. How much between the two?
By the time Noah was born, Noah probably was the only one in the world, much less than one percent, and losing the battle for procreation of faithful people. God could only fix this—I am saying only out of ignorance for God has many more ways than I can imagine, but He chose this as the best way—by starting all over with mankind. 

After the flood it was now Noah who had a head-start. It was a battle he would be doomed to lose, but had God not done what He did in the Flood, we would not have been here, for the world would be 1600 years further than it is right now (for there were 1600 years from the time of Adam until Noah) and probably be finished by 400 AD, filled with so much evil that Jesus Christ would have had to come much earlier. 

*21 In that day the Lord will punish*
*the powers in the heavens above*
*and the kings on the earth below.*
*22 They will be herded together*
*like prisoners bound in a dungeon;*
*they will be shut up in prison*
*and be punished after many days.*

The greater powers of the earth and the people without power will be grouped together and be punished, each to his own responsibility. But what would those powers in the heavens above mean? Would they indicate the fake gods or in other words, the demons that are posing like gods? It is understandable that they get to be punished, but why would they be in the heavens *above*? 

*23 The moon will be dismayed,*
*the sun ashamed;*
*for the Lord Almighty will reign*
*on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,*
*and before its elders—with great glory.*

The Lord is already reigning, He already is the boss, the Master Who created everything. But not everyone knows this, as a matter of fact, most of the people do not know this and those call themselves Christian, about 2 billion—of which perhaps only ten percent is actually—only a small percentage *knows*, the rest merely believes this. 
But that is not enough. People need to *know* that Yahweh is God and that He reigns over *every* facet of life. He needs to do this *before* the people, especially before the elders, so that they can see God receiving all the glory and not them. 
It is just like Psalm 23, where David says: 
> You prepare a table before me, *in the presence* of my enemies.  
There is nothing as good as getting your revenge in this way. It is not we who need to get revenge, but God will do it for us and in a much better way than we could ever do.
