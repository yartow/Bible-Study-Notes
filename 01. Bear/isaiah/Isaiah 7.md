# Isaiah 7 
**(NIV) The Sign of Immanuel**
*1 When Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem, but they could not overpower it.*
*2 Now the house of David was told, “Aram has allied itself with Ephraim ”; so the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken, as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.*

Ahaz was afraid when he heard that two countries were going to attack him. I am not particularly sure how fear works in the human brain or in the soul, but I would think there is some kind of evaluation. One would think of questions like: *How big is my army, how big is theirs, can I win this, what have they achieved already?* 
As for the latter question, they could not overpower Jerusalem. Ahaz forgot about a lot of things. First of all, God is the God of Jerusalem, and He has always protected Jerusalem against forces of much greater multitude. Now granted, Ahaz had not seen the great miracle against Assyria yet, for that would occur three kings later during the reign of Hezekiah, but many great miracles had occurred years before that and could be read from the annals and otherwise the Bible as it was at that time.
But his faith was small. He did not think rationally (what has already been "achieved" by Jerusalem) nor did he think spiritually (what can God do for us). 
And so the Lord had to send Isaiah to remind him of His presence. 

*3 Then the Lord said to Isaiah, “Go out, you and your son Shear-Jashub, to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field. 4 Say to him, ‘Be careful, keep calm and don’t be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood—because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah. 5 Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah’s son have plotted your ruin, saying, 6 “Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves, and make the son of Tabeel king over it.” 7 Yet this is what the Sovereign Lord says:*
*“‘It will not take place,*
*it will not happen,*
*8 for the head of Aram is Damascus,*
*and the head of Damascus is only Rezin.*
*Within sixty-five years*
*Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.*
*9 The head of Ephraim is Samaria,*
*and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah’s son.*
*If you do not stand firm in your faith,*
*you will not stand at all.’”*

God clearly lets Ahaz know that the strength of the kingdoms of Aram and Ephraim, which is Northern Israel, lies in people. It is not an establishment like the Roman empire. Yes, Israel does have kings succeeding each other, but [it is not as fixed or stable as the Roman empire, with a Senate and stuff.]
After this person has died, coincidentally this will happen after sixty-five years, the age of pension in the Netherlands, the kingdom will lose its strength. Yes, Ahaz might be dead then as well, but that is not for Ahaz to worry about. As a king he should care about his people, not about himself. 
Unfortunately Ahaz was not a king like David, who trusted in God all the time. 

*10 Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz, 11 “Ask the Lord your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights. ”*
*12 But Ahaz said, “I will not ask; I will not put the Lord to the test. ”*
*13 Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of humans? Will you try the patience of my God also? 14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel. 15 He will be eating curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, 16 for before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste. 17 The Lord will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah—he will bring the king of Assyria. ”*

Now the Lord really gets angry. In verse 1 we had already concluded that Ahaz should not have been afraid based on rational and spiritual trust in God. In verse 3 he gets a reminder anyway, from the prophet Isaiah nonetheless, and if because he still did not have enough faith, God even agreed with that and was willing to give him a sign, but Ahaz rejected, not out of [fake] humility, but because he did not trust God. He did not honestly say that, but he feinted humility. He presented his weak point as if it was something honorable, which is detestable. 
Coming to mind is *the Big Lie*, the book claiming that the Democrats are the actual fascists and turn the truth around by claiming that the Republicans are the fascists. What also comes to mind are Democratic defenders of Planned Parenthood who hear about abortion clinics in minority neighborhoods and performing abortions only, contrary to their *claim* of performing other forms of education and health care. Even though their claim is false, one person defended it by saying about the latter argument: "Well, that only shows that they are focused on what they do." About the former argument she defends it by saying that it is these neighborhoods that need the most help, because they still need to climb the ladder. 

**Assyria, the Lord’s Instrument**
*18 In that day the Lord will whistle for flies from the Nile delta in Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria. 19 They will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks, on all the thornbushes and at all the water holes.*

In the current age we have many examples of invasive species. Fish in Africa, introduced by Europeans probably, lion fish in the Atlantic, most probably thrown in the ocean by pet keepers, and bunnies and foxes In Australia to name but a few. 
Israel had these kind of species as well. I am not sure if these bees and flies were species. Neither am I sure whether they were introduced in Israel or whether they came by accident, traveling along with goods from a caravan from Egypt and Assyria, although I doubt why anyone would introduce flies. 
Yet if they are in waterholes it would seem to me that they are plagues.
Aside from the literal interpretation the flies and bees could also refer to the multitudes of people emigrating from Assyria and Egypt. Assyria was the country attacking Israel, but what did Egypt have to do with it? Were they allies with the Assyrians? 
In a sense, however, they could be seen as plagues as well. They were everywhere and unstoppable. They married the Israelites who were left behind, the ones without education and thorough understanding of God's Law.

*20 In that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates River —the king of Assyria —to shave your head and private parts, and to cut off your beard also. 21 In that day, a person will keep alive a young cow and two goats. 22 And because of the abundance of the milk they give, there will be curds to eat. All who remain in the land will eat curds and honey.*

Taken as prisoners the Israelites were shaved.  Perhaps this was done to the women and children as well. I can only imagine how bad these people were treated. The strong were used as labor slaves, the women as slaves and prostitutes. 
Verse 21 probably indicates that there were still people present in the land, being kept alive with only a young cow and two goats, with enough milk to survive by but no meat or vegetables, at least not enough to be mentioned here. 
There will be so much milk that it will ferment into curds, so that will be what the people will eat. 

 *23 In that day, in every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels, there will be only briers and thorns. 24 Hunters will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns. 25 As for all the hills once cultivated by the hoe, you will no longer go there for fear of the briers and thorns; they will become places where cattle are turned loose and where sheep run.*

There will not be enough people to take care of the land and tend the cattle and flocks of sheep. The only animals that can be eaten are wild ones.
