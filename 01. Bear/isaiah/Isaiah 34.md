# Isaiah 34
**Judgment Against the Nations**
*1 Come near, you nations, and listen;*
*pay attention, you peoples!*
*Let the earth hear, and all that is in it,*
*the world, and all that comes out of it!*
*2 The Lord is angry with all nations;*
*his wrath is on all their armies.*
*He will totally destroy them,*
*he will give them over to slaughter.*

The earth must hear what God is going to say. It will not be a message of hope, but one of devastation, it will being forth despair and distrust [wantrouwen #todo/opzoeken ] in people. 
God's wrath is on the armies of the nations for they have done the things that God detests. The United States are no exception to this, they too have slaughtered many innocent people for the wrong causes and carried out operations for wrong purposes. The current situations of Iran, Iraq and Syria are because that and part of the hatred towards Israel and America is because of that. 
For this reason God will slaughter the armies—when they resist God's will, I want to add, but it is certain that they will. 

*3 Their slain will be thrown out,*
*their dead bodies will stink;*
*the mountains will be soaked with their blood.*

In what way these armies will be slaughtered I do not know, but it will be more devastating than the First World War, where camps were full of dead or sick and injured bodies, with more chance of living outside of the camps than inside due to the enormously unhygienic circumstances. 
This time there will be so many dead bodies that they will not even [de moeite doen] #todo/opzoeken  to preserve the bodies to bury or cremate them later on. A grave will be a luxury which none can afford in these days, for the bodies will be thrown out or left where they were slain and the ground—just like in the north of France where the movie with Tom Hanks and Matt Damon was about #todo/opzoeken —will be soaked with blood.

*4 All the stars in the sky will be dissolved*
*and the heavens rolled up like a scroll;*
*all the starry host will fall*
*like withered leaves from the vine,*
*like shriveled figs from the fig tree.*

No, it will be even worse than that. Even the sky will feel God's punishment and the stars will disappear. Whether they will only be covered by a "roll" of clouds or actually explode and be no more, I do not know, but for sure the sky will be dark first for there will be no more lights, and then it will bright up due to the clouds that reflect the lights of the earth.
Eventually though the starry host will fall, so then it will not merely be a covering of the stars and moon—I am not sure if the sun is included in this. That might be a different time. 
Isaiah might be speaking of two times here, the first one referring to the fall of Assyria and the second to the second coming of Christ.

*5 My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens;*
*see, it descends in judgment on Edom,*
*the people I have totally destroyed.*

This picture described here seems like God has used His sword to cut through the heavens and the stars that are cut off fall down in Edom. What is strange peculiar of this description here is that this verse says the judgement will be on the people God has *already* destroyed. However, one would think the people would be destroyed by these falling stars or meteorites. No, God either already had in His mind that this people would be destroyed, and if God has this in his mind, it is as good a fact that it has already happened, like Isaiah has already mention in chapter 14
> As I have planned, so it will be, and as I have purposed, so it will stand.  

*6 The sword of the Lord is bathed in blood,*
*it is covered with fat—*
*the blood of lambs and goats,*
*fat from the kidneys of rams.*
*For the Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah*
*and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.*



*7 And the wild oxen will fall with them,*
*the bull calves and the great bulls.*
*Their land will be drenched with blood,*
*and the dust will be soaked with fat.*
*8 For the Lord has a day of vengeance,*
*a year of retribution, to uphold Zion’s cause.*

This part sounds like the year of Jubilee, but instead of a celebration and the giving of life, in the form of erasing another's debts, #todo/opzoeken  wat gebeurde er ook alweer in het 50ste jaar. In het 49ste jaar het land terug en de slaven vrij.
God is taking, not a year, but merely a day of vengeance. For the Lord is righteous, but He is merciful as well and does not punish more than needed, but at many times He relents out of love for us. 
On this day, however, He will not relent and He will retribute for the sake of Israel.

*9 Edom’s streams will be turned into pitch,*
*her dust into burning sulfur;*
*her land will become blazing pitch!*
*10 It will not be quenched night or day;*
*its smoke will rise forever.*
*From generation to generation it will lie desolate;*
*no one will ever pass through it again.*

The greatest enemy of Israel will be attacked, which is in a sense, Edom, for they were ever present in the attacks against Israel, their own cousins. 
It has taken generations indeed before anyone ever passed the land and desert of Jordan. Now still, only tourists come to see the carved temples in Petra.

*11 The desert owl and screech owl will possess it;*
*the great owl and the raven will nest there.*
*God will stretch out over Edom*
*the measuring line of chaos*
*and the ::plumb line:: of desolation.*
*12 Her nobles will have nothing there to be called a kingdom,*
*all her princes will vanish away.*

The kingdom of Edom will look nothing like a kingdom. It will consist only of deserts. There will not even be stones to build temples, which is why the people living there, after the Edomites had left or died, carved their temples in the rocks. 

*13 Thorns will overrun her citadels,*
*::nettles and brambles:: her strongholds.*
*She will become a haunt for jackals,*
*a home for owls.*

The land is best described by a deserted place where now only the toughest survivors and predators go to. No one can access it  because of the strong defense, consisting of nettles and brambles. But usually, there is not much valuable to protect. Roses have thorns and blackberry bushes have nettles, but they are not the most beautiful flowers or most delightful fruit. Furthermore, both jackals and owls are not famed for their beauty, rather yet jackals are known for their dishonesty and unfair play by attacking a single prey with a group—although lionesses do the same. 

*14 Desert creatures will meet with hyenas,*
*and wild goats will bleat to each other;*
*there the night creatures will also lie down*
*and find for themselves places of rest.*
*15 The owl will nest there and lay eggs,*
*she will hatch them, and care for her young*
*under the shadow of her wings;*
*there also the falcons will gather,*
*each with its mate.*

But even the worst of the worst will find their mates. Crooks find other crooks to partner with and become friends with, in as far as the term *friends* applies to them. God could have let them die, but for some reason He allows them not to die of lonesomeness, even though He knows that bands of crooks will usually make new plans again to start on the criminal path. 

*16 Look in the scroll of the Lord and read:*
*None of these will be missing,*
*not one will lack her mate.*
*For it is his mouth that has given the order,*
*and his Spirit will gather them together.*
*17 He allots their portions;*
*his hand distributes them by measure.*
*They will possess it forever*
*and dwell there from generation to generation.*

God is righteous in that He knows what even crooks have done well. Even if it is a little, He distributes them by measure. What they deserve, they will get. At least that much they will possess *forever*. I do not understand why this is forever, for even David's offspring would come to lose the kingdom. #todo/opzoeken
