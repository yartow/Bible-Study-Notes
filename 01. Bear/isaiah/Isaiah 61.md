***The Year of the Lord's Favor***
*1 The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me,*
*because the Lord has anointed me*
*to bring good news to the poor;*
*he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,*
*to proclaim liberty to the captives,*
*and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;*

God anointed Jesus for several tasks, but which one of these is the greatest? 	
To bring good news, to proclaim liberty, the year of the Lord's favor, to comfort or to grant things? 
Maybe one or more of these could be less important, be it ever so lightly, but I would not know the answer. But even more important is that they are complimentary. 
The good news is brought to the poor for example, but when those who mourn are comforted and are given beautiful headdresses, that my not help much if the person does not hear the good news; or if mourning captives stay captive, they will wear garments, but in prison. 
So they all need to be done. Even more so, all of us were captives in the jail of sin. All of us were poor in God's eyes, spiritually poor, but in a negative way, not as in the Sermon the Mount in Matthew 5.

*2 to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor,*
*and the day of vengeance of our God;*
*to comfort all who mourn;*

The part I like most is verse 2, where the Lord's favor is proclaimed. Not only that, it i the *year* of the Lord's favor. Can you imagine, a whole year where God is favorable to everyone—perhaps only to those who accept Him, but still, would you not accept a God as good as He is?—and where He *avenges* you? 
That alone is a magnificent statement. It means that the Lord cares so much for us that He is willing to come to Earth for us to take revenge for us for what others have done to us. But He is taking revenge, not only on the Satan, but also on the people whom He created and loves very much. He is like a Father Who has to kill many of His sons and daughters, because many of his other, more—though not completely—innocent children are hurt by the bad ones.

*3 to grant to those who mourn in Zion—*
*to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes,*
*the oil of gladness instead of mourning,*

What is written here is beautiful, in a different sense than physical or outer beauty. What is the feeling you get when you see a poor child receiving a gift, such as a toy or food? You get all warm inside, you feel happy, but it is a different kind of happiness one feels when he receives a gift himself.
The sight of this is what I call beauty. Now, not only for the poor, for that is but one category, although it is a large one, but poverty is also only one aspect of most people's broken lives, but those who are mourning and those who have a faint spirit, they are many. 
How many people are there who are mourning this very day? A period of mourning could be defined, but for some, even after many years, mourning due to the loss of a beloved one is still present. For others, this mourning returns every year, on the day their beloved died or whenever they see an object reminding them of this person. 
Real freedom is only in realizing this person is in a better place or knowing that God's plan is being fulfilled and finding God's plan infinitely more valuable than our own plan. 
If we have to give up one out of two things, we can reluctantly give up that which is of a little less value to us. Just like Meryl Streep had to choose between giving up her son or daughter in the Second World War #tags/historic events/wwii# movie #tags/movies *Sophie's choice* was not content with either choice and still had regrets of this choice in her later years. 
However, it should not be that way with God's plan and ours. We should recognize the value of God's plan which is far higher than ours. Even in later years, if—or when—we reconsider our choices of the past, we should never regret it if we have chosen for God's ways. If we do, it means that we did not value His plans correctly. 
If we did value His plans correctly—which does not happen often and not to every Christian either—there would be no mourning, for even when someone dies and it is certain that this person does not end up in heaven, we may know that God's plan is the best and that it happened in the way He wanted which is always better than what we want. 

*the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit;*
*that they may be called oaks of righteousness,*
*the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified.*

Now as for the faint spirit, that too is a phenomenon that is recognized by too many of us. Many in church—in my (former) church at least—are dealing with this kind of spirit. Their spirit is not replaced by materialism or idolatry, but it has become faint. The power, the fire, the passion has been extinguished. I know people who read the Bible (daily) and still this happened to them. It is my humble guess that this happened because they were not interacting with the Body of Christ. They did not ask and receive the power of prayer, the physical and emotional interaction with the rest of the body through visits, talks and sharing. They kept their emotions and explanation of everything that was wrong to themselves, which is not a good thing when everything in themselves is not healthy. Unhealthy things should be let out, healthy things should be kept. 
But it is good to know that God will replace those faint spirits with garments of praise. It is true that the first symptom by which one can recognize these faint spirits is the lack of praise they have for God. Even Job, who had suffered more than anyone in this world, still praised God for everything he had, even if it was something that could barely be called living. Towards the end, it seemed like his spirit fainted as well, but in due time this will happen to everyone. Usually though, God intervenes, and sometimes friends only make things worse, as in the case of Job. But that does not mean that one should stop trying to talk to friends. In those case it simply requires other friends, friends with more wisdom that is. 

*4 They shall build up the ancient ruins;*
*they shall raise up the former devastations;*
*they shall repair the ruined cities,*
*the devastations of many generations.*

I have been to Athens, Greece, this week and got to watch two hundred years' worth of restoring the Parthenon on the Acropolis, i.e. the temple of Pallas Athena and it was anything from finished. The money it costs for labor, materials but ultimately the gathering of lost pieces takes an immense amount of time and is all but definitive to ever be accomplished, given political issues where Great-Britain for example has many parts of this temple and many other things.
But in the future that Isaiah predicts for the Jews, the ruins of the Wailing Walls will be restored into walls like those of Nehemiah and the temple, of which nothing is life but a pile of stones, will be restored to one more magnificent that Solomon's or Herod's. I would even say it will be completely different for this time it will be accessible for everyone, men, women, children, and perhaps even foreigners. #todo/opzoeken  why were women and children not allowed in the inner court? #biblestudy/questions
The memories of devastation by many generations, these too will be restored. As I have mentioned above there will be no more mourning in heaven or on the New Earth. Assuming that all of this is part of the New Earth it goes without saying that the memory and hurts of past devastations by Israel's enemies will be gone as well. 
But I think it is more than that. If heaven or the New Earth consists of people with wiped out memories, except of language and skills, would that not be missing some part of the extensive variety that God has created in our personality, character and culture, which are all part of our *experiences*? Wiping out memories will remove those experiences as well. Also, it is not possible to wipe out only negative memories.
But what would it look like then? It would probably look like a memory and experience one has, where someone got hurt, but has completely forgiven the other and though on our Earthly life there was still a fragment of this hurt in our memories, God has taken all of the hurt away, but kept the memory.

*5 Strangers shall stand and tend your flocks;*
*foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers;*

Would you allow strangers to tend your flock? If it were only sheep, then maybe yes, but not if you are a good shepherd. But if this is about your church, about people, then I would never let a stranger tend my flock. I would not even let my own family, friends, Christian or not, tend my flock if I do not know their heart and capability. But one day this trust will be so perfect, that strangers and foreigners, who speak a different language than we do, who do things differently than we do, will be made responsible to take care of the things so valuable to us, our flocks, the land and our fruit. 

*6 but you shall be called the priests of the Lord;*
*they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God;*
*you shall eat the wealth of the nations,*
*and in their glory you shall boast.*

I return to the point of when I asked my question about when all these things written in this chapter and the previous will happen. It has not happened before and so it will happen in the future. Will it happen then on Earth, in heaven of on the new Earth? Most likely things will only get worse on Earth as we near the end of the End Times and Revelations does not say anything (as far as I know about these things concerning the Israelites). The leaves heaven and the new Earth. 
My question concerns the existence of nations in heaven or on the new Earth. The third line in verse 6 sounds a bit harsh when it says that the Israelites will *eat* the wealth of the nations. This sounds like enjoying the spills of a nation after having conquered it. 
Of course one could also interpret it in this way. Nations still exist, but more as cultural boundaries—not to keep people away, but to welcome them and immerse them in a new culture to teach them how their culture is doing. 
This would be more in line with the last line, which says that the Israelites "shall boast in their glory." This makes sense when we realize that (or maybe almost) every culture glorifies God in a certain way. The Chinese do it through respect, the Japanese with order and discipline, the Middle-Eastern cultures with hospitality, the Dutch through structure and rules and the Americans #todo/opzoeken through?? 
Israelites (among other people) on the new Earth (or perhaps in heaven) will learn about and adapt themselves to every culture so that they will glorify God even more. 
In a sense that is eating of the wealth of a nation, because the culture of a nation could be seen as its wealth. Money would not be particularly seen as *its* wealth. The gold might not have been dug there, and its all materialistic. But ask an Italian for example what their wealth is, and they will tell you that it is their food, their agricultural products, the art by Renaissance artists such as Michelangelo, Rafael, Leonardo DaVinci and Donatello and the paintings, sculptures and others works they created. These not being part of their social culture perse, but definitely a part of their culture altogether. These things as well will be part of the Israelites will enjoy on the new Earth. 
As a matter of fact *eating* does not only mean devouring, it could also mean tasting. Here on Earth there are too may factors blocking us from visiting every culture and tasting every part of it, but on the new Earth we have all the time, love and patience to learn new cultures, i.e. their food, art, language and behavioral aspects of it.
The Israelites will boast in this glory, even though the roots of these wonderful things lie in other cultures. This could slightly be compared with Japan boasting of sushi, although it is invented somewhere in the south of China or even outside of China. However, I think it will not exactly be like this. On the New Earth all cultures will be friendly towards each other and be influenced by each other's culture. Boasting will then not be an arrogant attitude of what they have and what others do not have, but rather the feeling of being proud of having accomplished making something of someone else's culture your own. 
Israel has in part succeeded in this due to its immigration of Israelites from all ends of the world to Israel. Israel itself does not have a "Jewish" culture perse, which by the way is unknown and has most likely changed over time as well, but it has a mixed culture consisting of people who migrated to Israel after World War II. #tags/historic events/wwii#

*7 Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion;*
*instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot;*
*therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion;*
*they shall have everlasting joy.*

This sounds like a reward that God is giving the Israelites for having gone through hard times outside of their country. Ever since the first diaspora (the first? #todo/opzoeken ) by the Assyrians Israelites have lived outside of Israel, often times in dire circumstances. Now Jews are known for their money and their position in the financial world, but Jewish neighborhoods like the Bronx #todo/opzoeken which ones
are ghettos and slums and definitely not know for their wealth. So the majority of Jewish people in these neighborhoods, though above average intelligent or otherwise talented, are still not liked, mistreated, and not living comfortably. Shame and dishonor are but euphemisms for what they truly feel #todo/opzoeken poverty among Jews in the United States.
But back in Israel, when that day comes, they shall possess a double portion, because they are God's firstborn.

*8 For I the Lord love justice;*
*I hate robbery and wrong;*
*I will faithfully give them their recompense,*
*and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.*

The Lord loves justice. He *is* righteous and therefore He must be just, that is why He needs to take *action*. Some people are very righteous, but when it comes to it they do not *do* much, other want to but are not able to for we are mere men and what can we do about the justice of a nation? 
The Lord not only *does* these things, He takes action, He punishes and rewards people, but He also *loves* to *do* these things. Looking the great amount of blessings and the minute details, even the number of verses spent on it in Isaiah and in other books, it becomes clear that God loves blessing us. Whether He loves punishing people I do not dare say—as a father I would think not. 

About faithfulness, God had already faithful. He would be their God as long as the Israelites would be faithful to Him. There were not and He has the right to lift His hands from them. Did God promise to return every time whenever they regretted their actions? 
#todo/opzoeken maybe it is in the everlasting part. Or is that only valid when they haven't broken the covenant? God has already been released from this covenant. 

::*9 Their offspring shall be known among the nations,*::
::*and their descendants in the midst of the peoples;*::
::*all who see them shall acknowledge them,*::
::*that they are an offspring the Lord has blessed.*::

It is a pity that *MacSBNnkjv* has nothing to say about this, because I think it was from Josh McDowell's book *Answers and Reasons* that I read the for the very first time that Jews were a chosen people, a people of God, recognizable by their amazing features. I have never read this in any other book while there is so much to say about this, and while this—to me at least—amazing proof of the fact the fact the Jews are a chosen people. #todo/opzoeken other books with information about the uniqueness of Jews. 

*10 I will greatly rejoice in the Lord;*
*my soul shall exult in my God,*
*for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation;*
*he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,*

The question in this verse is why the writer, i.e. not Isaiah but everyone who is rejoiced, is so exulted. The answer is written in the third and fourth lines: he is saved and he has been restored in his righteousness. 

~About salvation #todo nog af te maken~

Now about righteousness. How can one be covered with a robe of righteousness? I know it is merely a figure of speech, like a symbolism, and I could understand a robe of wealth for example. Wealth is different in that it is an amount of money. God could give one an amount of money so large that it would make him and his family wealthy for the rest of his life. But how could God give someone an amount of righteousness so large that he would profit from it and enjoy it the rest of his life? For no matter how much righteousness has been done to you after someone has inflicted you, it only takes one act of unrighteousness to be in an unrighteousness state. In other words, the righteousness done to you in a previous matter does not solve any other matters of righteousness. 
However, if we look at it in another way. Suppose that the robe of wealth means that wealth would always be bestowed on him for as long as he would wear that robe. Then the robe of righteousness means that as long as this person wears that robe of righteousness, then righteousness would be bestowed on him. That means that the robe, though not a physical object, is something that will cause people to be righteous to him. It is like a ring from the king, or an edict, which causes everyone to obey a person. 
When the day comes that everyone, including all Christians—because currently not every Christian is in favor of Jews—realize that the Israelites, i.e. the Jews, are truly God's people, they will receive the respect that is due them. #todo/opzoeken/engels due them or due to them? 

*as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress,*
*and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.*

These things that God gives, salvation and righteousness, are both beautiful, noticeable and precious. People who see it can immediately distinguish from a crowd that this person is different, he has been saved, and he is righteous. This does not mean of course that others will be righteous towards him. That is not a part of human nature, unfortunately. The observance is there, but the reaction is not always present. In other words, if you are friendly to others, it does not always mean that other will be friendly to you as well. 
But these things are so valuable. They are worth whatever they cost. Fortunately, we did not have to pay for salvation or for righteousness. Jesus has paid for salvation by taking upon himself the negative implications of the righteousness that were due us. 
Not only the value of what had to paid for it, also the practical value is so high. "Using" these clothes and robe of salvation and righteousness, means that we can walk in certain in life and know we are saved, confident that no force from hell can ever take us away from God's hand. 
We know that as our life is part of God's plan we have confidence He will give us strength for every situation. 

*11 For as the earth brings forth its sprouts,*
*and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up,*
*so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise*
*to sprout up before all the nations.*

Earth, I am talking about the dirt and the ground, not the planet, is a strange thing. If you were to analyze it, it would be merely very fine pieces of sand, which is nothing more than finely crushed rock, which is transparant, like glass, and some "stuff" on it, minerals, organic waste and something else, which makes it dark. But things sprout from it. Even if you think there's nothing in it, no seed or whatsoever, something always comes out of it. 
The thing is, there *is* something in it. There are perhaps numerous seeds being blown, some so small they can barely be seen, and they end up everywhere. 
As long as nothing hinders them from growing and there is the right amount of moist, warmth and later on sunlight, the seeds and plants will grow—often times more than we want to. We need to cut grass, and especially weeds, almost every week, because these grow like crazy. And they're all growing from this little bit of black stuff on the pieces of sand. 
This Earth—now I *am* speaking of the planet—does not seem to have a lot to offer. It is mostly not organic material, sand so to speak, with a little bit of dead organic material on it, in this case mostly spiritually dead material. Yet God can grow righteousness and peace from it. Not only growing, but sprouting from it, like freshly growing grass that needs to be cut every week. The speed with which it is growing and the total volume of it is huge. 
This means, of course, that God has sown this and it also means that this righteousness can grow from the unrighteousness done to those in the past, that is to those living and not living. For as seeds grow from organic material, dead leaves and other things that have once lived, so righteousness grows from out of a need for righteousness because it was not granted to those before.
