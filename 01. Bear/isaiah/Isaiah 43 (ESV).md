# Isaiah 43 (ESV)
**Israel’s Only Savior**

*1 But now thus says the Lord,*
*he who created you, O Jacob,*
*he who formed you, O Israel:*
*“Fear not, for I have redeemed you;*
*I have called you by name, you are mine.*

It is remarkable that God calls us by name. He knows the star by number, but us by name. That is personal, to begin with. I have heard someone say that all other gods have designations, no personal names. Our God is the only one Who has—His name is YHWH, *I am Who I am*. I am still not sure about this argument though, because that too sounds like a designation—even though He designated this name to Himself—and some gods like Buddha and Shiva are names as well, right? #todo/opzoeken  
But in our case, that we have names, unlike animals, and that God call us by our name (see Revelations)—that is the name He has given us, not the name our parents have given us—that is *special*! It is special for a god, because in any other religion there is not this close bond between gods and humans. Gods reign over human, they do no father them. 
It is not specifically mentioned here, but our names given by God, our *God-given names*, are not indicative of how our parents see us or hope for us to be, but they are indicative of how God sees us, of *who* we are. 	

*2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;*
*and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you;*
*when you walk through fire you shall not be burned,*
*and the flame shall not consume you.*

In a time when the rivers did not have bridges or because people did not often cross rivers, because they were borders to other countries, it was dangerous to cross a river. One wrong step and the water could overwhelm you and let you drift away. 
There were several ways of overcoming this, aside from building a bridge. The first way was to walk to the point where the river was smaller and milder. This could take days though. Another way—within the first way—was to wait until the season was right. Most likely in winter and fall there rivers were wild, but in spring and summer the rivers were more still due to the drought.
Both cases require a lot of patience and effort (when walking) and are not efficient, because in the time that one cannot cross the river, nothing is achieved. Also, it is not very effective because one still has not reached his goal as long as he has not crossed the river. 
The second way is form a line where everyone is held together by a safety rope and people start entering the water. Now it is likely that one person falls, but as long as the other people stay strong, the chance becomes small for all of them to fall—and as long as the majority is still standing, the fallen ones can be picked up. 
The worldwide Church is this group of people held together by one safety rope, the Holy Spirit, where some are strong in the Spirit and hence strong enough to hold up the others. 
Note that it is not one person who can be strong, but it is multiple people who have to have enough surplus strength to pull the weight of one fallen person. Also, they need to work together. 
Also note that there is a difference between this analogy and the truth. The strength that people have is from the Holy Spirit, not from the people themselves or their combined effort. As a matter of fact, people would not even be working together for a positive goal if it were not for the Holy Spirit's presence. (Contrast that with the Tower of Babel. There people did work together but for a negative goal.)
Second, a rope made from the Holy Spirit will never break. People are bound by it when they choose to. Unknowingly they will help others, even if they do not actively pull. 
Can they break the rope? No. Can they get loose from it? No, otherwise others would fall. 
Let us suppose that people do have the choice of getting loose from this rope. Then if everyone does this, the ones still standing would easily flush away and no Christians would be left standing. This would mean, in other words, that we people, are not able to let other Christians fall (because even if one or two Christians remain, the rope is still their strength), but when all "Christians" choose to forfeit their belief in God, God's plan is finished. So in other words, humans have the power to influence God's plan. That of course is not true. 
In a sense it is *slightly* true but only to the amount of choosing whether to follow God or not. Each person—when chosen by God—may choose whether to follow God. But when one has chosen he has no choice anymore but to follow Christ. He has give his heart and life to Christ. 
The same goes for the devil. When one has rejected Christ and chosen to follow the devil, no matter how hard he tries to get back to God, he cannot follow Christ anymore. 
#todo/opzoeken  Perhaps there are some holes in my theory. 

*3 For I am the Lord your God,*
*the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.*
*I give Egypt as your ransom,*
*Cush and Seba in exchange for you.*
::*4 Because you are precious in my eyes,*::
::*and honored, and I love you,*::
::*I give men in return for you,*::
::*peoples in exchange for your life.*::

The Lord is *our* God, unlike other "gods" which belong to other peoples. If God sacrifices Egypt as our ransom, Ethiopia and its surrounding countries, it is because they have not worshipped God like Israel has. Yes, God loves them too, but they cannot return His love. 
Now this verse is not saying that God is actually sacrificing these people, because no one can ask God for a ransom; no one can snatch anything away from God. But God is saying here that He loves us so much, He would be willing to give up some of His creation, the peoples who do not worship Him as their Savior, so that we may be free. 

*5 Fear not, for I am with you;*
*I will bring your offspring from the east,*
*and from the west I will gather you.*
*6 I will say to the north, Give up,*
*and to the south, Do not withhold;*
*bring my sons from afar*
*and my daughters from the end of the earth,*
*7 everyone who is called by my name,*
*whom I created for my glory,*
*whom I formed and made.”*

This seems very much like the Zionistic movement after the Second World War. From at least two #todo/opzoeken  windstreken Jews have returned: Europe in the north and the United States in the west. Perhaps Russia is the east referred to here and the south Africa, although I am not sure if there were any Jews at all at that time and whether they returned to Israel after WWII. But perhaps that is the reason why it says "do not withhold" instead of "give up". This is because Europe in the north had to give up the war and the Jewish hostages. The south did not have any Jewish hostages, but perhaps there have been Jewish traders in Africa or Asia. 

*8 Bring out the people who are blind, yet have eyes,*
*who are deaf, yet have ears!*
*9 All the nations gather together,*
*and the peoples assemble.*
*Who among them can declare this,*
*and show us the former things?*
*Let them bring their witnesses to prove them right,*
*and let them hear and say, It is true.*

If people still do not believe that our God is the One and only God, they should come together, like in the days of Elijah when God stood up against 400 prophets of Baal. God will prove that He is real and more powerful. 
None of the other gods can show even the past and know what happened and how things came to be, let alone predict the future. Even if they can predict the future, they can only tell what is going to happen, they can not decide it, like God can. 
Let there be witnesses to say that God is King over the universe, over space and time and more.
There have been many witnesses, many heathens and pagans even. Take Nebuchadnezzar for example, or his "predecessor" Sennacherib who both saw God's power—one in seeing his sanity slipping away, the other in losing his kingdom. 

*10 “You are my witnesses,” declares the Lord,*
*“and my servant whom I have chosen,*
*that you may know and believe me*
*and understand that I am he.*
*Before me no god was formed,*
*nor shall there be any after me.*

As followers of Christ, Christians, and other followers of God, Jews, we are witnesses of the greatness of God. I do not know how to witness to others that no god was formed before Him or will be after Him. Even if we can prove that God is real and that all miracles are real, how can we prove there has never been a god before Him? 
I think the answer is in the first part. If we can prove that God is real, then His words and promises are real as well. God has said in His Word that He and He alone, that is the Trinity consisting of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, were (present) in the beginning and no one or nothing else. 
If God is real then He speaks the truth, otherwise He would not be real. In the case of a lying god, this god would not be the God of the Bible, because God does not lie. But if we can prove that the "current" god of this world does not lie and has fulfilled His promises, and that this god is God Himself, then His truth about the past and future must be true as well. 
We can be witnesses when we know and believe God and understand that this god we believe in is God Himself. One way or another this will lead to other people believing in God as well. 

So we are His *witnesses* (plural), but what does it mean that *we* are His *servant* (singular) as well? Is each of us to witness individually, but to serve corporally? #biblestudy/questions

*11 I, I am the Lord,*
*and besides me there is no savior.*
*12 I declared and saved and proclaimed,*
*when there was no strange god among you;*
*and you are my witnesses,” declares the Lord, “and I am God.*

The Lord is the only One Who can save us, no matter in what time we are living. But in those time that we did not have our technology to "fix" everything in our lives, we could see more of God saving us. It seems like the more technology we have, the more our attention goes to those kind of things. 
Take for example the vacuum cleaner, when people started having these they suddenly had a lot more time to do they things they wanted. Unfortunately, the things they wanted were not good things. And as soon as they got this idea that more time equals more fun a whole trend started of becoming more time efficient. A car could bring people faster to work, people would even start using planes on a daily basis. People started to work more hours, now that they spend less time in traffic. With the Internet work is even done in traffic or at home, without any traveling time at all. 
The peace they felt when they had more time in the beginning of the 30s perhaps, when the (electric) vacuum cleaner was invented #todo/opzoeken when? 
and the declining feeling thereof is not part of a decreasing slope #todo/opzoeken  Nederlands en Engels woord hiervoor? 
It is because of the reason people want rest, which is work—between which needs to be a right balance. We cannot work for 10 days and then take four days off, this does not have the same effect as a weekly weekend. 
Also, they are basing this feeling of peace on their activities. They think that the right activity will give them peace of mind. 
Now God *has* given us nature, technology and many other things as a blessing and to help us to "leave" this world of busy-ness at times, but that is merely the physical part of peace—to not get distracted by sounds, effort or other stimulants. But our spirit needs rest as well, which it can only find in God's Word, in the relationship with Him, but putting our trust and faith in His Son Jesus Christ.

*13 Also henceforth I am he;*
*there is none who can deliver from my hand;*
*I work, and who can turn it back?”*

God makes the statement here that not only now, but later on, in the future, He will still be the One Who delivers us and there will never be anyone who can steal us from His hand. There will also never be anyone who can turn back God's hand. God's promises and His works cannot be undone. 
Yes, this world is fading away (cf. Galatians? #todo/opzoeken  ), sin is destroying this world and the people—the beautiful creation of the Lord. But His work, which is the salvation of this world and the people, will not be undone. No one can stop all Christians from evangelizing. The devil will incite many people to fight against Christians: Muslim, Buddhist, Hindus, atheists and among the latter the LGBT community, feminists (version 2.0 and higher), in short everyone on the Left—but he has never succeeded. Rather yet, Christianity has always been growing. Even with shockingly diminishing numbers in the West—and the same rates apply for orthodox Jews as well by the way—the growth of Christians in Africa and Asia is enough to compensate for that. It is everything except the West, i.e. Western Europa and North America, where Christianity is growing.

*14 Thus says the Lord,*
*your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:*
~*“For your sake I send to Babylon*~
~*and bring them all down as fugitives,*~  #biblestudy/questions
*even the Chaldeans, in the ships in which they rejoice.*

Does this mean God sends a savior to Babylon or that He sends the Jews to Babylon to become fugitives?
Overall seen, both answers are correct. It is God Who sent the Jews to Babylon. They were not fugitives, but captives, and He did it for the sake of the Jews. Without this event the Jews would never have obeyed God and be loyal to Him like they have been since 400 BC. Ever since that time they have not worshipped idols anymore, even though the countries they were in consisted of heavy idol worshipping, i.e. both Assyria (although the Jews from that era have been dispersed), Babylon and Persia, although during the latter two reigns the Jews could freely exercise their religion and the people were even forbidden to disrespect our God. Perhaps that was something the Jews could hold on to and have afterwards always remembered, which kept them from turning to idols. 
When the Jews returned they were not fugitives either, so I am wondering what the meaning is of that #biblestudy/questions .
The previous line was written on 20180728, now one day later, the very next morning God has given me the answer. "Them" is referring to the Babylonians. It is for the Jews' sake that God brings down the Babylonians to the extent of being fugitives from their "own" country. It was not their "own" to begin with, of course, because they too inhabited after invading it first. 
No matter what man may think of God and how they attribute the cruel things of the world to God—instead of blaming the people who do that, they blame God Who could prevent that—God, first of all, is *not* and *never* the One Who does anything bad. He can never be blamed for what people are doing. Second of all, whatever God does, He always has a plan and He is using man's actions for the good of His plan. 
In this case God *will* use (in the future) Cyrus to let the Babylonians flee and start a new era in which the Jews can steadily return to their own country. 

*15 I am the Lord, your Holy One,*
*the Creator of Israel, your King.”*

The Lord is the *Creator* of Israel, written here with a capital "C", it is His Name, it is Who He is. It is also what He has done, but that is not most important. He is the Creator of His people Who has also provided a land for them, not only for them to live in, but also for them to ~use their skills~ (in farming (engineering), finance and education, as they have become top ranking in the world, this is clearly visible), ~live safely~ within their own religious boundaries (socially and morally, although this is not very clear anymore, the ceremonial lows on the other hand are still visible), ~spread the Word of God~. The latter too has become rather dubious nowadays. To a lot of people the Israelites are evil and supported by America to invade the country of the Palestinians. Both Judaism and Christianity have become less popular (in part) for this reason. 
Actually, it is completely the other way around. The country belongs to the Israelites in the first place, even more than what is considered "Israel" right now. Even the country of Jordan or parts thereof were part of Israel. But Israel has accepted that and has even given areas to the Palestinians. Are these parts actually worse in terms of hygiene, water supply and other things? I am not sure about that. Perhaps the Israelites are thinking that now that an area belongs to the Palestinians, they should take of it themselves. 
Secondly, Israel has the most moral army in the world, warning the enemy and civilians of the enemy *before* they attack them by phone calls and flyers and in this way they *are* showing their moral superiority.

*16 Thus says the Lord,*
*who makes a way in the sea,*
*a path in the mighty waters,*
*17 who brings forth chariot and horse,*
*army and warrior;*
*they lie down, they cannot rise,*
*they are extinguished, quenched like a wick:*

When a war is fought with the Lord on your side, you will always win, because victory always belongs to the Lord. In that sense you can say that if you do not win, God was not on your side and you were in a wrong war. However, in the case of the Vietnam War it was the Democrats who pulled back support and ammunition for the Vietnamese, without it the Americans most definitely would have defeated the Communists. 
We cannot reason like this, because God does not work with hypothetical situations. If He is in a war, He wins it, no matter the conditions. As a matter of fact, He is never *in* a war, He is always above it. He decides who is going to win, so in this case, He has decided that Vietnam would lose to the Communists and be taken over by them. 
Should the Americans never have helped then? My educated guess is that this war caused a lot of Vietnamese and American lives. If the end result is that the Communists win, then indeed, there would have been no need to the Americans to intervene. A lot of money and lives would have been spared then, perhaps even everything, i.e. all of the lives and money. 
The end result is clear, now, in hindsight, but to God this has always been clear. It would not have changed, because no one can change God's plans. Of course, if the Democrats had not done what they did, the Vietnam War would have resulted differently, but God knew they would do that, so the result was set. In that sense, however noble, America should never have set foot on Vietnam soil, but this can only be said in hindsight or through prophecy.  

*18 “Remember not the former things,*
*nor consider the things of old.*
*19 Behold, I am doing a new thing;*
*now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?*
*I will make a way in the wilderness*
*and rivers in the desert.*

For what reason is God telling us here not to think about the past? Is it because it reminds us of sadness or because we should not view the future in the perspective of the past? 
If we keep thinking about the past, or in other words, if the past is holding on to us, then no matter how bright the current situation is or the promise of a bright future, your past will influence your perspective, that is your view of things. 
God is making a way in the desert, He is creating rivers with drinkable water. Deserts have no ways. For the unfamiliar eye there is no difference between east or west and people could walk in circles without knowing it. 
A river in the desert indicates life. There is water to drink, and where there is water, there vegetables and plants can grow. Animals live there which can be eaten. ~Water provides cool, cleanliness and calmness~. It provides hydration, nutrition, transportation, direction (a river always leads to a city or a sea). #church/material [Over deze drie dingen kan iets gezegd worden, in tegenstelling tot de 3 R'en, rust, regelmaat en reinheid, kan de regelmaat vervangen worden door "verfrissing". Verfrissing biedt kalmte. Reinheid biedt verfrissing. In de Bijbel wordt er vaker gesproken over verfrissing en altijd #todo/opzoeken [altijd? of in de meeste gevallen?] in de vorm van koel water.  Koel water is ook een vorm om bacteriën minder snel te laten groeien, stromend water is ook koeler dan stilstaand water #todo/opzoeken  [feit?]. 
Het belang van *cool* wordt onderschat. Niet dat het belangrijker is, maar het is essentieel. Als wij ons denken niet verfrissen (cf. Rom 12:1-2) (bijvoorbeeld door seminars over de juiste manier van opvoeden (geef een paar voorbeelden van die cursus (sen) van Rob Hondsmerk over opvoeden, een rijbewijs om te rijden en een cursus om te trouwen en op te voeden, over het brengen van God in de familie, door o.a. Family Time, maar ook de manier van straffen door bijvoorbeeld een paard en een teugel, aan sommige paarden moet je trekken, andere niet) onze manieren (cf. nieuwe wijn in oude zakken, ons blijven vasthouden aan oude manieren terwijl het publiek heel anders is, in tegenstelling tot de manier zoals we dat doen bij LEEF! en inspiratie blijven zoeken (leiderschapscursussen van Bill Hybels (cd. the 360 degree leader) of John Maxwell bijvoorbeeld, of Compassion Leiderschapsseminars)—het verschil tussen het eerste en de derde is dat bij de eerste kennis die al bekend is nu in een nieuw daglicht wordt gezet, en bij de derde echt nieuwe dingen worden geleerd]
But one who is holding on to the past can see a road or way in the desert and be pessimistic about it. He can have thoughts such as "*Where will this road lead to, will it lead to a dangerous place?*" As for the rivier, he might think "*Is this water safe to drink? And will there not be dangerous animals attracted to these waters?*"
So therefore, do not remember the former things, but behold the new things God has made and is going to make. 

*20 The wild beasts will honor me,*
*the jackals and the ostriches,*
*for I give water in the wilderness,*
*rivers in the desert,*
*to give drink to my chosen people,*
*21 the people whom I formed for myself*
*that they might declare my praise.*

God takes care of the people He created. We are His creations and just like we have an intrinsic need to take care of our children and of our own material creations, be it a book, a piece of software or even a company we built from the ground up, we do not want it to go to waste—*we built it for a purpose*. 
That is the reason God is taking care of His creation. But if part of His creation is going to destroy the better part, it is good to destroy this former part so that not all will be lost. 
He takes care even for the animals and sacrifices the animals in order to feed us. Why is this needed? Could the whole world be vegetarian? #todo/opzoeken  
I do not know the answer to that, but it is—I believe—to make us humans better. Physically we can perform more, we can get stronger, smarter, eat less or spend less time on eating and gathering food. The energy density of animal fats is much bigger than that of plants. The amount of protein taken in by meat is much bigger than by vegetables. Also, it requires a great variety of plants to get all the needed amino acids. 
Lastly, the enjoyment is bigger—for most people—of eating meat. God is willing to sacrifice part (in this case, *some animals* die, though not necessarily *some species*) of His creation so that we might benefit from it. 
Summarizing, God sacrifices His own creation for two reasons: so that one part gets to fulfill its purpose and to let one part gets more benefits from it. In other words, God lets some part of humanity die so that a part can saved for heaven, and some animals die so that humans can benefit for it. 

*22 “Yet you did not call upon me, O Jacob;*
*but you have been weary of me, O Israel!*
*23 You have not brought me your sheep for burnt offerings,*
*or honored me with your sacrifices.*
*I have not burdened you with offerings,*
*or wearied you with frankincense.*
*24 You have not bought me sweet cane with money,*
*or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices.*
*But you have burdened me with your sins;*
*you have wearied me with your iniquities.*

The #todo/opzoeken tegenstellingen are clear here in God's actions and ours. God is doing only good things for us and we repay Him with bad ones. God gives us water to drink from and get strength. Even the animals honor Him for it, though they cannot speak, bow or worship or even know God, but humans, who can do all of that and more, do not even call upon God when they need His help, let alone worship or praise Him. Even worse, they are *weary* of Him! How can anyone be weary of a person who only gives good things and the things we need?
What has God done wrong? He does not ask for animal offerings or frankincense. He has commanded these things in Leviticus, indeed, but He has also said that it is not these things that He actually wants. God wants mercy and knowledge of Him (cf. Hosea 6:6) rather than sacrifice and burnt offerings, and even David said that a broken heart and spirit as a gift to God will not be despised by Him (Psalm 51). 
How have we repaid God? By sinning and by our iniquities, by giving in to our lust, evil desires, immoral sexual behavior and greed (cf. Colossians 3:5). 

*::25 “I, I am he*::
::*who blots out your transgressions for my own sake,*::
::*and I will not remember your sins.*::

God blots out our transgressions for *His* own sake. Yes indeed, and as a matter of fact everything He does is ultimately for His own sake, but this specific deed needs to be addressed, because He does not owe us anything. 
Perhaps God is doing it for His own reputation, like Moses wanted to protect God's reputation to other nations in Exodus. God is also keeping His own promise, namely that He will always be the God of Israel and the Israelites, but only when they cry out and call for Him again. This is not what they are doing at the moment #todo/opzoeken  so it seems, but still God is merciful and blots out their transgressions. 
So indeed, God is not doing this because He has to, i.e. He has to hold his promise, because He does not have to in this case, but because He wants to Himself. 

*26 Put me in remembrance; let us argue together;*
*set forth your case, that you may be proved right.*

God wants us to argue *with Him*. Not that He wants to *argue* with us, it is not about the arguing—of course He rather enjoys a pleasant talk with us than an argument—but it is better to argue with God than with an idol. It is good that we look Him up when we are in problems, that is better than going to any other place to seek for help. 
Why would God say "that you may be proved right"? That would only be in the case when the people are actually right, but they are not. But perhaps God wants the people not to give up. He knows the people (somehow) realize they are wrong. Perhaps they have given up on starting an argument and given up on the hope that God would ever help them or even argue with them. It is of no use, they have no arguments for their committed sins. 
But God still wants to set forth their case, adding to that *as if* they may be proved right, to have the agility and the boldness to ask God to forgive them and even go to trial.

*27 Your first father sinned,*
*and your mediators transgressed against me.*
*28 Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary,*
*and deliver Jacob to utter destruction* 
*and Israel to reviling.*

Our first father, Adam, or the Israelites' first father, Abraham, sinned and all the mediators who came afterwards, the judges and the prophets and the priests as well, as everyone does. But most likely here is meant those who sinned a lot against God, which are most of the kings who came after David. 
Though kings are not necessarily mediators, except for the fact that they should rule over the people on behalf of God and be an example to them, it would explain why God would profane the "princes". However, it says not only "princes" but "princes of the *sanctuary*", which would indicate the priests. I only know of some priests in the reign of David who sinned, such as Abiathar. 
But would the sin of a priest be put on the whole of Jacob's people, that is Israel? In a sense, yes. It is the combined sin of the nation as a whole that has led Israel to be punished as she has been. A bad economy where the poor and needy are not taken care of, is not causes by one person, but by that of every person. Reprimanding does not come from one person only, but from each other (cf. Matthew 18:15 and Luke 17:4), but the priests and prophets have a bigger role and responsibility in that, perhaps even a critical one.
