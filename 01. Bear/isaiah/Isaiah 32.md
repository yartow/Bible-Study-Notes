# Isaiah 32
**The Kingdom of Righteousness**
*1 See, a king will reign in righteousness*
*and rulers will rule with justice.*
*2 Each one will be like a shelter from the wind*
*and a refuge from the storm,*
*like streams of water in the desert*
*and the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land.*

This is the moment I have been waiting for. I am not sure if this ever was a period in history. It could refer to the period of the Persians, when there was peace, and under Cyrus—if that is the king under which Ezra and Nehemiah served—there was fear, perhaps, but respect for God and His people. There might have been righteousness as well, although I have heard of other countries—I remember it was the area of Syria and Babylon—which had been brutally attacked, though that too could have been righteousness.
That peace, how lovely as it may have been, would pale to the ultimate peace God is preparing in the end times. That peace of the Persians was limited in quality and duration. It was not as fulfilling as the peace God can give when He rules on Earth and it came to an end, because the king did not live forever or because he could not contain the people of his empire any longer. 
God did this so that we would not be satisfied with that world as it was. We humans become satisfied too quickly in this sense and then do not long for heaven anymore, for we humans have proven too many times throughout history that we stay where we are. The Israelites wanted to go back to Egypt, most of the Israelite captives by Babylon stayed in Persia and if the Israelite captives by Assyria had a choice, they would probably have chosen to stay there as well. 

*3 Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed,*
*and the ears of those who hear will listen.*
*4 The fearful heart will know and understand,*
*and the stammering tongue will be fluent and clear.*

Isaiah says here that the people who are now seeing—now being back then, but also right now in 2018—are actually seeing with their eyes closed, and we are not actually listening. I understand what he says. I see things in this world, but I do not see them completely, as if I saw a silhouette moving through my eyelids. We often hear about ghosts, but angels as well, but we cannot explain it. How does that fit with science? It is because there is so much we cannot see yet.
How many of us say they do not hear God speaking clearly? Is it just a [vlaag] #todo/opzoeken in our minds? That would be too much of a coincidence, for most of the times it is telling me not to do the wrong things. 
Isaiah is saying all of our hearts are fearful and no one is speaking fluently. Everyone is fearful, whether they admit it or not. They are not, unfortunately, fearful of God, but they have a fear of life, of not achieving things in life, not receiving love from others, not being accepted in a group or fulfilling their mission. Whatever it is, everyone lives in fear and is driven by fear. Even after knowing God we still live, partially, in fear. But this will change. 
Our tongues are stammering when we pray, because we are not sure if we are talking to someone. Some like Moses and Abraham have had the privilege to talk to God with certainty, but we are talking to something invisible, not sure of whether He will hear us, every day again. 
This too will come to an end. We will hear God clearly and speak to Him with certainty, the certainty that He exists and hears us, with faith that He gives us what we need. 

*5 No longer will the fool be called noble*
*nor the scoundrel be highly respected.*

Likewise God is saying that some of those who are called noble right now, are actually fools and some who are highly respected are actually scoundrels. I surely agree with that. 
What can we say of the Prince of Monaco #todo/opzoeken is he king already? 
whose mother was the late Grace Kelly. I do not know about his father, but the fact he sought an actress—whose [op het gebied van relaties en seks, niet moreel, niet zeden, maar ... ? #todo/opzoeken ] reputation was far from flawless—does not prove much of his own moral values. The prince himself has had a multitude of women as well. Noble or not, they are far from God's standard. 
As for highly respected scoundrels, is Saul Alinsky #todo/opzoeken  naam goed gespeld? 
not the best example? He was—besides a university student, not deserving the *title scholar*—nothing more than someone who tries to benefit from loopholes. His values were not that of anti-racism or protection and equal treatment of minority groups. He wanted to make a buck and he did so forcing black labor force upon white companies, without considering education or merit. 
The sad thing about him is that at least three powerful people sprouted from his teachings: two presidents and a secretary of state who was also the runner-up at the presidential elections, Barack Obama and Bill and Hillary Clinton, respectively. #tags/politics This not only shows that many have taken over his criminal style of manipulation and abuse of political power for self-centered causes, but also how the mainstream media bend the truth to show who is on the "good" side, and the people believe that, as is shown by the huge polls Hillary Clinton got and how she almost defeated Trump. 
But this will be history and people will realize that idols they worshipped are nothing more than beautiful facades of very sinful people.

*6 For fools speak folly,*
*their hearts are bent on evil:*
*They practice ungodliness*
*and spread error concerning the Lord;*
*the hungry they leave empty*
*and from the thirsty they withhold water.*

They are fools, but how can we prove that? By seeing what the Bible says about fools. First of all, their hearts are bent on evil, which is characterized by two characteristics: the practice of ungodliness and the spreading of error concerning the Lord. What follows is inevitable, in the last line of verse 6, where the hungry and thirsty are the ones who suffer the most. This is all astonishingly true of the Democrats. 
As for ungodliness, Bill Clinton showed this very clearly. Even before he was in the White House he had many sexual avances outside of his marriage, some that may be qualified as manipulation, while others are straight-out rapes. Hillary Clinton shows this by the corruptness she shamelessly invokes by helping others for a tower high speaking fee for her husband.
Barack Obama is very clear in spreading error concerning the Lord. He even *claims* to be a Christian. While Bill Clinton has claimed that as well—and perhaps Hillary has *mentioned* that she is—and even had a pastor praying for them during their inauguration, there clearly was no doubt that either of the couple was practicing religion. Obama on the other hand, went to church, and even after he did not go anymore he still claimed he went to service, but to a private one in his weekend retreat, in Camp David. There is even a book written about his religion, that even though he is on the liberal say, he "really is a Christian". That part of the back flip seemed like the author wanted to defend Obama's faith so badly. But irony is that this only makes his faith less credible, for anyone with faith does not need to say it out loud, it will be shown through his actions. In the case of Obama he showed clearly that he was against the life God created by funding abortion clinics in Africa and in the States, *Planned Parenthood*, by not loving the land and people of God, Israel, nor His other people in the Middle-East. 
Obama was the worst in spreading error concerning the Lord, but seemed less like he was practicing ungodliness; The Clintons were the worst in the latter, but less in the former. This verse, however, clearly states that one needs to suffice both characteristics #todo/opzoeken  [voldoen aan beide eigenschappen] to be a fool. I am sure they have done both, we just do not see it very well. 

*7 Scoundrels use wicked methods,*
*they make up evil schemes*
*to destroy the poor with lies,*
*even when the plea of the needy is just.*

Of course, as said, the poor are the ones who suffer the most. While voting mostly for the Democrats, they have been abandoned even more by actions such as ObamaCare and the funding of Planned Parenthood. The poor and the illegal foreigners do not get contraceptive aids and get pregnant, and once pregnant, they go to Planned Parenthood, where they are not advised to let their baby be adopted but to be aborted, so that Planned Parenthood can make money and even an extra amount of money by selling the organs. 
They lie to the people all the time. Whereas in Malaysia the Malay politicians are honest in telling immigrant Indonesians they get a permit and the right to vote *if and only if* they vote for the Malay parties, in the United States the Democrats are hypocritically the party who cares for the immigrants and therefore allow *all* immigrants just to gain votes from other-ethnical Americans who *do* have the right to vote, such as Mexican-Americans. 
In America only America-born citizens have the right to vote, but many of those are Mexican or Hispanic. They will empathize more with a party who allows their family and relatives from Mexico or other Latin countries and vote for these parties. These Hispanic-Americans are acting in their own interest of course, perhaps not knowing that their vote has multiple backlashes. The first of many being that these immigration policies (which the Democrats stand for, for which they voted) allow many criminals from Hispanic countries as well. A second one being that the Democrats are actively planting Planned Parenthood clinics in minority municipalities to "exterminate" them afterwards, while making money of it at the same time, from both the tax payer (by tax-funded subsidies) and by the illegal sale of baby organs. 

The Democrats use evil schemes. Sometimes these schemes are so intricate they I even wonder if they have thought this out or that it just happened to be in their advantage? Food stamps, for example, are another example of how Obama, among others, used the poor to his advantage. By increasing the number of food stamps the poor stay poor, because there is no incentive to work, but they have enough to eat. Most of the poor will vote for the Democrats, because they have the image of taking care of the poor. This image is created because the Democrats are the ones who were proponents of immigration (as mentioned above, and most immigrants are poor), food stamps, abortion—to help young girls pursue their education and careers, instead of becoming a single young mom—and affirmative action. All are *so-called* help and opportunities for the poor to climb the ladder of success.
The people of America, however, do not realize that the ladder consists of hard work and moral values. I would say the whole practice of being a Christian. The Democrats are—in practice—"fixing" or relieving *some* of the symptoms, at a great cost, which eventually will only make things worse. Instead of helping young girls pursue their education—for example, by providing knowledge about safe sex, no sex before or outside of marriage, and adoption possibilities, and by helping young men to stay pure and take care of their family—they promote free sex, they stimulate young men and women (even boys and girls) with pornographic or other graphical forms of sexuality, which logically leads to no restraints, unsafe sex and childbirth outside of marriage.
They are starting and extinguishing the fire at the same time at the high emotional cost of young girls who are damaged for life, some who can never give birth again, one out of ten being in life threatening situations, while the other nine have less, but still serious injuries, not to even mention the psychological impact on them, such as regret. 
It also comes at a great monetary cost for the tax payer. 

*8 But the noble make noble plans,*
*and by noble deeds they stand.*

I would not say the noble are in this illustration depicted by the Republicans, because these too are merely acting out of selfish interests, many of whom are not Christian and lead a separate immoral life outside of politics and are more center then right, or worst case, are wolves hidden in sheep clothes, such as [Eric Brooks, #todo/opzoeken juiste naam] who in fact is a Democrat, considering his stance on every point and the job he works at, CNN! 
Because man does not have any nobility in him, he can only obtain that by following the Law of the Spirit, which is given through God's Word. They should only follow that and man will call them noble. 
A man who gives his life and his wealth to the poor, just because Jesus told him to, will be called noble, regardless of his intentions—unless these are too noticeable. 
The Republicans are conservative and want to conserve the Constitution, which in itself is based on the Bible. That is one step towards a noble plan. If they can continue in this, the world will be a whole lot different. 
In this case the punishment for naivety comes even faster, in a year's time! If only things in these days were to come this fast. 
On the one hand there would a great loss for the women I care for, but on the other hand it would be over soon and we could make a fresh start sooner as well. 

**The Women of Jerusalem**
*9 You women who are so complacent,*
*rise up and listen to me;*
*you daughters who feel secure,*
*hear what I have to say!*
*10 In little more than a year*
*you who feel secure will tremble;*
*the grape harvest will fail,*
*and the harvest of fruit will not come.*

Complacent women are everywhere. I have seen them when I was young and I still see them every day. Not only women by the way, men as well. But women, especially, are too careless. It especially bothers me too see (so-called) Christian women behaving in the same way. They are listening to ungodly music and following ungodly women. They want to make money to travel a lot and they do not plan for the future.
I have—of course—three young women in mind from the Sunday school where I taught: Anli, MouShan's sister [#todo/opzoeken ] and Jia Jia. Three young girls who were noticeably on a descending slope in their moral values, discipline and materialism that kept mimicking secular behavior. At the same time, and this cannot be any different, the distance between God and them kept increasing. 
The other women I have in mind are those on the street, in the train, in every day life, especially those who have a career and sufficient income, a husband and children and perhaps a happy marriage. They have everything, they feel secure. But they do not realize what they are missing. They do not realize that everything they believe in is a lie. The whole theory of evolution of how people came to be, is a lie. They are living without a purpose and their life is a ticking time bomb. I feel sorry for them, because they do not know what is coming at them

*11 Tremble, you complacent women;*
*shudder, you daughters who feel secure!*
*Strip off your fine clothes*
*and wrap yourselves in rags.*
*12 Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields,*
*for the fruitful vines*
*13 and for the land of my people,*
*a land overgrown with thorns and briers —*
*yes, mourn for all houses of merriment*
*and for this city of revelry.*

These women who have lived in fine houses all of their lives, do not know that soon all of this will come to an end. Their soft hands without blisters or [eelt, #todo/opzoeken ] will soon be as hard as that of a carpenter, and not without incurring the pain and scars needed to get there. 
Women too shall labor on the field. Not only in pressing wine or [strohalmen uitkloppen, cf. eerder hoofdstuk in Isaiah #todo/opzoeken ] but the same labor as men do, for men will not be there anymore, except for children.
No one tended the land, so the land got overgrown with thorns and briers. Now, the women realize they have to do this, but still there are not enough women who can tend the land, because they are taking care of their children. 

*14 The fortress will be abandoned,*
*the noisy city deserted;*
*citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland forever,*
*the delight of donkeys, a pasture for flocks,*
*15 till the Spirit is poured on us from on high,*
*and the desert becomes a fertile field,*
*and the fertile field seems like a forest.*
*16 The Lord’s justice will dwell in the desert,*
*his righteousness live in the fertile field.*
*17 The fruit of that righteousness will be peace;*
*its effect will be quietness and confidence forever.*

God will inflict his punishment on the peoples. That is righteousness. Though many may not understand that, even if righteousness is part of His character. But they will understand when they see the fruit. This fruit is peace, quietness and confidence. 
It is the same kind of people who do not understand that righteousness leads to righteous children. And the lack of implementation of righteousness will lead to stubborn and undisciplined children who will mess up the world, taking away the above-mentioned things: peace, quietness and confidence. A world without these things is not a world living for. But we may know that this world does have these, if only God takes the opportunity to change things and if we are willing to obey Him. For if we do not, then we will all be finished and then peace will be here indeed, but not in the way we expected it. 

*18 My people will live in peaceful dwelling places,*
*in secure homes,*
*in undisturbed places of rest.*
*19 Though hail flattens the forest*
*and the city is leveled completely,*
*20 how blessed you will be,*
*sowing your seed by every stream,*
*and letting your cattle and donkeys range free.*

This peacefulness is not expressed in terms of material prosperity. The city and nature are leveled completely, but still God considers us blessed. This is possible because there is something more important material prosperity, it even goes beyond physical health or longevity, or having many children or people around you. It is the peace that God can give. 
Why is peace so important? Let me ask you the other way around. What kind of effect does unrest have on you? This unrest is what bothers people most. Wherever people die of suicide, it is of unrest. They do not feel content with their lives, they do not feel that people love them and they have unrest because they know that is not correct; They *need* to be loved. 
Whenever people get addicted to something it is because of unrest. They drink because they do not feel pleasant, they have no rest. They use drugs to forget about something. Later on in their addiction their unrest is partially due to the addiction itself, i.e. they have unrest because their body does not have what it needs. 
Whenever people hurt others it is because of unrest. They hurt because they are insecure themselves, i.e. they feel like others are looking down on them and they need to act tough in order to gain this synthetic peace of mind, thinking that they are tough.
Unrest is the cause of all sin, I would say, though never phrased like that in any book—or in the Bible. Arrogance could a root, the love for money, selfishness, etc. but never unrest. That is because unrest is a consequence of selfishness and the love for money, etc. But whatever root cause, unrest is a consequence of that, one of the basic feelings we try to avoid or cure.
