# Isaiah 59 (ESV)
**Evil and Oppression**
*1 Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save,*
*or his ear dull, that it cannot hear;*
*2 but ::your iniquities have made a separation*::
::*between you and your God,*::
::*and your sins have hidden his face from you*::
::*so that he does not hear.::* #biblestudy/memorization/todo

This is such a relief to hear, to know that God *is able*. We should know this already—that God can save everyone He wants, although we still doubt when do not see any salvation. We think that when He does not reply, He has not heard us, that is why we shout harder. Or worse, we do know that He has heard us but that He does not want to help us and is therefore a cruel God. 
The truth is, however, that we are too sinful and that God—though He *can* hear us—does not *want* to hear us. 
This is a relief not only to know that He has heard us, so we do not have to repeat ourselves—and it also means that God knows what we feel like—but because there is a way for us to be heard again. It is to get rid of our sins.

*3 For your hands are defiled with blood*
*and your fingers with iniquity;*
*your lips have spoken lies;*
*your tongue mutters wickedness.*

One's fingers easily get dirty. It is hard not to get them dirty, because with what else would we touch things? But getting our hands dirty means that we have grabbed that thing and put it in our hands. 
Having wicked words on your tongue is a problem we all have, some manage to not speak them out loud, or simply mutter them softly, but others do not manage and defile their lips. 
In this case it is about (most of) the Jews, but I think we can apply this to ourselves as well. Who can say he has only sinned little? Not as in frequency, but even in the seriousness of the sin? Everyone has sinned seriously. 
Although some people I encounter at Celebrate Recovery really do not have any problems. They come in as clean as you can see one. No addictions and with a healthy diet. Never hurt anyone and even their (sane) children are praising the parent. I was not able to find anything negative about these persons, but then again, I do not know them that well. But even the ones I do know better, and who do have some negative habits, have they sinned seriously? I cannot imagine they have, but I can believe it, for some sins that seem small to us, can be large in God eyes. 

*4 No one enters suit justly;*
*no one goes to law honestly;*
*they rely on empty pleas, they speak lies,*
*they conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity.*

Does this really mean "no one"? Yes, that is what it says here. Even Daniel and his friends, who were in the generation about which Isaiah is speaking here. It is only through God's grace that the holy people found the courage to be honest in court, regardless of the consequence, like Martin Luther prayed before his day in court before the emperor #todo/opzoeken or pope? 
before he refused to recant his work. 
But many of us do not have or accept the grace of God and they are as described in this verse. I too am guilty of that. 
Before I am called to stand "trial", because of something I have done wrong at work or before a serious conversation with my wife, I think of all the arguments to defend myself—even those that are on the brink of truth, and sometimes even passing that boundary. 
Everyone is afraid, ultimately. Though some say they are not afraid to get reprimanded, to go into jail or even to get the death penalty, no one likes it and everyone still tries to avoid it by circumventing justice and honesty. 

*5 They hatch adders' eggs;*
*they weave the spider's web;*

Once again I see references to the political Left in the United States, to which "they" in verse 5 is referring. Surely, the Left are not the adders themselve. They are not the ones committing the crimes, not visibly though. But they are the ones making these crimes possible, they "hatch" them, so to speak. 
They have made sure that the criminal gangs like *MS-13* are allowed entrance through the border which currently does not have a wall. Is this a coincidental by-product for their main agenda point to allow illegal immigrants? I do not think so. These criminals create chaos and it is in the midst of chaos where everything is relativized #todo/opzoeken ask Bo to correct this sentence. 
Just like the protagonist in the movie *Schindler's List* was only able to create profitable companies in war times, so the Left can say that their solution "is not ideal, but given the situation, it is the best we can do". 
I am referring to abortions then, more social control, bigger government, higher taxes and more control of the money. All of these are part of the web to control humans and make themselves more powerful and rich. 
Abortions are the second type of brood of vipers to carry out the Left's plan—knowingly, it must be mentioned—through *Planned Parenthood*, although many pro-choice people are unknowingly entwined in the Left's strategy. (See also my previous notes on abortion.)
What better example can be given for the chaos in the beginning of the 20th century, when black people were getting rights and white women fell in love with black men—or for the rising numbers in crime by young delinquents and men of lower intelligence? As shown in the series *The Knick* this gave perfect way for at least one doctor to commit *eugenics*, which at one time a Supreme Court Justice even allowed or advised. So morally corrupt is the human being, and even well-educated men—not only by chaos, but fueled by it—when they let themselves be led by their own feelings. 

*he who eats their eggs dies,*
*and from one that is crushed a viper is hatched.*

What is even worse is that these vipers are hard to impossible to kill. Once the viper is out, it is already on a slaughtering path and—as with everything, but in this case more clearly—it can only be stopped by divine intervention.
The easiest way would then be to kill the eggs. However, if you eat the eggs, you die, if you crush the egg, the viper will still come out alive. 
To give live examples of these take a look at the processes before and during the abolishment of slavery. How many Republicans have been killed to support these movements? I do not know whether this egg of slavery was eaten or crushed, but in the analogy of being crushed, it is clear that a viper, though smaller, still hatched from it, which is racial segregation, and after the Jim Crowe laws and voting for black people. 
But even after these vipers get smaller or less in number, new vipers keep hatching. 
Now, most of the black community has even turned on the Republicans. They have been misled into thinking that it is the Democrats who have helped them with (subsidized) abortion facilities in ethnic minority neighborhoods to help the young pregnant women to continue their careers. They think that Democrats are aiding single moms and other people on a lower scale on the social ladder with food coupons and social welfare and that the Republicans are witholding that from them. The truth cannot be farther from that!
Many examples exist, in all countries, but I can speak only of first-hand testimonies in the Netherlands, where people are less inclined to get a job if the end-result of the job is only a little more or even less than the financial benefits of social welfare. And single moms get to see their child, because they do not work, while working moms do not. Social welfare implemented in the wrong way is destroying the economy and the lives of people in our society. 
Eating the eggs have poisoned and almost killed the Republicans. What then the solution to all this? 
The greater and smaller vipers have been destroyed, thanks to God's divine intervention in the Civil War and in votes. But the Right and the Christians may have been struck by poisonous bites during the fight. How do we get healed? 
We let Christ fight the fight. This means that we need to get down on our knees and pray. We need to stick to our rule of going out and making disciples for Jesus Christ and teaching them His commands. If only we have been steadily doing that, and perhaps working even less on politics, I am sure that in the long run more will be achieved in our advantage, because it will then be Jesus' work, which is perfect, Who is immune to the snake's bites and Who does not worry about voting outcomes or new vipers that hatch, for He crushes them—the vipers that is, not the eggs—under His heel and Who can rise from the dead, should He die. 

*6 Their webs will not serve as clothing;*
*men will not cover themselves with what they make.*
*Their works are works of iniquity,*
*and deeds of violence are in their hands.*

Whatever the Left is concocting, it is not for the good. It is not like clothing that will protect you from harm or from the cold. They will not even use what they have made themselves. Which Democrat in office uses or has any use of Obamacare? Do they care about illegal immigration? No. As long as they can stay in the isolated areas, they do not care about the rest of the world. 
Which product did they make that was good for the people of America? I cannot think of one. On the other hand, everything they was good for them, except for taxing the rich, because that would mean they would be taxed more as well. However, it is the people who own more than 100 million or something who would be taxed at 90%, most Democrats are not near that threshold, so in that case they would be safe. They would steal from their own Democrats though, such as the owners of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, but not from their own pockets. Even that line—of their own people—they are willing to cross. 

*7 Their feet run to evil,*
*and they are swift to shed innocent blood;*
*their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity;*
*desolation and destruction are in their highways.*

Have the Democrats ever run away from violence? No, not only politicians, but all of the people supporting them. The *Ku Klux Klan* is one such party as well as the mobs that attack black people, and nowadays those who support Trump—innocent people who merely speak out their opinion, or often not even that, through their clothes. 

*8 The way of peace they do not know,*
*and there is no justice in their paths;*
*they have made their roads crooked;*
*no one who treads on them knows peace.*

It is difficult to say the one does not "know" peace. It would be like asking a criminal "do you know what peace is?" Of course he does. He has had this in his life before he became a criminal and he knows what the word means. 
However, there are two things that must be remarked here. First, do they know what *real* peace is? Second, the first part of verse 8 speaks of the "way of peace", not "peace" in itself. 
About the first thing, I do not think that anyone who has ever experienced real peace would want to go away from it. Surely, some people from Christian homes have left the pad of Christ, but the relative peace they had in their homes was due to the peace in their parents' hearts. They might have seen the peace in others, but not experienced it in themselves. I would dare to say the real peace of the possession of the Holy Spirit are one and the same. Anyone who has experienced it, would not want to leave. 
Saul had experienced it, but his wicked and jealous heart allowed him to lose the Spirit. He wanted the Spirit back, but was not willing to change. Would this be an exception then to what I have written above? No. What I am saying is, everyone who has experienced this peace might leave it, but would want to get back to it. 
Of course the situation for Christians is different. We have this peace and we might feel less of it when we sin, but the longing for this peace will get us back to striving towards a life without sin—which is possible, due to the Holy Spirit living in us. Saul could not get back to his peaceful life because he had already lost the Spirit. 
#church/material  If criminals-to-be have ever experienced this peace in their younger years, they would have felt the loss of this peace as soon as they commit their first crime. This is also a way of God telling us that something is wrong, when we lose our peace. Then this would lead them back on the right path and through the strength of the Holy Spirit they would succeed in that and never become a criminal. 

The second part is about the *way* of peace. One might know peace, it is a feeling. But how does one get it? Divine intervention is one thing, it is given to us through grace. But most often it is combined with faith in Jesus Christ and the love and Almight of God. If God tells a person to sell his house, this person could have peace before he even decides to sell his house—which is in the first situation, through God's grace—or he could be hesitant and pray about it, putting his trust in Jesus Christ and then receive peace—which is also given through grace, but in combination with putting his trust in God. 
Peace usually does not come by itself, it comes on a way. Just like "human" peace between people does not come by itself, one needs to take back a step and compromise, so "divine" and spiritual peace requires something of us. This is the way we need to walk. 
The statement in this verse is that the Israelites to whom Isaiah is speaking do not know the way of peace and have known peace itself. My addition to that is that that is true, for otherwise they would have returned to it. 

*9 Therefore justice is far from us,*
*and righteousness does not overtake us;*
*we hope for light, and behold, darkness,*
*and for brightness, but we walk in gloom.*

The perspective changes from the third person to the first. Is Isaiah speaking of the same persons, or is he saying that because of actions of the "really wicked" people described in verses 5 to 8, we now do not have justice? 
I think verse 4 gives the answer to that. It says that *everyone* sins, they all lie. Then the next four verses are about the same people, that is everyone. 
I still have some doubts about this interpretation, because even though Isaiah is sinful as well, this does mean, given my interpretation in verse 8, that Isaiah too has never known real peace. Perhaps, though, we may speak of exceptions here. Yes, everyone has sinned, but not everyone is really wicked, there are some who are righteous.
But a good conclusion would be that for both reasons justice is far from the Israelites. Both the wicked people in their country prevent them from being saved and the iniquities of the people themselves, all of them, prevent the Israelites from truly worshipping the Lord. For if God rescued the nation, He would rescue the wicked as well and if He rescued only the righteous, then most of the Israelites would perish by God's wrath. No, it is because of the righteous few that God does not destroy the entire population, and because of His promise to Abraham, that He will always be their God. 

*10 We grope for the wall like the blind;*
*we grope like those who have no eyes;*
*we stumble at noon as in the twilight,*
*among those in full vigor we are like dead men.*

Sin causes spiritual blindness in man. The blind cannot walk unless they feel the wall, that is all that can guide them. But what direction does a wall give? You do not know where to go, unless you know on which side of the wall you are standing. You might not even know which wall you are touching, or in which country you are. It might be the Berlin Wall or the Great Wall of China. 
The blind grope around them, but you never know what you will touch beforehand. You might touch a snake and get bitten or you might grope the wrong sinful things. This is so clearly seen in rebellious youth who rebel and leave home, and then blindly grope around until they touch something. Most of the times it is something bad—such as sex—if not criminal—such as drugs and alcohol. 
Those who drink stumble at twilight, for then they would have drunk too much, and those who do not drink, might still stumble, for they cannot see where they are walking. But the blind stumble without drinking at noon, because they cannot see even with light around them. The blind cannot see all the goodness God has given them, all the people around them loving them.
A lack of knowledge and wisdom are not the problem here, it might right in front of them, but would not be able to grab it and use it or ask it questions. A question like "show me the way" would be of no help, for they cannot see the direction or even walk it  without #todo/opzoeken  afdwalen from it. 
Those in full vigor, the ones who are spiritually strong and healthy show the biggest contrast with the blind, which can only be seen through spiritual eyes. An old and poor widow living according to God's law could be the large vigorous man in God's eyes, while the rich lawyer who has everything in the world's eyes could be the blind cripple, not knowing where to go to, not able to walk and not willing to ask for directions.

*11 We all growl like bears;*
*we moan and moan like doves;*
*we hope for justice, but there is none;*
*for salvation, but it is far from us.*

Those who transgress, even those who are criminal, still long for justice. No matter how ironic, they long for it, even when they are still committing crimes. Criminals too have feelings and had rather that their children grow up in a safe environment without violence and some succeed in it, by making a lot of money and sending their children to a boarding school instead of the local school. But the petty criminals do not get this chance and they long for justice, so that the streets will be clean and safe for their children. 
However, they are poisoning other people with drugs, people with children themselves. Maybe they care, but they have no other choice—they think. It is the only way for them to provide for their family. 

But in requesting justice, they are putting judgment over themselves as well. Are they willing to go to jail as well? I do not think that that is what they want. If they really wanted justice, then self-sacrifice is the first thing that needs to be done. Not in the sense of: 
> if every drugsdealer is caught, then I will allow myself to be imprisoned as well  
but rather 
> I will give up myself to the police first. No matter what other people will do.   

*12 ::For our transgressions are multiplied before you,*::
::*and our sins testify against us;*::
::*for our transgressions are with us,*::
::*and we know our iniquities:*::

Our transgressions, no matter how few we have, are multiplied before the Lord. I would even say they are exponentially multiplied. It is like we are looking at our transgressions on a log scale, but God is looking at the actual number. 
Our sins testify against us. How many sins have we not committed? They are too many to count. Some may be even too subtle to be seen. Some sins are multiple sins at once, for example when we rebel against God, we are proud as well, and disobedient, we are haughty, for we think we know better than God etc. 
Maybe the number of sins is countable, but the effect of it surely is not. In God's eyes, perfection is unreachable and any number if is at an unlimited number away from it, no matter how big. So perfection in this case is zero sins and zero negative effect, but any sin, no matter how small, even the (in our eyes) small sin of Eve to "merely" disobey God, without any direct consequence to others, was big enough to transform the perfect world to what it has become right now, including the effect of the flood. 
For no matter how beautiful we should find our Earth, with its mountains and oceans, it was perfect before the Fall and the Flood. Nature has a lot of death in it and is by no means perfect anymore. We have not seen the rotten corpses of fishes being eaten by ugly fishes and #todo/opzoeken  weekdieren
because it is too dark and because they hide down there, not wanting to be seen.

If all of the above is incomprehensible then just look at the last verse. *We know our iniquities.* Is that alone not enough proof for the seriousness of our sins? Can any person say that his sins have not affected the world, with more than just a *butterfly effect*? My sins have (in part) formed my brother, my son, my wife, even my parents, not even to speak of all the wreckage I have left behind in other people's lives—and all of this damage will keep on multiplying until they find God and until God has fully removed this imperfection on them (caused by me). But even when God has done that, they too have caused damage to others which will continue to spread and fester until they end of their lives. 
It is too big of an understatement to say that a single sin of mine will have impact for a hundred generations. #quotes/church

*13 transgressing, and denying the Lord,*
*and turning back from following our God,*
*speaking oppression and revolt,*
*conceiving and uttering from the heart lying words.*

You may think that you have transgressed against the Lord, but not that seriously, not in the sense that you have denied Him and have even stopped following Him. Let alone saying that He oppresses you and that we should rise and revolt against Him. No, we do not think we would ever say such things, speaking lies about our own God. 
But verse 13 says we do. We deny our God everytime we choose something over Him. At the moment we are consciously sinning, for example we are drinking one beer too much, and as we are grabbing it we know we should not, but we saying to God "Get behind me" so that God does not interrupt us anymore. 
We might say that that does not mean we have stopped following our God, but it is in that instant that you are not following Him. 
#quotes/church *On the road to heaven there are no pitstops.*
If you stop, you are not following Him.
Then what about oppression and revolt, have we all done that? I can certainly mention "Christians" who used to have good intentions, but who have spoken of oppression when I confronted them with #todo/opzoeken uit de bediening gezet
because they were in a relationship with a nonbeliever, and revolted by speaking of  me negatively, of course using lies. 
But has everyone done that? I must think hard here and be honest with myself. Surely I have lied and denied Christ, perhaps mostly in the period I was living together with my girlfriend and hanging with a wrong person, Ebuzer, but I do not remember revolting against God. 
Have I told anyone that God oppressed me? I do not remember complaining to anyone about the multitude of rules in the Bible.
But surely, I am more than willing to believe I have done so, for I know the heart of man is wicked and is capable of eating one's own mother. 

**Judgment and Redemption**
*14 Justice is turned back,*
*and righteousness stands far away;*
*for truth has stumbled in the public squares,*
*and uprightness cannot enter.*

I am not sure what "justice is turned back" means. Has it turned back or has it turned its back? For how can justice return when righteousness stands far away? This is only possible when there is justice, i.e. police and other enforcers of the law, but without righteousness, i.e. they do not follow the law of righteousness but rather their own evil and corrupt hearts. 

When truth stumbles in the public square, society is only going downwards. If it stumbles in a church, it is the same. In our former church, CCGN in Rotterdam, this was the case (cf. the case aforementioned about the relationship with an unbeliever). Whenever someone sinned, I hardly saw truth walking upright to convince someone. No, it was with fear that truth was brought to that person, fear that this person would be hurt, would walk away, would gossip about our church, and fear that because of that less people would come to our church.
So sin gives birth to death. It is contagious. People follow others as examples and if they follow their sinful actions, they will become sinful and die as well. Death is contagious, just like #todo/opzoeken  zwarte benen
Truth cannot even walk anymore, let alone walking upright, it *stumbles*. It needs to time to get up and continue its walk, only to stumble again, because people do not give it access and or pave the way for it. They undermine and let it trip. 
Uprightness is not appreciated. I remember that many times I brought the truth forward, but the people could not accept it. Even the reverend of the church, reverend Choi, was willing to bend the rules for this person, even after she lived together with this unbeliever while not married, and reinstate her as a Sunday School teacher—without ever having implemented #todo/opzoeken tucht or giving her the chance to repent from her sins. 
What will happen to this church? It is only by God's grace that this church still live and that some are growing in the Spirit. Of course, this goes for every church, but this church is setting a trap for itself, precedents that attract followers, a lack of education and good examples of rebuking (in love). It is setting course for death, if it does not change its ways. 

::*15 Truth is lacking,*::
::*and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.*::

There is not enough truth in this world. The truth is present, but it is kept within closed doors. The authorities in this world are making every effort to prevent this truth from leaking out. How would they do this though? For truth is like light. Those who have seen the light, know the truth. Once you know the truth, there is no denial anymore, at least not in one's heart. 
Yes, there are those who have seen the light and hid, because they could not bear the light. But these people, I would say, have not actually been shined upon, they have seen the light in others and what it did to them and they could not bear to see that. 
So if truth is in a box and it is labeled *this box contains the truth*, they dare not open it. The enemy knows that this truth may make people doubt the enemy's "truth", and so he does not propagate it, but rather criticize. If the truth is written in books, it gets bad reviews by all people working for the enemy. Some have read it, but not understood it, and therefore criticize it. Others have read it and came to belief, which makes the enemy not curious, but even more critical of this book. 
But if they open up to it, or better said, if God opens their heart, they will see the light that shines through it—the light coming from the truth, which is God's Word. 
And when they see it, there is no escape from it, but to fall on their knees and to accept His loving grace. 

*and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.*
This too unfortunately is the truth. The people of this world do not even realize themselves that those who deviate from their thoughts are deemed as their enemies, even though they propagate tolerance and intolerance by Christians and all others.
It is not possible to be neutral. You either join evil or you become their prey.

*The Lord saw it, and it displeased him*
*that there was no justice.*
*16 He saw that there was no man,*
*and wondered that there was no one to intercede;*

The Lord waits, for He wants man to have a chance to correct his ways. But He sees everything and God has *feelings*, it displeases Him. How much are we displeased when we "see" injustice in a movie or on the news, on a screen? How much more so does God, Who really sees injustice with His own eyes, not *as if* He were there, but He actually is there, and even feels the feelings of both the transgressor and the victim? 
How long can you watch this injustice in movies like *13 Years a Slave*, *Blood Diamond* or other movies with slavery in it? In one of the last movies by Quentin Tarantino the protagonist could not even withhold himself and blew his cover, for he could not stand to watch himself doing nothing while poor slaves were being butchered. For us, the duration is about two hours. God, however, has been watching far longer than that and to Him, one second is like a thousand years.
Can you imagine how patient God is? Can you imagine how patient He is, knowing that God foreknew the future? He already knew that no man would intercede and still He waited, for the sake of free will and judgment, so that no man could say that God did not give him the chance to intercede. 

*then his own arm brought him salvation,*
*and his righteousness upheld him.*

But God will intercede. He will do it Himself if no one does it. How long does God need to wait before someone will intercede? God is sovereign and He is the only One Who may decide how long is enough. It is His *righteousness* that determines that enough suffering has taken place, enough rebellion and disobedience. 

*17 He put on righteousness as a breastplate,*
*and a helmet of salvation on his head;*
*he put on garments of vengeance for clothing,*
*and wrapped himself in zeal as a cloak.*

What first comes to mind is that God puts on this items Himself. He does not ask Michael, the leader of His angels to put this on, or Gabriel. No, He does this Himself. 
What comes second is the order of these items. If His breastplate comes first and is covered with clothing and a cloak, then people can see only His breastplate. In practice as well, it is only His vengeance and zeal that others see of God, as the atheist Richard Dawkins points out in his book *The God Delusion*, and he as well does not see what lies underneath, that is God's righteousness and His love. 
Though that overlooking may be forgiven for some, who have not read the Bible, since they do not know the full story, Dawkins is probably not forgiven, for he has studied the Bible for his book and he is so focused on this cloak that he misses what is so visibly put on God's head, the helmet of salvation. 
Dawkins completely ignores the point that God avenges to save His people. He writes that more than "x" #todo/opzoeken  percent of the Bible is about war, but how many of those wars were because the enemy attacked the Israelites first? How many of those wars did God not approve of and were instigated by man himself?
Of course, those who have studied the Bible thoroughly know that every war instigated and approved by God is one that is righteous, to protect His people from the wrong, unrighteous and pagan influences—and one that is won. As a matter of fact, every war God called the people of Israel to and to which they did not completely obey, ended in some disaster, no matter how small. See for example the war in Joshua #todo/opzoeken welk hoofdstuk
where the Gibeonites should have been completely slaughtered #todo/opzoeken  what was the eventual result? 
, the war against the ... #todo/opzoeken  see Saul 
where Saul himself lost the Holy Spirit and his anointing

#todo/opzoeken zalving = salvation, etymology

*18 According to their deeds, so will he repay,*
*wrath to his adversaries, repayment to his enemies;*
*to the coastlands he will render repayment.*

God will repay. That is the thing we need to remember. Of course there is more to Him than just repayment, but no matter whether we hear Him or not, we may know that God loves us, that He loves and is righteousness and that He will repay those with what they deserve. His adversaries deserve His wrath as do His enemies and the coastlands. The coastlands are probably the nations around the Mediterranean Sea, which have always indulged and would still do so in the coming 1000 years approximately in foreign gods and their idols. Their paganism would go to extremes, perhaps not as extreme as Baal and Ashtarte's, which promoted or perhaps enforced sex with statues, or Molech's, which forced human sacrifices of newborns, but still very sinful. 
I do not know much about the European pagan religions before the Greek ones #todo/opzoeken , but the Greek one has influenced present day culture, so I can speak a little on the effects of it. Continuous lust, pleasure, materialism and accompanied by envy, criminality and sexual immorality are the results of this culture. We see these things in other cultures as well, like the Indian, Chinese and Middle-Eastern ones, but in a much less severity. It is also clear that when the West has obtained a foothold in those countries, these Western characteristics rise steadily. 
Now the West is formed by two things, Christianity and Greek philosophy. The first one giving good fruits to the West, the second one damnation. 

*19 So they shall fear the name of the Lord from the west,*
*and his glory from the rising of the sun;*
*for he will come like a rushing stream,*
*which the wind of the Lord drives.*

Just like God's unlimited love which continues day and night, so the fear of His Name will be continuous as well. Wherever the sun rises, which is all of the Earth in a whole day, there will be fear for Him.  
Now we know that some parts of the world do not have any believers. Especially in ancient times when the conquest had not taken place yet.  

Perhaps what is meant here, is that there would always be someone who fears God and that has always been true. From the time of Seth on, people have been calling on the Name of the Lord.  
Another interpretation is that the day has not passed yet. Like the sun rises in the east and slowly goes to the west, literally, so the Gospel slowly spreads across all nations and peoples. By the end of the figurative day in every people there will be at least one who fears God (cf. Matthew 14:...). 

Still another interpretation is that when God shows His greatness there is none who will not fear. And this time not fear Him out of respect, but actually fear Him because they are afraid. For no one dares to stand before God. Everyone, even the demons, are afraid of the Name of Jesus, let alone His presence. God has merely been gracious to the peoples of this world, some of whom have never seen western civilization and been in contact with the Gospel, others, though living in contact with the Western world, have never actually understood the Gospel, such as those who have been brought up in an atheistic environment.  
However, even those brought up in "Christian" environments could not have heard the Gospel, if they were brought up in strict and religious, moralistic environments where no love is shown. On the other hand, those who have been brought up in the right environments, could still not accept the Gospel due to their own stubbornness.  

*20 “And a Redeemer will come to Zion,*
*to those in Jacob who turn from transgression,” declares the Lord.*

Jesus has come, to Jerusalem, to the Jews but only to those who turn from transgression and repent. It is hard to see why the Jews did not see this verse. It is written multiple times in the Bible that repentance is required to be stand in front of God, why then did all the Jews think that the Redeemer, Who is the Messiah, would come as a political figure to defeat the Romans. What would that have to do with repentance? 
Jesus did not come to redeem the Jews from the Romans, but from their own sin that would accuse them. #church/material

*21 “And as for me, this is my covenant with them,” says the Lord: “My Spirit that is upon you, and my words that I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouth of your offspring, or out of the mouth of your children's offspring,” says the Lord, “from this time forth and forevermore.”*

This is a difficult verse to explain. I know or have heard of so many people who believe in God, show the fruit of His work in their lives, and still their children do not believe in God anymore—in the second generation already, let alone in the third. I know of people who are much holier than I am to which this has happened. Why is that so? 
Of course, it is by grace that our children live and—if they know God—that they know God. But would that not contradict what He has said and promised here? #biblestudy/questions

God used the phrase "the Spirit in your mouth". Does God mean that the people have the blessing of always being able to speak about Him, but not always more than just using words? This seems very illogical. God has always been a proponent of when saying something and meaning it.
Or is the promise fulfilled when out of all children there is at least one person that will keep worshipping God, while the rest may stray away? That too seems like a meager promise—even though it is still bigger than anything we could ever accomplish, for this promise lasts *forever*.
I understand the first part of the promise, namely that God's Spirit will never depart us. In order to depart something it had to have entered it first. So this means that those who have the Spirit, will never be without it. But does this promise say that (all of) our offspring will get the Holy Spirit as well? No. That is not what it is saying. So the promise is only referring to the departure of the Spirit and the accompanying trust in God's Word, and this promise holds forever. 
Still, that interpretation does not completely satisfy me. It seems then as if this verse is a #todo/opzoeken strikvraag. bedrog. 
of what is actually promised. 
Another interpretation from MacSBNnkjv is that not every family gets this blessing, even if that the father of the household, for example, is a true follower of God. But as a whole generation, the next generation would most certainly not leave God's Word and His Spirit will still be upon them. 
That, as we see in practice, is still true. Before 400 BC the Israelites have never completely left God. His Spirit was always upon them as a whole, to protect them—even when we read in the Bible that the Israelites were attacked, it was led and planned by God—and individually it was on those who still worshipped Him.
After 400 BC God was silent, but people started worshipping Him again so His Word had not left them yet. Even until now there are still Jews who worship God and focus on His Words.
