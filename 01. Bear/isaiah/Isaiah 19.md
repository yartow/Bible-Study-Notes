# Isaiah 19
*Isaiah 19 (NIV)*

**A Prophecy Against Egypt**
*1 A prophecy against Egypt:*
*See, the Lord rides on a swift cloud*
*and is coming to Egypt.*
*The idols of Egypt tremble before him,*
*and the hearts of the Egyptians melt with fear.*
*2 “I will stir up Egyptian against Egyptian—*

Soon it will be the turn of Egypt to be punished. The Lord has spoken of Cush, which is further than Egypt, as if it has skipped Egypt. But she must not think that her fate will pass her. Everyone must meet her fate in her own way. Egypt will meet hers through internal strife and economic poverty. Where Egypt was the most affluent country in perhaps the whole of Africa, it would lose every business that depended on water, which is—as far as I know—everything. 

*brother will fight against brother,*
*neighbor against neighbor,*
*city against city,*
*kingdom against kingdom.*
*3 The Egyptians will lose heart,*
*and I will bring their plans to nothing;*
*they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead,*
*the mediums and the spiritists.*

Everything people do to contest God will only lead to worse. It is just like with the sea. It is better to float along with the water than to go against its stream. There will never be a day when man invents a machine that can make water of the sea flow back, or a machine that can stand up straight in the ocean which is 3 kilometers deep(cf. the movie *Pacific Rim*). Man does not even have the technology yet to make structures so strong and tall that it reaches a height of 6 kilometers (the tallest building as of this moment is only 600 meters (from the top of my mind)). Also, it does not have the capability to create big structures that can withhold extreme pressures that are found at the bottom of the sea. 
Anything the people create will be destroyed or it will destroy themselves. They will go as far as looking for the occult. They will do anything so long as it is not looking for God. Today's people look for all kinds of ways to get peace, which was in fact what the Egyptians were looking for, peace in their hearts. As long as they were safe, that would give them peace in their hearts, no matter what happened to other people. 
Nowadays people go for yoga, chakrastics, and all kinds of New Age practices, spiritualism, or semi-spiritual courses by Scientology and the so-called "mindfulness" stream just to get some piece of mind, not realizing it is exactly that, i.e. looking for the answer within themselves, that brought them this unrest. 

*4 I will hand the Egyptians over*
*to the power of a cruel master,*
*and a fierce king will rule over them,”*
*declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty.*
*5 The waters of the river will dry up,*
*and the riverbed will be parched and dry.*
*6 The canals will stink;*
*the streams of Egypt will dwindle and dry up.*
*The reeds and rushes will wither,*
*7 also the plants along the Nile,*
*at the mouth of the river.*
*Every sown field along the Nile*
*will become parched, will blow away and be no more.*

This punishment is not mainly to teach the Egyptians. Of course, there is always an aspect of teaching and in this case the Egyptians should learn not to follow other gods and not to hurt God's people. The Egyptians, however, had forgotten what happened to them 1600 years earlier, even though the Israelites had not. Why? Because they were ashamed of what happened and did not put those events in the records. The Israelites on the other hand do have all those events written in their records, which is the Bible, but also all (or most) of their other heinous events, in which the Israelites themselves were wrong. These are written down in the chronicles, in the Biblical books of Kings and Chronicles. God lets us write these things down so that they, but we too, will not forget and that we will learn from our mistakes. 

*8 The fishermen will groan and lament,*
*all who cast hooks into the Nile;*
*those who throw nets on the water*
*will pine away.*
*9 Those who work with combed flax will despair,*
*the weavers of fine linen will lose hope.*
*10 The workers in cloth will be dejected,*
*and all the wage earners will be sick at heart.*

As mentioned before, *everyone* will be affected, even the ones who work with clothes. What would they have to do with the Nile? In this case it is the flax that is made from reed that grows in the Nile. But even if it were clothes made from wool, the sheep would need grass and water, which are both fed by the river as well. Eventually (almost) everything is derived from water. Even if it is not directly linked, it is dependent of the transportation over the Nile, such as the rocks meant for the pyramids. 
God can take away that single thing that will affect us all. But look at it from the positive side. God can also give us that single thing that will grant everyone happiness, joy and peace. And that thing is not water. No He will give us water more; He will give us *living* water. The source of water that will never dry out and that we will always carry with us, wherever we are. 

*11 The officials of Zoan are nothing but fools;*
*the wise counselors of Pharaoh give senseless advice.*
*How can you say to Pharaoh,*
*“I am one of the wise men,*
*a disciple of the ancient kings”?*
*12 Where are your wise men now?*
*Let them show you and make known*
*what the Lord Almighty*
*has planned against Egypt.*

When people are measured against God or His people, none of them are wise. God created wisdom Himself. He put wisdom in humans. How then can so-called wise people try to defy the Maker of Wisdom? They are so foolish. 
But even in their wisdom (or knowledge) they have not obtained all of the wisdom, that is, they have forgotten to obtain humility. 

*13 The officials of Zoan have become fools,*
*the leaders of Memphis are deceived;*
*the cornerstones of her peoples*
*have led Egypt astray.*
*14 The Lord has poured into them*
*a spirit of dizziness;*
*they make Egypt stagger in all that she does,*
*as a drunkard staggers around in his vomit.*
*15 There is nothing Egypt can do—*
*head or tail, palm branch or reed.*

Just like the officials of the United States, the President and Congress, have mostly been fools when they did not follow God and acted on their own behalf. Officials who promise the country to make it better, without consulting with God first, are fools. Even if they make the country better in one particular area, is that what God would have wanted? Obama thought he did the best for African girls by giving them abortions.
Trump has cut unemployment, and though that in general is a good thing, it is not if it has not been consulted with God first. Although in this case, unemployment is a consequence of something else, the tax cut. Consequences in general are controlled by God. Companies, for example, could have used the money for other purposes as well. 

*16 In that day the Egyptians will become weaklings. They will shudder with fear at the uplifted hand that the Lord Almighty raises against them. 17 And the land of Judah will bring terror to the Egyptians; everyone to whom Judah is mentioned will be terrified, because of what the Lord Almighty is planning against them.*

God can change mighty world powers into weaklings. It would be something like changing Russia, or United Kingdom, former world powers, into weaklings. United Kingdom itself, as a matter of fact, is already economically in decline, its "kingdom" has steadily decreased from colonies all over the world to now, perhaps, only some islands in the pacific, besides the United Kingdom itself. 
I do not know where the United Kingdom's main (economic) power lies, but I would not be surprised if this is in the financial world, of which London is (one of the) centre(s), next to Tokyo and New York. 
If the United Kingdom's whole economy thrives on its financial center, than their situation is no different from that of Egypt who depended on the Nile. The United Kingdom will lose jobs once the stock market crashes and all [ambachten] will cease to exist as well. The only thing the United Kingdom will then be good for is cheap labor, but even then they would not surpass the low rates of India. In any case, Egypt, no matter how poor, has kept existing, at least until the Arabs, and so the United Kingdom probably will, though it may be in a different form. 
#todo/opzoeken  What happened with Egypt during and after the Assyrian invasion? 

*18 In that day five cities in Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the Lord Almighty. One of them will be called the City of the Sun.*
*19 In that day there will be an altar to the Lord in the heart of Egypt, and a monument to the Lord at its border. 20 It will be a sign and witness to the Lord Almighty in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the Lord because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, and he will rescue them.*

Even for all the bad Egypt has done, the people will not only be healed, but be brought to God as His children as well. Moreover, they will be a sign and witness to them, as the Israelites were meant to be, but which the Christians have been but now, unfortunately only sparsely are.
The Lord is forgiving and though He needs to punish, or better said, the Egyptians inflicted this punishment upon themselves, perhaps as a matter of cause and effect, He still loves His people to the end. Even the Pharaohs of Egypt, who abused His children for perhaps hundreds of years and towards the end must have caused hundreds or even more of them to die through his extreme "policies" for slavery, and most certainly the Pharaoh responsible for the killing of all male babies under three, yes even him, God has loved throughout the ages, wanting them and ever giving them the opportunity to repent and change.
Instead, however, they kept inflicting Israel and seeking war, perhaps as retribution for what the Israelites had done to them a thousand years ago. Even now, though the original Egyptians have disappeared and have now been replaced by the Arabs, Egypt is constantly seeking war with Israel, crossing lines and abusing Israel's moral values and longing for peace, drawing Israel out through killing their people and (letting Hamas) send out suicide bombers. 

*21 So the Lord will make himself known to the Egyptians, and in that day they will acknowledge the Lord. They will worship with sacrifices and grain offerings; they will make vows to the Lord and keep them. 22 The Lord will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the Lord, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them.*
*23 In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. 24 In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth. 25 The Lord Almighty will bless them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance. ”*
