# Isaiah 6 
**(NIV) Isaiah’s Commission**
*1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne; and the train of his robe filled the temple. 2 Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying. 3 And they were calling to one another:*
*“Holy, holy , holy is the Lord Almighty;*
*the whole earth is full of his glory.”*
*4 At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.*
*5 “Woe to me!” I cried. “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty.”*

I am going over these parts too fast because I have heard this part quite often. This does not mean that it is less important though. No, the opposite is true. It is because it is so important that I should stand still and give extra thought to this. 
It is not that a prophet acknowledges that he is sinful, that should surprise us. First of all, the prophet is only human. He has—most likely—have a better relationship with God than we do, which would imply for him to be less sinful that we are, but nonetheless he still is sinful. Second of all, he is a prophet and a leading example, in correct behavior as well, so it is only logical that he admits his sins. This part is not even about *admitting* per se, but more of stating the fact that he is sinful and that sinfulness in the presence of God is deadly. 
It is the latter that is often noted. However, it *should not* surprise us as Christians, but the surprising part is that it *does*. In this generation, we—both Christian and non-Christian alike—have forgotten the fact that sin can not be present with God at the same time. Jesus lived among sin and sinners, but sin was never in Him. Each one of us is one of those sinners and we expect God to live in us. This is not possible. Isaiah knows this and knows that he will die momentarily—or should have died instantly—if it were not for the grace of God. 
Another thing that is noteworthy is that Isaiah speaks of his unclean lips and that of those around him, for it is quite frequent that we sin with that part of our body, and—if I may say—with our mental lips as well, for our thoughts are sinful as well and lead to words actually spoken. 

*6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar. 7 With it he touched my mouth and said, “See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for. ”*

The meaning of this is that fire can cleanse us. Fire is, by definition, I would say, the cleanest thing on Earth. Unlike alcohol, which does exist and in which there could be bacteria that survive in extreme conditions, fire does not have anything in it. No bacteria or viruses live in it, for fire itself does not exist. It is merely the result of combining immense heat and fuel, but once the fuel is gone, the fire is gone as well.
I have thought of comparing the God or the Holy Spirit with fire, but that would be disrespectful or blasphemous, for it is actually the other way around. It is exactly because of the Holy Spirit's characteristics—i.e. it is pure, it is energy, fueled by love, righteousness and all of the other Spiritual characteristics of God, immaterial yet able to destroy everything and cleaning and "healing" everything in its path, that fire is created—that fire has been created, as an example and Earthly image of the Holy Spirit. 
As for "healing", fire creates charcoal of anything organic, and carbon has many healing properties. It can heal diarrhea, used as lubricant, filter water. In the same way the Holy Spirit can break down existing things and rebuild it from scratch so that new things can be created with it. For the above examples are only made of carbon, but if carbon is compressed it can be made into charcoal which is long burning and used to create the hottest fires to create metal. One step further and it becomes a diamond, the hardest "mineral" and even material, which is useful as a tool, to dig tunnels, cut through or polish hard materials, but mostly as a jewel, to be enjoyed and to please others. 
The spiritual example of this is how we as Christians can be used. 



Charcoal: we are supposed to be burning and giving warmth to others, not burning as wood, but as charcoal (cf. also the example of Christians as charcoal who need each other), and able, when we are put together and have enough oxygen, to burn the hottest ores (i.e. atheists and people with hardened hearts from other religions) to create the most beautiful metals (in the same analogy, C.S. Lewis, Josh McDowell and the father of archeology, Lee Strobel, Nabeel Qureshi).
Diamond: eventually we can be used for the hard work, and sometimes we will, though lesser known, many do not know about the missionaries and not all are called to be one, but we are meant to please God. [that in itself is enough]

*8 Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us? ”*
*And I said, “Here am I. Send me!”*
*9 He said, “Go and tell this people:*
*“‘Be ever hearing, but never understanding;*
*be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’*
*10 Make the heart of this people calloused;*
*make their ears dull*
*and close their eyes.*
*Otherwise they might see with their eyes,*
*hear with their ears,*
*understand with their hearts,*
*and turn and be healed.”*

This is quite a difficult passage to understand. What would God mean by this? He could be punishing people for being disobedient. He has given them multiple chances, but they did not repent and accept God's forgiveness, which he even offered in Isaiah 1:18. So now it is too late. 
But why would God then even bother to send Isaiah to tell them that from now on they will not understand anything anymore? This is a mystery for me too.

Sometimes it is better to not talk to people anymore if you do not want them to be part of your plan. If they are part of your team, you have a shared language, or a secret code. It is bonding between people and indicates trust. But if the code is changed without notifying the other, then that means the trust has been broken. 
God is not including His people in His plans anymore. He is even loudly proclaiming His plans but the people do not seem to be able to make words out of it. He is explicitly and publicly stating, though still subtle, that they are not His people anymore. More explicitly is the message that they will not understand anymore, but the message underlying this, is the message above. 

*11 Then I said, “For how long, Lord?”*
*And he answered:*
*“Until the cities lie ruined*
*and without inhabitant,*
*until the houses are left deserted*
*and the fields ruined and ravaged,*
*12 until the Lord has sent everyone far away*
*and the land is utterly forsaken.*

In the times of the Judges the people kept crying out for God, but only when it actually was too late. They were severely punished by God then through forces of nature, famine and attacks from the surrounding countries and peoples. God helped them each time, perhaps up to nine times.

This could have gone on for ages, although with each redemption from God, a small piece of land was gained or regained, or some of the enemies were killed. However, in return Israel might have lost land and many of its own people as well, so it is unclear whether each cycle of events was positive or negative. 
God's intention of course was for people to change, but after nine of those cycles, they even gave up on God and wanted a human king. They still wanted to imitate their neighboring countries.
Though the period of judges was past, the cycle in fact returned, for there were still prophets and kings. One could say that the coming of a good king, which was rare even in Judah, was an answer of the people's cry due to the bad results of the previous bad kings. 
Economic and spiritual poverty are very common backgrounds in the period of bad kings, though in the eras of the good kings, the economy was not great either, but perhaps because they were fixing all the damage of their predecessors. 
Eventually God wants to make an end to all of this, because He "notices" that the people never learn. They need something else right now. 
Of course God already knew this from the beginning of time, but to be "honest", He needed to give them a chance. Otherwise people looking in hindsight, such as we in our day, would blame God for not having given the Jews enough opportunities to repent. The irony is that even though God has given His people many more chances than they have deserved, and has written about this clearly, not even in symbols only, through His prophets Micah, Isaiah and Jeremiah, just to name a few, the people in our time *still* think that God is unfair. 

*13 And though a tenth remains in the land,*
*it will again be laid waste.*
*But as the terebinth and oak*
*leave stumps when they are cut down,*
*so the holy seed will be the stump in the land.”*

Even here, God's wrath is not unending. He will leave a stump from which everything can grow again. He has done that with the tribe of Benjamin (cf. Chronicles?) #todo/opzoeken  and with the Israelites during the siege of Assyria and Babylon, and even in the latter days during the Second World War. 
Whether this is applicable to Christians is not mentioned here in Isaiah, and I have not studied Revelations yet, but if we are on equal foot with the Jews as God's children, though adopted, then we may know that God will treat us the same.
