# Isaiah 22
**Isaiah 22 (NIV) A Prophecy About Jerusalem**
*1 A prophecy against the Valley of Vision:*
*What troubles you now,*
*that you have all gone up on the roofs,*
*2 you town so full of commotion,*
*you city of tumult and revelry?*
*Your slain were not killed by the sword,*
*nor did they die in battle.*

God is merciful but expects us to act accordingly. If we are punished according to our sins, we are not expected to mourn, for we got what we deserved. Perhaps we are allowed to be troubled if we are punished more than what we deserved, but that is rarely the case, given our sinful nature. However, if we are punished less than what we deserve, God does not expect us to be troubled at all.
This is the case with Israel. She deserved to be punished, to be slain and killed by the sword, but instead, God was merciful and sent Babylon to Jerusalem. Not the ruthless Assyrians who not only killed (most of) the people, men, women and children (even infants) alike, but also tortured them before killing them. 
No, the Babylonians were less ruthless and did *not* kill the Israelites, but had taken them captive. This is something to rejoice over! There is still hope, for God has not let us die yet. We are still in His hands and not in the hands of the enemy. God still has everything under control!
For these reasons alone the Israelites should have celebrated and repented, because God had not given up on them. Perhaps He would even have shortened the duration of captivity, which would be 70 years among the Babylonians and Persians in total. 
But the Israelites did not celebrate. The mourned for losing a country they loved, or so they thought, and in their own troubled hearts they forgot to thank the One God Who gave them what they still had left. Some still lived in Israel, and some were taken to the fruitful and beautiful (though heretic) kingdom of Babylonia. They do not realize how things could have been much worse. The Israelites could have been brought to Egypt, where there is scorching heat and where the Israelites were slaves 3000 years earlier. But instead, they could become working and integrated citizens. Daniel even got a position in the royal administration. Aside from the religious and ethnic discrimination, given their sin, this was the opportunity of a lifetime. Instead of being killed, one got to be taken captive and sent to a fruitful kingdom. 
I am picturing this more colorful that it probably would have been, but it is no matter what still a stark contrast to eternal damnation in hell, whereas now they still have the opportunity to repent. This opportunity, is the most valuable thing you can get from God. For without it, it is indeed only mourning and living with troubled hearts. 

So when it was time to mourn deeply and repent, the Israelites were celebrating. But now, when it is time to celebrate, you are mourning, yet not repenting. 

*3 All your leaders have fled together;*
*they have been captured without using the bow.*
*All you who were caught were taken prisoner together,*
*having fled while the enemy was still far away.*

It is a huge show of not trusting God when you are fleeing even before the enemy comes. If you trust God will and can win this war for you, you have to at least engage in this war. Just like the Levites (or priests #todo/opzoeken ) carrying the Ark had to set their foot in water first, before God would dispel the water, so the king and his army should have engaged in this fight, or at least followed up on God's commands. 
But not only did they abandon their hope in God, if they ever had any, they also abandoned the people they were supposed to look out for. 
God made it so easy for the enemy to catch the king and his army that bows were not even necessary. 
No matter what the circumstance look like, if you trust in God and do not act ahead of God, God *might* help you, depending on what He has promised. But most certainly, if you do *not* have any hope in God and abandon *your responsibilities* which God has given you, you can be sure that your demise will be coming sooner than you expected. And the thing you have been running from, will now get to you in an easier way than it would have, had you not run away.

*4 Therefore I said, “Turn away from me;*
*let me weep bitterly.*
*Do not try to console me*
*over the destruction of my people.”*
*5 The Lord, the Lord Almighty, has a day*
*of tumult and trampling and terror*
*in the Valley of Vision,*
*a day of battering down walls*
*and of crying out to the mountains.*
*6 Elam takes up the quiver,*
*with her charioteers and horses;*
*Kir uncovers the shield.*

What is the use of consoling another when death and destruction are still going on? One cannot tell the other any good things, for the dead are not in heaven, and one cannot say that God *might* help the Israelites for they are doing everything except His will.
God is looking at His children and He sees them killing each other. One is taking up the quiver and getting ready to attack, the other is taking his shield to protect Himself. 

*7 Your choicest valleys are full of chariots,*
*and horsemen are posted at the city gates.*
*8 The Lord stripped away the defenses of Judah,*
*and you looked in that day*
*to the weapons in the Palace of the Forest.*
*9 You saw that the walls of the City of David*
*were broken through in many places;*
*you stored up water*
*in the Lower Pool.*
*10 You counted the buildings in Jerusalem*
*and tore down houses to strengthen the wall.*
*11 You built a reservoir between the two walls*
*for the water of the Old Pool,*
*but you did not look to the One who made it,*
*or have regard for the One who planned it long ago.*

Not only are they destroying themselves and God's children (although they (Elam and Kir) were not Jewish or Christian, but I mean here that all people are created by God and in that sense they are His children), but they are destroying everything that God gave them to have a fulfilled life—the abundant life Jesus spoke of, the milk and honey the people in the Exodus dreamt of.
The valleys were supposed to be filled with vineyards or other fruits or vegetables. The city gates are supposed to be magnificent entrance to the city, showing the city's splendor and magnitude, even harboring the leaders of the city and their administration, but now it has become a place of fear and terror, filled with horses to scare off any oncoming enemy. 
Even the weaponry meant as art work in the House of the Forest was used for the war.
The same they did with the Old Pool that God has graciously granted them. In an area as dry as Israel this pool is literally a gift from God that should be treated with respect, but now it has become a mere human made reservoir. 
The worst thing is not the outer part. For it is normal that the water should be protected from where it can be contaminated, but the Israelites forgot Who it was Who made this pool and gave it to them. For example, it is perfectly understandable that if it gets cold you will need to burn books, paintings and perhaps even the Bible to stay warm in order not die from the cold, but one should at least understand that these books are handmade, what the value is of this painting and that the Bible is the Holy Word of God Himself. 
#church/material Use the example of the movie *The Day after Tomorrow* where books are being burnt and one person does not allow them to. 

*12 The Lord, the Lord Almighty,*
*called you on that day*
*to weep and to wail,*
*to tear out your hair and put on sackcloth.*
*13 But see, there is joy and revelry,*
*slaughtering of cattle and killing of sheep,*
*eating of meat and drinking of wine!*
*“Let us eat and drink,” you say,*
*“for tomorrow we die!”*

Now the Lord called the Israelites to be sad and repent. Of course there is no compulsory way to be sad, it has come naturally, but if one cannot be sad, it means that he does not care about the fate of his city and the people it inhabits. 
Whatever the reason, it says something about the person if he is not emotionally affected by everything that is happening. But slaughtering cattle and having feasts with lots of alcohol is the opposite of what God commanded. 
In a sense God gave them another chance, by repenting and perhaps then God would relent. But instead the leaders of Jerusalem chose to not go for God's mercy but rather die. Did they understand they were making this choice for everyone in the city, including those who did love God, and innocent children? 
This is why their punishment is so severe in the next verses. 

*14 The Lord Almighty has revealed this in my hearing: “Till your dying day this sin will not be atoned for,” says the Lord, the Lord Almighty.*
*15 This is what the Lord, the Lord Almighty, says:*
*“Go, say to this steward,*
*to Shebna the palace administrator:*
*16 What are you doing here and who gave you permission*
*to cut out a grave for yourself here,*
*hewing your grave on the height*
*and chiseling your resting place in the rock?*
*17 “Beware, the Lord is about to take firm hold of you*
*and hurl you away, you mighty man.*
*18 He will roll you up tightly like a ball*
*and throw you into a large country.*
*There you will die*
*and there the chariots you were so proud of*
*will become a disgrace to your master’s house.*
*19 I will depose you from your office,*
*and you will be ousted from your position.*

We often forget that even the most littlest things are gifts from God and granted by Him. For everything comes from God alone (cf. Colossians 1:16). Even the place where we die, the way we die and the way we are buried. 
Some might say, proudly, that they want to be buried in a wooden chest with this and that kind of setting, made of a special kind of wood; others will want their ashes spread in a specific ocean or river. But who is to say they get to decide what will be done with their remainders? Our lives are not ours, neither is our body, especially not when we have left it. 
In verse 18 God decided that Shebna would not die in a grave but out on the field, rolled like a ball and there his body would remain. 
God decided for Elijah and Henoch how they would die, where Moses would be buried, and where the wives of the forefathers would be buried. The best example of God's sovereignty over this is when God even predicted how His Son would be buried, thousands of years before the actual event. #todo/opzoeken  waar in de Bijbel?

*20 “In that day I will summon my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah. 21 I will clothe him with your robe and fasten your sash around him and hand your authority over to him. He will be a father to those who live in Jerusalem and to the people of Judah. 22 I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David; what he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. 23 I will drive him like a peg into a firm place; he will become a seat of honor for the house of his father. 24 All the glory of his family will hang on him: its offspring and offshoots—all its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars.*
*25 “In that day, ” declares the Lord Almighty, “the peg driven into the firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and will fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut down.” The Lord has spoken.*

Again the Lord prophesies about future events, this time also specifying even the name of the person, so that there is no ambiguity. I do not know when this part was written and whether it was written before or after Eliakim's rise to becoming the palace administrator and Shebna's degradation to scribe. But everything that happened was part of God's plan. 
Hardly anyone could be trusted with the responsibility of taking care of God's people—"fathering Jerusalem" in verse 21. Eliakim would turn out to be gaining glory for himself eventually, forgetting Who it was Who gave him the position of palace administrator in the first place. 
God set everything in place, he degraded Shebna, so that Eliakim could rise. But Eliakim forgot about God. How often do we forget about what God has done for us? Or do we even see what God has done for us to even be at the position we are right now? 
I know that I am in the Netherlands not by coincidence, but purely by God's work. Out of all of my father's siblings, he is the only who managed to go and stay in the Netherlands. My mother and her sister are the only two who managed to stay in the Netherlands as well. 
My wife has a similar story. Her mother was the first one to emigrate to Suriname, but invited her brothers to come over as well. Each one of them had personal reasons for going back to Hong Kong, either feeling homesick or because their spouses were. 
It is a gift of God if one can find his place in the world, a place where he can make a living, find a place to live, and sometimes find a spouse and feel home as well. Even fewer of those manage to speak the language. We do not realize what we have. 
One could define this as luck, for example to be lucky not to be born in Africa or India where chances are very low to finish high school or to even get to high school. In other words, luck is defined as the amount of [welfare #todo/opzoeken ], which is again expressed in monetary or educational value. But Jesus chose disciples who had neither money, education nor status, but whose hearts were on the right place. 
So redefining luck, one is lucky when one is born into God-fearing (two-parent) family and community. That is most important criterium for defining luck.
