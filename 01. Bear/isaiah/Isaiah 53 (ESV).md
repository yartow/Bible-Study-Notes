# Isaiah 53 (ESV) 
*1 Who has believed what he has heard from us?*
*And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?*

In the previous chapter we read that the arm of the Lord has been revealed to Israel's enemies. Of course this means it has been revealed to Israel itself as well. God revealed His bare arm to defeat the Assyrians and everyone who came next and made sure they took care of His children. The Jews had seen that, I assume, and if not they must have read about it through the books of Kings, Chronicles, Isaiah and later on Ezra and Nehemiah. 
But the question here in verse 1 is about *who* has heard and believed this message from God? I do not know about the believed part, but most certainly the Jews had heard about it. The second line in the first verse confirms that this verse is referring to the Jews. 
The first question in this verse is also a rhetorical question, where the answer is that no one has believed it, at least not most of the Jews. 

*2 For he grew up before him like a young plant,*
*and like a root out of dry ground;*
*he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,*
*and no beauty that we should desire him.*

Then comes a description of what Jesus was like. It does not necessarily mean that Jesus was ugly. A root out of dry ground is not nice to see, but it could also be the "soil" from which Jesus grew up, Galilee and a time of spiritual drought—the time where legalism was thriving through the Pharisees—was dry. The fact that it is written that Jesus had "no beauty that we should desire him" does not mean that He did not have beauty, it was merely not that much that he would be desired. He could have looked like a normal person, but not handsome enough to be a superstar or model. 
The word *"that"* probably is *hina* #todo/opzoeken in Greece. 

*3 He was despised and rejected by men,*
*a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief;*

In verse 2 it is about Jesus growing up and in verse 5 about Him dying on the cross. It is not certain whether verses 3 and 4 are about His adolescence or His adulthood or the very last years of His life on Earth. I will leave in the middle what the exact answer is, also because I do not know myself. But what I do find remarkable is that it could be applied to all the years of His life. 
I can imagine that Jesus was despised and rejected, bullied so to speak, because He was a man of sorrows and always grieving. Surely, Jesus attended weddings and He could have fun at times, but it does not mean that during a walk along the streets He was grieving when looking at all the poverty, both material and spiritual. I believe He was even grieving when He was not looking at them with His eyes, but in His prayer time. I also believe that a big part of His prayers went to the ones He was grieving about. It is not for nothing that Jesus commands us to do six things in Matthew 25 and that He says that those who take care of their fellowmen will be His brothers. 
It is hard to imagine a person walking along the streets, even sadder than the beggars living on the streets, and then offering them their help. Whenever we see Jesus in a movie, we see a close-up of a friendly and slightly smiling face, bending down to stretch out His hand to a beggar on the floor, to help him up or to heal him. But can you imagine a Jesus-like figure crying and grieving and then doing the same, stretching out his hand etc.? 
A grieving person, like a man who has just lost his life partner of 40 years, is not one from whom you can expect to give money to a beggar on the streets. He is excused when he walks right past him. We probably cannot imagine because we have never seen anything like that, because that kind of behavior might be the penultimate example of self-sacrifice–out of a confidence so high in God that He will take of all of your needs, your material as well as your emotional ones, you are willing to look *over* your grievance and look *at* the grievance of others as more important than your own. Note that this is not the same as being codependent, for in codependency one thinks his needs actually *are* worth less than others' needs. 
The ultimate example of self-sacrifice of course is in the sacrifice of your own body, which Jesus Christ did for us on the cross. 

*and as one from whom men hide their faces*
*he was despised, and we esteemed him not.*

So I can imagine that Jesus was what some what could call—and with all due respect to Jesus Christ—an overly emotional person. I would not say high sensitive, because that bears some negative connotations such as a high sensitivity to sound and light, and uncomfortableness in crowds, which Jesus did not have, nor did Jesus have any negative character traits to begin with. But he could be regarded as one whose grief could be read on His face at many times. Jesus would be at peace, but He would be carrying the load for 33 years long, knowing that He would die on the cross—which is grief enough already—but also knowing and feeling all of the grief and pain of everyone in the whole world in the past and future. Now, I do not know if God the Father allowed Jesus to feel so much grief for such a long period, but most certainly Jesus felt more than we did, as He even cried when entering the city of Jerusalem in the last year of His life and ministry. 
But here it says that Jesus was One "from whom men hide their faces". Why would anyone hide his face from Jesus? Only if one is ashamed of something, right? Jesus perhaps had these penetrating eyes, in a good sense, which caused you to know you are guilty of your sins. Some, of course, were so stubborn that they were convinced they were sin-less or they were like the present-day Antifa, #todo/opzoeken goedpraten 
presenting their unethical actions as good to get rid of a man who incites hatred (I am referring to the actions of the Antifa against Trump) and blasphemy (I am referring to the actions of the Pharisees against Jesus). 
But they too, the scribes and the Pharisees, hid their faces from Jesus. My contention is that they could not spend too much time with them and always were in a group, because even as a group they could defeat Him on any theological manner, and one on one they would most definitely lose and might even be convinced of the truth. Jesus might even bring up their sins *despite* their hardened hearts, the stubbornness and the lack of conviction, but Jesus, through the Holy Spirit, can convict people—unless a person avoids Jesus. 
That is why Jesus was despised. Merely because the people who saw Him were confronted with their own sin and there was nothing they could say or do against it, besides repent. 

*4 Surely he has borne our griefs*
*and carried our sorrows;*
*yet we esteemed him stricken,*
*smitten by God, and afflicted.*

The worst thing, however, or at one of the worst things is that we esteemed Him stricken by God, smitten, or in other words, dirty as if He were contagious, just like everyone avoids a mongoloid child (i.e. a person with Down syndrome) or an idiot or an autist. Besides that, and that is what this verse is talking about, we think God punished Him for this, because of His own sins!
But the fact of the matter is that Jesus feels this way because of us. It would be like someone having an utterly piercing #todo/opzoeken doordringende body odor which makes one's face cringe as soon as you smell it. And then this unknowing person meets this odorful #todo/opzoeken  person and his face twists and he holds his breath. 
The odorful person will start to think what is wrong with that person. "Why is he pulling funny faces? It is a shame, how one can be born like that." But he does not realize that is *only* and *because* of him that he acts this way. 
The same goes for Jesus. Jesus has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows, spiritually, but most likely mentally and perhaps physically as well, since the mind influences the body. They avoid Him, but they do not know that it is exactly because of themselves that Jesus is cringing and hurting on the inside. 
And the more we avoid Him, and in effect avoid to confront our sins, the more sinful we are which in effect hurts Him more. 

*5 But he was pierced for our transgressions;*
*he was crushed for our iniquities;*
*upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,*
*and with his wounds we are healed.*

How much worse can it get? In the end, it was not even enough for Jesus to bear our griefs and mentally suffer for it, He had to suffer for it physically as well. While He has perhaps suffered mentally and spiritually either from birth or from a certain age at which He could grasp all this, when highly gifted (hoog IQ #todo/opzoeken ) this would be about 30 years. Unfortunately, He had to suffer physically for a long period as well. It was "only" a day, but it was a long day, starting in the morning, going through all kinds of torture: 
* Mental torture and insults, abandonment and disappointment by even His closest friends and disciples; Perhaps emotional torture is part of the mental one. Jesus was constantly ridiculed by the ones for whom He died, and made out to be a criminal. He saw with His own eyes how the people chose Barabbas over Him. What sadness must have gone through His heart? 
* Spiritual torture by the feeling of not only grief, but also all the sin of the past and future world, and the guilt that accompanies it, with eventually an abandonment at the end by His own Father; 
* Physical torture by flogging, the carrying of His cross and the hanging on the cross. I do not know if it was normal to be flogged before being put on the cross, but I have read that it could take a person three days to die on a cross, and that they were kept alive by letting them drink—while on the cross—vinegar which has anesthetic properties, so that the punished would hold out longer and suffer for a longer duration.

*6 All we like sheep have gone astray;*
*we have turned—every one—to his own way;*
*and the Lord has laid on him*
*the iniquity of us all.* 

#todo/opzoeken  difference between  iniquity, sin, transgression

We are like sheep, but Jesus is like a sheep as well. However, the difference is that we all ran away, out of fear, and only one sheep stayed, consciously, *despite* His fear, but out of obedience for God and love for us. And also because it was the *only* way to save us. 
Just like many movies, such as *Home Run* (about Celebrate Recovery) and *Warrior* (with Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy) two brothers were abused, but as soon as one left home, the other had to #todo/opzoeken incasseren
take all the abuse on himself. 
And so we all are like sheep and *all of us*—not even one is righteous (cf. Romans 3:23 #todo/opzoeken ) —fled and left the only sheep behind Who could and did take all the sin of us upon Himself. 

*7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,*
*yet he opened not his mouth;*
*like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,*
*and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,*
*so he opened not his mouth.*

Any sheep could have been murdered or slaughtered, but only one could do this without opening his mouth. Has anyone ever seen a lamb led to the slaughter, knowing that he is going to be slaughtered, and still stay silent even during the slaughter? 
Jesus is like this lamb. He knew what was going to happen, probably from the beginning of His life, He knew that all of His life and ministry would culminate in this point and though He has, gently I must say, asked God to remove this cup from Him, perhaps the death, perhaps the method of dying or the (emotionxal) pain that would be inflicted on Him, God did not allow and He willingly underwent the whole process from 3 AM in the morning until 3 PM #todo/opzoeken  in the afternoon. 
He could have said, "Let's get it over with, just nail Me on the cross" and He might have skipped out on all the beatings, the spitting and the insults and accusations of blasphemy and lies, the walking between different courts with an injured body, and perhaps even the flogging. I can imagine the Jews would want Him to be crucified as soon as possible and would even be willing to skip the flogging. 
But Jesus did not. He allowed all of this to happen to His body, without even reacting on all the accusations. He could defeat them in any debate on any subject, with any amount of proof or witnesses perhaps. He would see right through their lies and perhaps with pure logic while only using the Old Testament part of the Bible that was available at that time (i.e. until the Book of Zechariah, for Malachi was not in the official canon at that time #todo/opzoeken  why not?). He could have proven them wrong, sinful, unrighteous, not in the position to be a leader or to incriminate anyone, let alone Jesus Himself, Who has not a smudge on His record, but is Himself "without stain, wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless" (cf. Ephesians 3:25-26). 
He did not do so. How much more could Jesus have done which would be even within the drinking of this cup? Too much to write and most definitely too much for me to write down here, but I can imagine He could outspeak #todo/opzoeken  Herod, Pilate, and the crowd to release Him instead of Barabbas. He could also shut the criminal next to Him on the cross by convicting him of his sins or simply by telling him just one of his hidden sins and in this way show him that He is God. Jesus could probably even have done while staying within the boundaries of sin. But still, Jesus chose not to and chose to suffer on the cross, paying the full price and perhaps even more. 
I am not sure if Jesus did all of the above I mentioned, by getting some retribution and #todo/opzoeken incasseren somewhat less pain by using His smarts, whether His death on the cross would still be sufficient. Eventually all the sins of the world would come upon Him anyway in the moment of His death. All of the punishment suffered before that would only increase His pain and agony. However, this would perhaps quicken the death as well. Jesus probably needed to suffer an amount of pain, both physically and mentally (and emotionally, spiritually etc.). It would either be on the cross or partially during the way *to* the cross and the rest *on* the cross. 

*8 By oppression and judgment he was taken away;*
*and as for his generation, who considered*
*that he was cut off out of the land of the living,*
*stricken for the transgression of my people?*

The first statement is true. Nothing can be said against that. Even the Jews who do not consider Jesus to be the Messiah, surely they would say that the first part of verse 8 is embodied by the events surrounding Good Friday and the morning of Jesus' death. 
But who is Jesus' generation? The who-question that follows is a rhetorical question, but I would not answer "none" of that, for Maria from Magdalene seems to have known that Jesus would die. She actually listened to what Jesus said. Would she have understood that Jesus said he would die for the sins of the world as well? I would say so. In any case, the number would not be bigger than a handful, for even His very own disciples did not understand this until He rose again. 

#todo/opzoeken  books of the Bible in chronological order

*9 And they made his grave with the wicked*
*and with a rich man in his death,*
*although he had done no violence,*
*and there was no deceit in his mouth.*

Jesus was put to death with criminals literally beside Him. 
* He was chosen to die instead of Barabbas. 
* From the movies at least, it feels like Pilate was ready to release Jesus even if it were not Easter and one criminal could be set free on that day. But still, the Jews (perhaps incited by the Pharisees) wanted Jesus dead. 
* Then after His flogging, Pilate wanted to release Him but the Jews still wanted Him dead. 
It seems like the Jews had many chances to repent from their wrong decisions, although after the flogging, which in the movies seems like more than the 40 minus one strokes allowed, Jesus would probably have died anyway from blood loss or infections. 
It seems like the Jews actually thought He was a criminal, although they were aroused by the Pharisees and their own feelings of insecurity (hence Jesus' (first? #todo/opzoeken ) words, "Forgive them, Father, for they do not know what they do"—although he could be speaking of the Romans, who actually had no idea who Jesus was (except for the centurion)). But no matter what they thought or felt, they actually *treated* Him as such and most likely even worse. 
I do not know if it was custom for people to yell at a hanged or crucified people. God's intention has always been that days like these (days where a person was to be killed) should be a day of mourning, for one of their own, an Israelite, had strayed off the right path and turned his back on God. Just like one would mourn when a fellow Israelite decides not to follow God anymore. Even though he did nothing "criminal", it is still a loss worth mourning over. 

*10 Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him;*
*he has put him to grief;*
*when his soul makes an offering for guilt,*
*he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days;*
*the will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.*

Even though the Israelites did not even know why they killed Jesus or at least rooted for it—some did it out of jealousy, such as the Pharisees and the scribes, some out of fear for them, perhaps some were even paid by them and some simply followed the crowd—God the Father still wanted Jesus to not only die, but to be crushed. Jesus had to grief as well. It was all part of the package. 
As mentioned above, a certain amount of suffering was needed for Jesus to fulfill His purpose. Merely physical suffering would not be enough, and He was not allowed to take an anesthetic (the wine at the cross, up until the very end though when He did take it, perhaps that was because the suffering was sufficient #biblestudy/questions #todo/opzoeken ).
So crushing was the first part, grieving the second. Not only was Jesus to be crushed emotionally, He had to grieve for the people as well. Jesus was very clear on why He had to die. It was not out of sheer duty to His Father, but He knew that if He did not die, the Israelites and the whole world would then end up in hell. Jesus of course grieved that part and was for this reason as well willing to give up His own life. 
But grieve hurts. Grievance usually happens *after* an event has happened, e.g. after someone has died, or perhaps even gets sick. But the grievance for a sick person is different than for a dead person, because for the sick person there is still hope. Jesus perhaps could see or imagine the future and grieve about all those lost souls, which is not practically but literally everyone, even those who had faith such as the ones mentioned in Hebrews 11—for faith is only applicable when there is Someone in Whom you could have it. But faith is of no use when Jesus had not died. For it says in Scripture, in Romans 3:24 (NIV)
> ... all have been justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that came by Jesus Christ.  
And so all of this is of no use is Jesus Christ did not redeem us in His death first. There would be no grace or justification, and this righteousness (in verse 22) would not be given because faith in Jesus Christ would be meaningless. 
We are not done yet—or let me say, Jesus was not done yet. Not only did He have to grieve for us, He had to grieve Himself, as if all of our mistakes were His'! Like a person who repents from his mistakes, so Jesus had to repent from our mistakes, which is only possible if He felt the guilt as a consequence of our sins. This is written on the next line of this verse. 

In the line after that we see that the Servant, Jesus, will see His offspring. This means that He will not be alive again. The soul was offered, so Jesus must have died, but He rose again. I do not understand what "prolong" means here, because Jesus was not dependent on sleep or daylight after His resurrection. #biblestudy/questions
MacSBNnkjv writes that this does not indicate longer days, but rather longer life. In fact it writes that Jesus will live and reign forever. However, I would say that Jesus already had eternal life before His resurrection. 
But for sure God's will would be done through Jesus' hand. In the hands of others, even of prophets sometimes, it failed or was not carried out fully, in time or in the right manner. But in Jesus' hands it was carried out perfectly.

*11 Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied;*
*by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,*
*make many to be accounted righteous,*
*and he shall bear their iniquities.*

This verse describes perfectly what Jesus has done for us. Through His death and the pain therein He has borne our iniquities and made many to be *accounted* righteous. Note that Isaiah does not use a single word too little or too many. We have not been made righteous, but accounted righteous. Our value is still in the negative, due to our sins, but on paper, due to Jesus' payment, we have gone to at least neutral. 
It is a shame that Jesus had to look out of the anguish of His soul. There was no other way for Jesus to be satisfied. Jesus' longing was for us to be saved. 
Now a question comes to mind. How did Jesus use His knowledge to make us to be accounted righteous? I think the answer is as follows. Jesus died for our sins and paid a huge price for it. But whenever someone buys something, he needs to say what he wants to buy. So in order for Jesus to pay off our debts He had to know which debts to pay for, which is all of them for every person of course, but still, He had to know every single sin of us. 
It is only fair that the person who is willing to forgive you for your sin and pay for your crimes at least know what sin you have committed. More than fair and necessary it is for him to know how much it costs, otherwise he does not know how much to pay. So in other words, Jesus knows each sin of us (because He is God) and how much it costs, because He felt the pain for each of these sins.  #church/material
Perhaps He even felt more than that, because with a lot of sins one does not hurt only the other, but himself and God as well. If one cuts himself for example, and Jesus paid for this sin, then Jesus would to "erase" the pain felt by these three persons. He would then feel the pain of these three persons caused by this cut. On the other hand, I am not really sure of this theory, because the pain has already been felt by all three persons. 
So what happens if Person A beats Person B. Person B is hurt and A can repay for it by feeling the pain caused to B. So in the case of cutting, Person A is hurting his parents and God, aside from himself, so retribution could occur by letter A feel God's and his parents' pain. That would then *most probably, but only deductively and speculatively* be the pain Jesus felt. 
But regardless of the amount of feelings, it starts with knowledge. 

Note that the verse says "many" and not "all", for not everyone is saved. 
Note as well that MacSBNnkjv writes that *knowledge* refers not to knowing how much pain was inflicted and how this felt, but to how this problem could be solved. Perhaps it was more than "simply" dying on the cross, but some or a lot of knowledge was necessary (perhaps in the phases after death). If that were the case, I still find it strange that that line starts with "by" then. For it says "by" His knowledge and not "through" His knowledge. 

*12 Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many,*
*and he shall divide the spoil with the strong,*
*because he poured out his soul to death*
*and was numbered with the transgressors;*
*yet he bore the sin of many,*
*and makes intercession for the transgressors.*

The many, as mentioned before, is not all of the people and refers only to those who are saved by Jesus Christ. Is Jesus' portion then divided with ours? I would not say so. Jesus owns everything, how then can He have but a portion? Also, what does the spoil here refer to? The spoil is usually that what is stolen from the enemy, but what could possible be stolen from the enemy? The only thing that the enemy has in possession are the souls of the people not following God. These cannot possible be returned to God, because they made their own choice. 
However, the enemy has in possession also the souls of the people who *are* following God, but because they have sinned, their souls are now owned by Satan. The interpretation of this verse becomes a bit complex then. Jesus saves the many; within the many there are "the strong". He also steals back that what was stolen from the many, that is their souls. He cannot, unfortunately, take back the souls stolen from the non-many. Then, Jesus divides the spoil, that is the souls, with the strong. 
Does that mean then that the strong, perhaps people of more spiritual maturity, get multiple souls? Or perhaps the spoil is not the souls but talents. In that case these *could* be obtained from the non-many and it would then make sense that these are divided among the strong, who would then be able to use these in heaven. The people who passed away before reaching spiritual maturity would then have less talents and only these that they obtained during their life on Earth, to use in heaven, which for some is still quite a lot. 
A question remains than whether the talents of the many would be taken and divided as well. #biblestudy/questions

Next, the word "yet" makes it hard to exegete this verse. If it were "because", it becomes a lot easier because then the meaning would be "Jesus gets to divide the spoil *because* He is the One Who died and did the work." In this case the writers of the ESV translation have chosen the word "yet" (while in the KJV translation we read the word "and"). The meaning becomes: "Despite the fact that Jesus knew He would be numbered with the transgressors—a lot of people would not recognize Him as a king or hero or someone who sacrificed himself for others, not even after Jesus had risen and still not 2000 years later, but rather as someone who deserved this punishment—He still chose to bear the sin of the many. 
Note that the last line only says that Jesus bore the sins of the many, i.e. those who are saved through faith. Jesus did not pay for those who did not want to follow Him. Of course we must assume then that God already knew who in the past, present and future would ever give their life to God (and Jesus) and put only this amount of punishment on Jesus. This was an efficient yet sufficient punishment. Why would Jesus need to suffer more? 
It does impact how we evangelize to people though when we say: "Jesus died for your sins too." We do not know whether Jesus died for that person; We can only say this in hindsight and only if we ever find out whether a person comes to Christ. However, it is hard to say: "Jesus might have died for you as well." It would be more acceptable and honest to say: "Jesus died for everyone who is willing to take Him as their Savior and King." #biblestudy/questions
