# Isaiah 29
**Woe to David’s City**
*1 Woe to you, Ariel, Ariel,*
*the city where David settled!*
*Add year to year*
*and let your cycle of festivals go on.*
*2 Yet I will besiege Ariel;*
*she will mourn and lament,*
*she will be to me like an altar hearth.*
*3 I will encamp against you on all sides;*
*I will encircle you with towers*
*and set up my siege works against you.*

The city where God was worshipped, that God—so to speak—handpicked out of all cities out of all countries, where He wished to be worshipped, on this specific mountain—this city God would destroy Himself. 
No matter whether God handpicked it or created it, He is going to destroy it. For the sake of the people.
As mentioned in the previous chapter, God did this for a greater purpose, to save the people. God gave up on His city, so He could save the lives of His people.
It was a pain to His heart, to lose both his city and His people to foreign nations, His former children.

God had to work against His own children. This is the most desperate thing—although this word is not fitting for God—a human father could do. A man would only do this if his love for them is great enough, as well as his love for righteousness. God’s love for both is greater than any man’s love, and on top of that, He *is* love and He *is* righteousness Himself! He is the *definition* of both. 
But God is not desperate. He has another option: He could destroy body and soul, He could destroy this world; He could continue with other some people from this world and pick any person like Abraham or Noah to start a new people and a new covenant with. Painful as that would be, but much more efficient, perhaps even more efficient, He chooses not to, because He is a God of His Word. 
God said that He would be a faithful God if the people were faithful to Him. Even if He decided to destroy this world, He would have been faithful to His Word, because it is the Israelites who did not keep their end of the deal. Not out of duty, but out of love for His people, He decides to give them a second chance, and third one, and so on. 
God is a patient God and He has been with you and me as well. How many chances has He given You already? I know He’s given me countless chances, more than I can remember, for every day He has enough reason to give up on me: sinful thoughts, sinful acts, no respect for others, no respect for my own parents or my wife. I have figuratively speaking already broken all of the Ten Commandments, and literaly I am nearly at ten. 
Three chances come to mind specifically when I look at my past. 
**Chance 1.** When I was eight years old I once had such a bad mood. On Sundays I was all into watching cartoons as soon as woke up. 
On a given time my mom called me because we had to go to Sunday school. Usually I was quite willingly, but this specific Sunday I was very reluctant. [… continuation of story, of what happened during Sunday school class…]
Things went bad and when the teacher said, “but Jesus loves you”, I told her: “I don’t care if He loves me.” 
[… after that, I stopped going to Sunday school, because my mom didn’t want to force me…]
[… continuation of how this same teacher happened to end up at my new school. I transferred, and she transferred as well. And because of her I got to know God better.]

My spiritual education, so to speak, ended as soon as I went to high school. I kept praying every night and before every meal. 

**Chance 2.** At age 15 there was a coffee night for which I received an invitation. 
I promised I would give my whole life to Jesus. 

Later on, it turned out I hadn’t. God had to show me He was in control. 
I couldn’t do maths anymore, later on even my piano skills disappeared. 

**Chance 3.** In university I was as free as a bird. No one to control me. I went the wrong way again. 
Until I met Sandra, who brought me back. 

*4 Brought low, you will speak from the ground;*
*your speech will mumble out of the dust.*
*Your voice will come ghostlike from the earth;*
*out of the dust your speech will whisper.*
*5 But your many enemies will become like fine dust,*
*the ruthless hordes like blown chaff.*

The Jews will be brought low. In our time they have already been brought low, with voices so small that nobody cared to listen for them. The fate of the Jews in WWII was decidedly so, because so few people were willing to stand up for them. 
Looking back the Assyrian war, Israel had long been in a position where they were not heard anymore. Their allies were only self-centered and could not even withstand the Assyrians invasion on their own, let alone help Israel. 
Israel itself had wasted hundreds of years worth of worship to the Lord, by worshipping other gods, wasting its money on gods and temples, not on the people, to train them for war and worship of God. But Israel, through its bad kings, wasted these years and tested Gods patience. They did not have any credits with God or any of the other gods, since all of their idolatry and pagan worship was for gods made by man, or in other words, not the real God.

Christians and Jews in these days have been laid low as well. Not only due to attacks from the Left, but also because of their own haughty behavior. More secular Jews exist now that orthodox ones, but the same thing is happening in Christianity, which is not possible. 
A Jew is and stays a child of God, whether or not he chooses to follow God, and his progeny will someday stop being Jewish, when it is mixed up enough with Gentiles.
#todo/opzoeken  difference between heathen, pagan, Gentile
A Christian, however, is born a Gentile and not a child of God and he can choose to become one—provided God elected this person as eligible to become Christian. A person who decides to live a secular and worldly life, however, is not a real Christian and as such, does not count toward the number of Christians. 
The same thing that happened in Judah and Jerusalem is happening in the West today. The number of God-fearing Jews in Jerusalem was so small, and the majority was not worshipping God anymore. The number of orthodox Jews and (real) Christians is so small that the majority of (orthodox and secular) Jews and Christians altogether is not worshipping God anymore.
God will punish, He will plow, to once again sow His seed in our hearts to grow new fruit. 
The voices of Christians will be mumbled, and already are—for how many people know the truth of the Six-Day Creation in Genesis? Even within God-fearing Christians this voice has been muffled away, let alone in the secular environments.
The stories of Israel and the present day—though last century—miracles that God performed in the conquest for Israel in the Six-Day War in 1966 are done away with coincidence and are just simple historical facts, while very few know that had always been impossible to conquer Easter Jerusalem. 
We too—as Christian and orthodox Jews—have failed, we are too small to save the United States and the rest of the West and we will be unheard of, the West will be destroyed slightly, but the attackers—analogous to the Assyrians—will be destroyed completely, though they are in the West as well.

*Suddenly, in an instant,*
*6 the Lord Almighty will come*
*with thunder and earthquake and great noise,*
*with windstorm and tempest and flames of a devouring fire.*
*7 Then the hordes of all the nations that fight against Ariel,*
*that attack her and her fortress and besiege her,*
*will be as it is with a dream,*
*with a vision in the night—*
*8 as when a hungry person dreams of eating,*
*but awakens hungry still;*
*as when a thirsty person dreams of drinking,*
*but awakens faint and thirsty still.*
*So will it be with the hordes of all the nations*
*that fight against Mount Zion.*

Isaiah uses a fair amount of hyperboles and paraboles (analogies? #todo/opzoeken ) in his description of the people and their behavior. The bed sheets being too short is one of my favorite and—to me—most striking ones, but this one comes at a good second place.
Usually when we dream, we realize it has all been but a—usually—bad dream. But in this case, it is real. The hungry person is still hungry and thirsty person is still thirsty. That is their curse, their worst nightmares will come true and even when it has come true and when they are in the midst of it, they will still have these nightmares, so even in the night, in their sleep, they will not get rest. That is what they get for fighting against the city of the Lord. 

Very often the the apple one’s eye is what triggers people most. What I mean by this is that for example a man’s family can be hurt or killed, until only one person is left, the apple of their eye, his daughter, for example, and nothing would happen, except for a great deal of sadness and mourning. But if this last person is killed as well, then this man will become enraged and avenge his family.
This situation can be found in the movie *The Foreigner* with Jackie Chan in it, who depicts the man in my description above. 
As for the analogy with Israel, all of Israel had been corrupted already, either by destruction by the Assyrians or the Israelites themselves, who brought foreign idols into their country. But Jerusalem, the apple of God’s eye, was protected. 
The Assyrian king Sennacherib attacked all of Israel and received—as far as I know—no punishment it, or perhaps just not yet. But when he attacked Jerusalem he received his punishment the day after! According to Josephus by the way, this was as a cause of the plague, but that would not explain how so many people, about 400.000, died in one night. I have hardly ever heard of any disease that could establish this kind of efficacy.
Why did God punish the Assyrians so heavily and so immediately? Because Jerusalem, also known as Ariel, is the apple of God’s eye, it is God’s favorite city within His favorite country, belonging to His favorite people. That is the first reason. 

This city, that has brought forth so much good, wisdom and perhaps technology, knowledge on trade and other economic methods, but mostly moral standards and goodness to the rest of the world, was attacked. This is the second reason—in my analysis—of why God favored Jerusalem. 
All of Israel is important, but if the capital is taken, in most case the whole country is taken. Why is this country important? Because these people provide the proof of God’s hand in the creation of this world and in every part of history. 
The people, the Jews in the South and the Israelites in the North, are living proof of God. They were healthier and less prone to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), had better results in harvesting and in academic performance. A whole list of achievements can even be found in the Israel of today and even Wikipedia lists these. Jews (and Israelites) comprise a disproportionate majority of the Nobel Prize winners, chess masters and Ivy League university students. 
God placed Israel in the middle of the trading world, on the intersection of the most important trading routes between the continents of Africa, Europe and the Middle-East, located even on the trading route to Asia, i.e. the Silk Route.

He put Israel in the middle of these routes so they could spread all of the goodness that God had given to the world. If this country was destroyed, God would have lost this medium of spreading this knowledge.
Now God can spread His knowledge in any way He seems fit and He is able to. At this time He chose to do it in this way. A hundred years later He chose not to spread His Word in such a central way, except through Daniel and Esther who not coincidentally had important roles in the kingdoms of Babylon and Persia, and perhaps in an equally important but less broadcasted—and known—way through Ezra and Nehemiah, and later on Zerubbabel #todo/opzoeken who did get the king's affection and permission and financial support to rebuild the walls or Jerusalem and its temple.
Another hundred years later God decided to let the Jews back to Israel but this time without showing the miracles, and in my guess, a small blessing of the people. They were after all colonized by the Romans and under the kingdom of Herod, an Edomite, their familial enemy!
And yet another four hundred years later God elected some Israelites to spread the Gospel to the foreigners who could from then on spread the Good News and the Law of God. #church/material

*9 Be stunned and amazed,*
*blind yourselves and be sightless;*
*be drunk, but not from wine,*
*stagger, but not from beer.*
*10 The Lord has brought over you a deep sleep:*
*He has sealed your eyes (the prophets);*
*he has covered your heads (the seers).*
*11 For you this whole vision is nothing but words sealed in a scroll. And if you give the scroll to someone who can read, and say, “Read this, please,” they will answer, “::I can’t::; it is sealed.” 12 Or if you give the scroll to someone who cannot read, and say, “Read this, please,” they will answer, “I don’t know how to read.”*

Is God now speaking or is it Isaiah? Is this person speaking to the Jews? And is this vision the whole of this chapter and the previous ones until this verse?
What God is trying to say is that the Jews are blinded and staggering, though not from alcohol but from their own stupidity. Then are undeserving of receiving this prophecy from Isaiah and most likely this book was not published and spread widely even after it was written. Isaiah could have kept it as proof and shown only the people he trusted to show that he already received this message from God, this prophecy of what was going to happen to Israel and her surrounding people. 
Even if they read it, the will not understand it. Even now, now it has been translated to English and with the help of commentaries, it still does not mean a lot to many. Most Christians I know, if ever reading the Bible, skip this book of Isaiah, because it is too difficult or boring. In that sense they are blinded, they do not see the powers and the miracles of God. It is neither difficult nor boring, but that is because they do not see the truth, which God has hidden from them. 
In my previous devotionals I have tried to explain what Isaiah means for the West, and more specifically for the United States. But if someone from Europe were to read this in, say, the Middle Ages, or a person from China would have read this a few hundred years ago, would this then have any relevance for those people? Yes, it would. 
The Bible is a book of relevance for all people of all ages, anywhere in the world, because it is a living book. It is written in such a way that many parts, if not all, are applicable for each person’s life, and God will show each person a specific phrase or paragraph on a specific time, intended for this person’s life and through which he can know and see God a little more.
So the sealing would apply for those who keep the book shut. This is for those people who can read, but not even break the seal, because—as we will see in Revelations—breaking the seal will have consequences, and who is up for that? 
The second group of people who cannot read are perhaps the people who have at least tried to read but come to the conclusion that they do not understand what is in it. Blinded by God, who blinded them because they refused to listen to Him in the first place. And if they are not willing to to know the truth, and only want to know their own truth, God will give them over to their own will, which is their own truth. Hence we see that atheists are ever resistant in hearing the truth. And even truths as obvious as the lie of evolution apes the man, where one bone attributes to the "discovery" of a new species, without any further proof, are accepted as truth and even scientific facts.
They are willing to redefine science for the sake of the truth in their minds.

*13 The Lord says:*
::*“These people come near to me with their mouth*::
::*and honor me with their lips,*::
::*but their hearts are far from me.*::
::*Their worship of me*::
::*is based on merely human rules they have been taught.*::
*14 Therefore once more I will astound these people*
*with wonder upon wonder;*
*the wisdom of the wise will perish,*
*the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish. ”*
*15 Woe to those who go to great depths*
*to hide their plans from the Lord,*
*who do their work in darkness and think,*
*“Who sees us? Who will know?”*

The worship of people who do not know God is not authentic. So many presidents, unfortunately including Trump—who is doing some very good things, such as defunding Planned Parenthood and moving the embassy from Tel Aviv back to Jerusalem—say that they are Christian, they call for prayer on television and they say *God bless America*. All the while I believe they are not sincerely praying or praying at all, they do not go to church, like Obama—although he claimed he had a minister come over at Camp David—and they do not believe in God, a god, much less in His blessings, if even they know what a blessing is. 
Not only are their hearts and words fake, they are also blind to what is real. For non-Christian were to see the real love of Christians, they would not be attacking Christians, but rather be jealous of them and wanting to have that as well and start their strive to obtain this. That would have been a good thing. But instead their lust is like a blinding rage that lets them see only what they think is good. 
No matter how smart they are or wise, they make the most foolish decisions when they are led by their own feelings and personal views. 

*16 You turn things upside down,*
*as if the potter were thought to be like the clay!*
*Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it,*
*“You did not make me”?*
*Can the pot say to the potter,*
*“You know nothing”?*

They are blinded and do not see Your love and Your Greatness, O Lord. What can be done to make them realize Your existence?
You have said it. You will need to do miracles, wonders upon wonders to open their eyes. But Your miracles will be of such great magnitude that it will turn their world upside down. That is what is meant with the example of the potter. It is as if the potter becomes clay. It is unimaginable that You would ever become clay, but You have. The people You created, You have become like them. Such a great wonder that is, that it has turned the world upside down. It has split time in two, before and after Christ; it has split people in two, those who are saved and those who are not.
But that is the ultimate wonder You have done. Even before that, You have shown Your miraculous work through the conquest of the Assyrians. How have they become so strong? It is all through Your work. How have they been so easily defeated? It is all through Your work. 

*17 In a very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field*
*and the fertile field seem like a forest?*
*18 In that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll,*
*and out of gloom and darkness*
*the eyes of the blind will see.*
*19 Once more the humble will rejoice in the Lord;*
*the needy will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.*
*20 The ruthless will vanish,*
*the mockers will disappear,*
*and all who have an eye for evil will be cut down—*
*21 those who with a word make someone out to be guilty,*
*who ensnare the defender in court*
*and with false testimony deprive the innocent of justice.*

It is also impossible to imagine that all evil will be removed from this world. I haven often tried to imagine what heaven would look like, but everytime I do that, I am imagining that I am remember something from my previous life on Earth, which is not (always) possible, because it would mean I remember sin. 
Would a drug addict who ended up in heaven be able to remember his pain or his feelings when using drugs? I do not know how it is possible to remember sin without pain, for heaven is without sin and pain. 
As impossible as that is, even more impossible than the cutting down of the (forests of) Lebanon in a *short* time, with its huge mammoth trees—which of course is easily done with an nuclear bomb nowadays, but even with bulldozers and trucks it would be fairly impossible—or turning a field into a forest—which even today is still impossible, because trees do not grow that fast, and it is—I would say—impossible to plant a 100 meters' tall tree, let alone thousands of them *in a short time*.
But that is exactly what will happen. Not only will the deaf hear and the blind see, they will hear and see the Word of the Lord! The bad people will disappear!
Another one of those things that I have not been able to imagine is a city without criminality or a country without evil people, or people longing to do evil. 

*22 Therefore this is what the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, says to the descendants of Jacob:*
*“No longer will Jacob be ashamed;*
*no longer will their faces grow pale.*
::*23 When they see among them their children,*::
::*the work of my hands,*::
::*they will keep my name holy;*::
::*they will acknowledge the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob,*::
::*and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.*:: #biblestudy/memorization/todo
*24 Those who are wayward in spirit will gain understanding;*
*those who complain will accept instruction.”*

Can you imagine that the most wayward people will understand God and *accept* instruction? I know people who are doing everything against the Ten Commandments. Almost everyone in the Netherlands is doing that—for that matter, so it is not hard to find anyone like that. But these people are so reluctant to and careless about God. I would even say they do not care about their fellowmen. 
Some people, who are atheists or agnostics, do what they do, or stand for something like abortion, because they truly believe it will help out people. They do not see the value of life inside the womb as comparable with the life outside of it, or that of the mother. But that is a *lack of insight*. In a sense, that is not their fault. Their principles are still focused on what is best for mankind, or for this world, if in their belief man is only part of this world and can be sacrificed for the sake of it. 
But others do understand and their principles are not focused on the wellbeing of mankind. They simply do what they want to do.
They are thinking they should have fun and enjoy life. They do not shed a single tear when they see poor people suffering in the rest of the world and would rather not think about it. 
They do not care for religion, neither are they against it — the people against it, atheists, are against God because they either think that religion causes more war in the world or because it has destroyed their life, as orthodoxy often does with young people. In the Bible belt for example people are socially oppressed and emotionally suppressed and there is no actual freedom, it is legalism.
But they too are doing this out of empathy for others, their intentions are good — though not that of all atheists. 
These people are the wayward people, the current and the previous generation who are nonchalant about everything, news, politics, education. They are people who care only about the weekend because that is when they are partying. I am referring to the Chinese generations in the Netherlands at Asian Parties (clubs). Of course not everyone there is guilty of being wayward, some are actually looking for innocent fun, but find out they cannot get it at places like that. But I presuppose, without having done any research, that most of them are wayward. 
I have known many of them and have found out that they are superficial to their core. They keep on partying and spending money on material matters until they are forty and then realize they should have finished their education, saved some money and spent it on a house instead of on a car. They are single and realize they have not invested in children. They either get children at a very late age or do not get children at all. If they get children, they are too old to spend a lot of energy on them and because they wasted away their time on partying and purposeless jobs and other time spending activities, they did not read and obtain the knowledge to bring up a child. 
They do not have any real friends, because they did not invest in relations, except in those whom they met at parties and clubs. But as we all know from the story of the Prodigal Son, these friends will leave you when they get the chance. 
These people are sad and bitted, and even at that age they are reluctant in accepting the Good News. For too long they have lived without a god to rule their lives, except their own god, which is themselves or Mammon, i.e. money. Why ever would they allow the god of gods, Yahweh, to rule their life right now? Especially now they are older, they are more reluctant to listen to others, they are adults and mature—at least, that is what they think.
