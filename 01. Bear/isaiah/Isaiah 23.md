**Isaiah 23 (NIV) A Prophecy Against Tyre**
*1 A prophecy against Tyre:*
*Wail, you ships of Tarshish!*
*For Tyre is destroyed*
*and left without house or harbor.*
*From the land of Cyprus*
*word has come to them.*
*2 Be silent, you people of the island*
*and you merchants of Sidon,*
*whom the seafarers have enriched.*

As God stops family lines in Israel and Judah, the water in Egypt, turns the refugee providing country of Arabia into refugees themselves, turns rich families into wailing single survivors in Moab, He now sets His focus on Tyre. More specifically, the logistics of it. In all cases God influences the economy for all of the above are part of economic policies. 
Tyre was (as I remember) a rich city built by the sea, its economy built on its logistic advantage of being near the shore, and strengthened by its seafarers, which in port cities can be majority of the city's (or even a country's) income.

*3 On the great waters*
*came the grain of the Shihor;*
*the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre,*
*and she became the marketplace of the nations.*
*4 Be ashamed, Sidon, and you fortress of the sea,*
*for the sea has spoken:*
*“I have neither been in labor nor given birth;*
*I have neither reared sons nor brought up daughters.”*
*5 When word comes to Egypt,*
*they will be in anguish at the report from Tyre.*

Many nations will be shocked—perhaps even sad—to hear that Tyre is no longer. Shocked because of the suddenness. These countries themselves do not see the growing heresy and resistance against God, of course, so they did not see the warning signs that God gave them and to Tyre. But they will be shocked as well to  see a so-called fortress being conquered by another people. Of course they are forgetting that Tyre had been conquered in the past as well. 

The third reason. Another interpretation is that the sea is childless and so the city of Tyre will be. 
The reason why they are sad is another one. It is because they will not have a resting place anymore in that area. The merchant made good money with their trade in the city. 
They will not enjoy the sinful pleasures of this city anymore. And to think that that is something to be sad about. 

But is the sea sad? No it is not. It is ruthless and relentless. It says that it has never to given birth to anyone before. So Tyre is not her child. Perhaps Tyre claimed so or thought it was. But the sea did not protect Tyre from their enemies. 
Tyre did not realize it was the lost son of the Heavenly Father, and praying to the wrong parent has great consequences. 

*6 Cross over to Tarshish;*
*wail, you people of the island.*
*7 Is this your city of revelry,*
*the old, old city,*
*whose feet have taken her*
*to settle in far-off lands?*



*8 Who planned this against Tyre,*
*the bestower of crowns,*
*whose merchants are princes,*
*whose traders are renowned in the earth?*
*9 The Lord Almighty planned it,*
*to bring down her pride in all her splendor*
*and to humble all who are renowned on the earth.*

Human-wise, Tyre expected some courtesy or diplomacy for the services it rendered to its royal and renowned merchants. In the world it indeed received this courtesy, but God does not look with the same eyes as we do. What we think we deserve because we have done great things, to God is nothing but child's play, which would be even overstating it. 
To God a king on this Earth is nothing more than a human being whom God granted the right to be king, and a billionaire is nothing more than a person God with *God*-given talents put in the right time and place.

*10 Till your land as they do along the Nile,*
*Daughter Tarshish,*
*for you no longer have a harbor.*

And now it is Tarshish' turn, which is probably Spain, to suffer the same fate as her "mother-country", the country that feeds her economically through seafaring trade. If Tarshish' main business parter does not exist anymore, then Tarshish is doomed to go the same way. That is why God is telling her to do as the Egyptians do, start farming land as a way of income. 

*11 The Lord has stretched out his hand over the sea*
*and made its kingdoms tremble.*
*He has given an order concerning Phoenicia*
*that her fortresses be destroyed.*

God needs to do nothing more than give a command, speak out a word, if even He has to, for He can also think a thought and it will happen inevitably. 

*12 He said, “No more of your reveling,*
*Virgin Daughter Sidon, now crushed!*
*“Up, cross over to Cyprus;*
*even there you will find no rest.”*

Can you understand that people were reveling in their pride of being a wealthy and safe nation. Their probably boasted in their pride and were not afraid other countries would attack for they literally provided a safe haven. 
They were aware of the destruction the Assyrians were causing in the neighboring countries, from Iran and Syria all the way to Egypt and Cush. Yet they were reveling, insensitive of the hurts of others and now that they themselves were punished for that, they could not cross over to other countries, like Cyprus, perhaps because Cyprus was under fire as well, but most probably because they were not providing a safe haven for fugitives from other countries, although I am not aware if this is a fact. 

*13 Look at the land of the Babylonians,*
*this people that is now of no account!*
*The Assyrians have made it*
*a place for desert creatures;*
*they raised up their siege towers,*
*they stripped its fortresses bare*
*and turned it into a ruin.*
*14 Wail, you ships of Tarshish;*
*your fortress is destroyed!*

The land of the Babylonians, which is probably the land surrounding the city of Babylon, a big city even in the period of the Assyrians, but not yet a kingdom as large as it would later on become, was destroyed by the Assyrians and made into a desert into which nothing can live. Just like the Romans and probably every other empire, they burned down cities. Perhaps to prevent people from rising up if anyone is left alive who could take revenge. 
I do not understand the logic of increasing an empire while shutting down cities at the same time. The land of the empire will increase then, but the number of people will diminish. The Romans "shut down" some of the cities, by burning it down and pouring salt over it, so that nothing would ever grow there and no one would ever want to live there. 
The Assyrians made this mistake by keeping the Babylonians alive. They did not realize the Babylonians would rise up again and slaughter all of the Assyrians. 

*15 At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the span of a king’s life. But at the end of these seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:*
*16 “Take up a harp, walk through the city,*
*you forgotten prostitute;*
*play the harp well, sing many a song,*
*so that you will be remembered.”*

Tyre might have been forgotten, in that sense that no one exactly knew what it was anymore. In the same way Jerusalem and Israel had been forgotten by that generation that was banished to Babylon. The ones going there were young, like Daniel, and as soon as the old ones died, only a story was left for the next generation. 
Daniel himself, perhaps only 16 years of age when he went to Babylon, would then have been 86 after these seventy years of abduction, first and in part by the Babylonians (about 10 years, I think) and afterwards by the Medes and the Persians for the bigger remaining part. A large part of the second and third generation, after Daniel's, however, would stay in Persia, and hear stories from people who had never been to Israel and had only heard these stories from others themselves. 
So it would be with the people from Tyre. The next generations would only hear stories and a minor part would go back to the city itself. The culture would be gone, but there would be enough "new" religions to pick up. Unlike the situation in Israel where there too were a lot of new religions, but the difference being that the Jews had the Bible and they had the Holy Spirit telling them the true stories of the past in case of any incorrectness. 

*17 At the end of seventy years, the Lord will deal with Tyre. She will return to her lucrative prostitution and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. 18 Yet her profit and her earnings will be set apart for the Lord; they will not be stored up or hoarded. Her profits will go to those who live before the Lord, for abundant food and fine clothes.*

And so the people Tyre get a second chance as well, to go back to their city and start trading again with all kingdoms of the Mediterranean and further abroad to wherever there are rivers. Not only the materials would be traded there between the different kingdoms, but the religions and religious artifacts would be as well.
But Tyre's gain from this would be stored up and used for Judah. I do not remember exactly, but Nehemiah was allowed to go to Jerusalem and rebuild the city gates. He received many building materials from the Persian king Cyrus (the Great), including wood, perhaps Lebanese cypress wood, the same area where Tyre is. Could it be that the Bible is referring to these materials? And could it be that Tyre had to pay for these herself? 
This would only be possible if the seventy years referred to here started earlier than the seventy years in which Israel was banished. #todo/opzoeken  In Nehemia opzoeken of dit waar is.
