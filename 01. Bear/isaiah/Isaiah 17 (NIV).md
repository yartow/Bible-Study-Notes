# Isaiah 17 (NIV) 
**A Prophecy Against Damascus**

*1 A prophecy against Damascus:*
*“See, Damascus will no longer be a city*
*but will become a heap of ruins.*
*2 The cities of Aroer will be deserted*
*and left to flocks, which will lie down,*
*with no one to make them afraid.*
*3 The fortified city will disappear from Ephraim,*
*and royal power from Damascus;*
*the remnant of Aram will be*
*like the glory of the Israelites,”*
*declares the Lord Almighty.*

All cities in and surrounding Israel will be destroyed, unless the Babylonians had something in mind for this town. 

*4 “In that day the glory of Jacob will fade;*
*the fat of his body will waste away.*

Israel has been attacked many times for its disobedience to God and every time the consequences were just dire enough to let the people repent, only so long that the current generation remembered it, but the next generation would forget God's help in the past. But whatever the punishment was from God, after God stopped the punishment, the people could grow back to a healthy society and economy. 
Not so this time. God left no "fat" on the body for it to restore itself. This means that God decimated the population in such a way that it could barely sustain itself. Ten out of twelve tribes were taken captive in Assyria never to be heard of again, probably preceded by thousands—or even tens or hundreds of thousands—of deaths, and a large part of the remaining two tribes was taken captive to Babylonia. Most importantly, these were the intellectual and royal people. 
Without intellectual capital a country cannot be built—at least, not in a healthy way. Farmers and blue collar workers were left behind to take care of the land and even though part of the agricultural knowledge was preserved there, there was intellectual capital in politics and religion, or better said, theological knowledge. This seems very minor, but it is the basis of building a country. For the foundation on which a country is built cannot be changed anymore, and the foundations are laid in what the country believes in. We saw that the Samaritan woman at the well did not even know where to praise God. Aside from that, the Samaritans probably had some wrong ideas of moral values as well. 
Summarizing, God destroyed the country at its core, the people needed to inhabit it. God showed a warning, several of these as a matter of fact, to lightly show the Israelites what the consequences are if people are killed. But they did not heed the warnings and kept on sinning.

#todo/opzoeken  How many killed during Assyrian and Babylonian wars in Israel and in the rest of the world? 
How many taken captive to Assyria? Several thousands, according to [Assyrian captivity - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_captivity). But not certain, because Chronicles says "everyone", while in later chapters it speaks of King Hezekiah sending letters to some remnant cities, thus not everyone was taken. 
How many taken captive to Babylonia?
What was royal about the captives? Descending from David?

*5 It will be as when reapers harvest the standing grain,*
*gathering the grain in their arms—*
*as when someone gleans heads of grain*
*in the Valley of Rephaim.*
*6 Yet some gleanings will remain,*
*as when an olive tree is beaten,*
*leaving two or three olives on the topmost branches,*
*four or five on the fruitful boughs,”*
*declares the Lord, the God of Israel.*

God gives an answer here to historians. There will always be people who remain in a land, "four or five" when the bough was fruitful, but that is out of hundreds of or perhaps even more than a thousand olives. #todo/opzoeken  how many olives usually on a (fruitful) bough? 
I do not know the exact numbers, but in percentages this would be very small. 
When in Chronicles the author speaks of "everyone" he thus most likely means "everyone except these remaining people". 
Thus this does not have to be a contradiction with the facts or with other statements in the Bible. 

*7 In that day people will look to their Maker*
*and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.*
*8 They will not look to the altars,*
*the work of their hands,*
*and they will have no regard for the Asherah poles*
*and the incense altars their fingers have made.*
*9 In that day their strong cities, which they left because of the Israelites, will be like places abandoned to thickets and undergrowth. And all will be desolation.*

There will be a day, how unlikely that may sound and how long that may be, but there will be a day that people will look to their Maker. Even though they do not realize right now that God is their Maker, they will come to realize that in an instant. 
Just like some people come to conversion in this age and believe Christ is real and that He really died for us, these converts realized through some sort of action that God was real. Josh McDowell realized it after reading a fact that tipped him over. Lee Strobel knew God was real when he summed up all of his facts and there was more evidence *for* God than *against* Him—although I am wondering what evidence there is *against* God. #todo/opzoeken  Lee Strobel Saddleback Ahmanson lecture
I say "instant" because knowing God or as people say, "*believing* God is real", happens in a split second. There might be many events that lead a person up to a certain point, but the actual realization is just one instance, that is, the instance that God shows Himself, either through facts or through some act of love—although facts too are out of love, though the relation is more difficult to see there. 
One day these people will realize that all of their past life has been futile in reaching joy and peace, while life with God *is*—I tend to say, *by definition*—joy and peace. And those who realize this, not those who *only* get to *taste* this and thus are not even believers (in this sense I agree with MacArthur concerning the discussion whether believers who are once saved are always saved) will *leave* their old gods and idols. 
#todo/opzoeken  taste of the gospel, where in the Bible?
This implies that those who do not leave their old gods and idols have not been saved, or in other words, they have not seen God with their own "spiritual eyes". 

*10 You have forgotten God your Savior;*
*you have not remembered the Rock, your fortress.*

Without God everything is futile. It is sad that Solomon had to discover this the hard way. Even he, in all of his wisdom, could not comprehend the vastness of God's wisdom and that it is impossible for man fully "control" this knowledge. All that is possible is following the laws of God. Two simple commands was all Solomon had to know: #todo/opzoeken  where in the Bible in the Old Testament? 
> Love the Lord your God with all your heart, your mind, your will and your strength and [...] love your neighbor as yourself.   
And if he did not know how, he could have followed the Ten Commandments which prohibit any idolization and following of other gods. As for the other commandments, those he probably have kept. There was no need for him to lie or to covet—but there are two commandments he did not keep, except for the former two, i.e. the first two of the Ten Commandments, no other gods and no creation of idols and worship thereof. 
The additional two commandments he did not keep are "honoring your parents". Honoring your parents does not always occur through keeping the same religion and paying respect to the god of your father (or parents), but in this case it is legitimate to say that Solomon willingly and knowingly did not respect the God of David, his father, by breaking so many rules and leading the country with him. 
#todo/opzoeken  Has David ever said something about God to Solomon or made Solomon promise to always follow God?
The second command Solomon broke is that of adultery. Even if Solomon did not have any sex outside of marriage, his intercourse with all women except for the first one, was adultery because it happened outside of that first marriage. And what not to say of his concubines? Can they be counted as wives at all? 

*Therefore, though you set out the finest plants*
*and plant imported vines,*
*11 though on the day you set them out, you make them grow,*
*and on the morning when you plant them, you bring them to bud,*
*yet the harvest will be as nothing*
*in the day of disease and incurable pain.*

That is what happens when one forgets his Foundation, the Rock. Everything one has is futile if it is not built on the right foundation. And so the rest of verse 10 and 11 tells us that even the finest plants and imported vines, those who are even about to bud, will not produce any significant amount of fruit. 
I have once purchased fruit or vegetable plants which were not *about* to bud, but were *already* budding. There were already tomatoes on it that were. Somehow, the environment was not plant-friendly. It could have been the air or the water, but I managed to get about two tomatoes to ripe, but the rest died and those about to bud shrunk and discolored until the whole plant died in a matter of days. The same happened with an orchid fully [in de bloei], but died out anyway. 
#todo/opzoeken  in de bloei
Budding and [bloeien] are not guarantees for its fruit.
The last two lines of verse 11 add something extra to the context:
> *yet the harvest will be as nothing*  
> *in the day of disease and incurable pain.*  
In English this can be interpreted in two ways. The first interpretation is that the harvest is *nothing*, which is already bad, but it occurs during at a time where many are sick and have incurable pains, which makes the situation even worse. In a time where people are sick, a harvest could have at least fed people and heal those who could be healed, and not cure those with incurable pains, but perhaps soften those pains. If anything the harvest could have been sold so medicine could be purchased to help the sick. 
The second interpretation is that this disease and pain could be so widespread and intense that even a full harvest would amount to nothing. It seems like the thousands of euros we collected for Open Doors, I think it was about 50.000 euros, during a dinner for entrepreneurs, for three goals, Syria, India and Nigeria. But Syria alone needed (and in 2018 *still* needs!) 1.5 million euros a year to feed 15.000 families, and that is for food alone, not calculating the costs for clothing, medicine and other basic needs such as heat, electricity and housing, let alone the most important thing, Bibles and other evangelical support. 
During a leadership seminar by Compassion I got the same feeling of despair, for it needed 150 million to care for all its children and still, they were caring for, perhaps, only 1% of all children in poverty. Compassion and all other organizations together, including even the non-Christian ones, would probably not even reach 5% of all children or people in  situations of extreme poverty. 

*12 Woe to the many nations that rage —*
*they rage like the raging sea!*
*Woe to the peoples who roar —*
*they roar like the roaring of great waters!*

God gives a woe to everyone bad. This woe sounds like a weak word. Why would anyone be afraid of words? The answer is that these are not mere words, but they are words with a message, a message of warning that is. 
God may let people know of this woe through a letter, which will not come across strongly. If people are not afraid of words, they most certainly are not afraid of words on paper. Or He might send the message through the mouth of a prophet, this will have more effect, but as seen in Judges and the story of Jonah in Nineve, this effect lasts only for about a generation. Or He could tell it to people themselves, like He did with a voice like that of thunder on Mount Moriah when God spoke to the Israelites. 
#todo/opzoeken  Mount Moriah? Or another one? What is that other mount that Muslims worship?
But no matter how small the voice, if there is one at all, it is about the message and the people then, and now, forget about this or do not realize this. 
There is a great message in this world today coming from all churches. Movies like *2012* are even mocking this message. It is the message of John the Baptist, 
> like a voice calling in the desert #todo/opzoeken  referentie?   
or "out of the desert", but either way, who can hear this voice calling in the desert? No one, that is. It was as if John was calling in the middle of nowhere. Churches today, even if they are not in the outskirts of town but are in downtown Manhattan or LA, with big posters and many broadcasts on social media, proclaiming a message of repentance because the Savior is going to come, are ignored. This is not for any reason found by analytics, such as that people are becoming dull because of hearing this too often or because they are using the wrong media, or because Christians are hypocritical and therefore the message does not arrive. No, it is purely ignored because the people of this world do not see past these words. They do not see that it is a message *from God* and that it is a *warning*.
Unlike the people in Nineve, who only got forty days to repent, the people of this day are getting a lot more time to repent. Instead of using this time, however, to not only repent but to call on others to repents as well, to make up for what they have missed and done wrong in the past, they completely heed the warning and even prevent others from listening to it. Rather yet, they are even spending their time and making it their purpose to prevent people from repenting and listening to this message. 
This is so confusing. If one person does not believe this message and wants to live his life as he wants to, then why does he need to prevent others from listening to it? The answer is that he is unsure of whether he is has made the correct choice. But if others can support him in this choice, then he will become more certain.

*13 Although the peoples roar like the roar of surging waters,*
*when he rebukes them they flee far away,*
*driven before the wind like chaff on the hills,*
*like tumbleweed before a gale.*
*14 In the evening, sudden terror!*
*Before the morning, they are gone!*
*This is the portion of those who loot us,*
*the lot of those who plunder us.*

As for realization, this is the whole point. If only they realized they were like chaff or like tumbleweed—weed that breaks loose from its roots as soon as there is a strong wind—then, perhaps, they would listen to this warning. It is due to lack of realization that tomorrow they may be gone. Some discover this, and yet again, they make movies about it without realizing the full catastrophe (such as the *Pursuit of Happiness*). Yes, one day your career, your house and everything you have built up, including your family, may be gone (like in Alec Baldwin's case), but they do not realize that the most important thing of all, their life, may be gone as well. In an instant.
