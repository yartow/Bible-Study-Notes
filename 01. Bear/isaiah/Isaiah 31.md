# Isaiah 31

**Woe to Those Who Rely on Egypt**
*1 Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help,*
*who rely on horses,*
*who trust in the multitude of their chariots*
*and in the great strength of their horsemen,*
*but do not look to the Holy One of Israel,*
*or seek help from the Lord.*

Can I say that it was not wrong to go down to Egypt, but that the intention was wrong? I do not think so. Asking God for help is the first thing the Israelites should have and *only* if God had said they should go to Egypt, it would have been the right thing to do. For God has warned Israel many times never to back to Egypt, not even to get stuff. 
This is why in Deuteronomy God said a king could not have horses, for these were only available in Egypt and God did not want the Israelites to back to Egypt, back to the living hell, to which they are so drawn. 
Egypt is the face of evil. It was the one suppressing the Israelites for 400 years, starting a mass murder of babies—and who knows how many Israelites have died under the harsh conditions of slave labor.
It is where the Israelites learned to worship other gods ,which they had not forgotten for nearly 3000 years. This is which brought on the greatest disasters for Israel, her adultery came from this reason and her reluctance to obey God and rebellion against Him. 
The whole book of Judges would not have contained disasters if only the Israelites had stayed faithful to God. All of the disasters and punishments starting from Solomon's day, 1 Kings—though effectually starting in his son's day—until the last page of the Old Testament, would not have occurred if only the Israelites had stayed loyal to the One God.

That is actually the second great sin they committed, going to Egypt. The first great sin is that of not relying on God. If you do not rely on God, it does not matter who you are asking for help, any action to involve anyone would be a sin, because God would not be part of the solution. 

*2 Yet he too is wise and can bring disaster;*
*he does not take back his words.*
*He will rise up against that wicked nation,*
*against those who help evildoers.*

The Israelites thought only the Assyrians or the Egyptians—I am not really what "too" is referring to—were wise and could bring disaster; They forgot about their own God, Who can do much more than that. They forgot about the promise God made to destroy this nation, a promise most probably made in a different book than this book of Isaiah. At least a general promise in Genesis to Abraham—I think—where God promises to rescue His people when they repent, and examples of that in Judges, which the Israelites should have access to. (I assume Kings was not written yet or they did not have access to it.)

What makes the second sin even worse is the nature of the Egyptian people. If verse 2 is referring to the Egyptians, this means that they were people who helped out evildoers. It is like those people in the United States who helped out Hitler during the war, to make a profit themselves. 

*3 But the Egyptians are mere mortals and not God;*
*their horses are flesh and not spirit.*
*When the Lord stretches out his hand,*
*those who help will stumble,*
*those who are helped will fall;*
*all will perish together.*

Do not anger your God, for if you do, He will strike us all. He needs only stretch His hand and all of us will be inflicted by His imminent wrath and be doomed to fail. We will perish together then with the Egyptians, with the Assyrians—with all who disobey the Lord Almighty, creator of the heavens and the Earth. 

*4 This is what the Lord says to me:*
*“As a lion growls,*
*a great lion over its prey—*
*and though a whole band of shepherds*
*is called together against it,*
*it is not frightened by their shouts*
*or disturbed by their clamor —*
*so the Lord Almighty will come down*
*to do battle on Mount Zion and on its heights.*

We forget that the Lord is not afraid of anything and that He will not stop at anything to save His beloved ones, even if it means killing off the remainder of His people and the destruction of this world. To save a few He had slaughtered Sodom and murdered Gomorrah, even though these few were not as righteous as Abraham and were filled with immoral behavior, as shown when Lot's daughters performed detestable practices with their father, and Lot's surrender to drunkenness, which is not allowed.
Would our Lord not give up the whole world to save His children, who are in number more than Lot and his family? The Lord even says this later on in this book, in Isaiah 43:4:
> ... I will give *people* in exchange for you, *nations* in exchange for your life.   
Nothing, absolutely nothing can frighten our King and nothing will threaten Him or stop Him from doing what He needs to do. 

*5 Like birds hovering overhead,*
*the Lord Almighty will shield Jerusalem;*
*he will shield it and deliver it,*
*he will ‘pass over’ it and will rescue it.”*

The Lord has always been watching Jerusalem, He has prevented many things from happening against her. He *will* shield it and deliver, that is, in the future tense. For us, in hindsight, He has already done so. He has not saved the northern Israelites, but He has delivered the southern Jews in Jerusalem. Only those, though I presume He wanted to save more, but the people did not want to be saved and the people were punished for the iniquities of generations of bad kings. 
Is it just to punish the people for the sins of a king? It is the responsibility of a king to carry the responsibility of his people as well. The king will be punished if he does not control his country. How can it go two ways? In this case, the people liked their king, they did not choose him, but they did not reject him either. They followed their kings' examples, by worshipping idols and visiting the temples the kings built. In this way the people sinned themselves on behalf of their own responsibility. So in this case it was just to punish the people. 
Though the people in Jerusalem were just as bad—or worse— than in the rest of Judah, God was gracious to Jerusalem, and also because King Hezekiah was ruling at the time king Sennacherib from Assyria reached Jerusalem. It was because Hezekiah bowed down before God and trusted in His provision, that God was willing to grant her another chance.

What happened to the people in the rest of the nation and in Judah? Those from Israel were deported, though I remember not all of them were. Many were married to Assyrian people afterwards as the Assyrians took over the land. 
But what about the people of Judah? Were the Judahites—except for those in Jerusalem—taken away and deported to Assyria as well? It does not seem that way, neither seems that to be the case of Egypt—or I have never heard of it. So why did the Assyrians do that to Israel? Were the Israelites of so much more importance in intelligence and in beauty? Or was there another reason, something that compelled them to pick this people to include in their kingdom? The compelling being some external force—which is, of course, the God's hand in all this. 

*6 Return, you Israelites, to the One you have so greatly revolted against. 7 For in that day every one of you will reject the idols of silver and gold your sinful hands have made.*

It is such amazing news to hear the Israelites will someday return to God. Of course this will not be all of them, for many have died since this period, of about 700 BC, and many of the few Israelites remaining today will convert to Christianity. But if a good portion of those Israelites return to God, that still is amazing news, for even though they seem to be the smartest people in the world, they seem to be the most stubborn as well. 
40 years of walking in the desert was not enough to make them realize their fault, miracle after miracle was not enough to prove God's existence and greatness. His beauty is not enough to show His goodness and creativity and with that His love for us. 
Even now orthodox Jews are accepting God, but not Jesus; In other worse, they are accepting that God is Lord and Master of their lives, but they are not willing to accept a payment for their ransom from Him, they want to pay it off themselves. They want to be independent still. *God is good and has laws we need to keep,* they think, *but I will not let anyone save me. I will work for my own salvation.* That is why they have left Jesus out of the equation, which really amounts to nothing then—*nil* if I may—for that is like having a car without gas in it: it will not do anything. 
The second amazing thing is that Isaiah is speaking of the *Israelites* here, not the *Jews*. Would this mean the people from northern Israel will be returning? Were they not scattered in the diaspora following the Assyrian invasion in the 8th-6th century BC? How can they return then? This is a question I still have and which could not be answered, nor has it been, by the *Nineveh* exposition in the *museum of ancient history* #todo/opzoeken  in Leiden (2018) on the discovery of Nineveh and other archeological findings on Assyria.

*8 “Assyria will fall by no human sword;*
*a sword, not of mortals, will devour them.*
*They will flee before the sword*
*and their young men will be put to forced labor.*
*9 Their stronghold will fall because of terror;*
*at the sight of the battle standard their commanders will panic, ”*
*declares the Lord,*
*whose fire is in Zion,*
*whose furnace is in Jerusalem.*

Is this sword the Word of God? Perhaps not, because His Word does not devour people, although it does judge them. 
Assyria will fall by the next empire, that of the Babylonians, but verse 8 says this will not be a human sword. Would that mean that the Babylonians were used as a tool but their ultimate perishment is by something supernatural? 
Yes, this verse is referring to the events in Isaiah 37:36,37, where Sennacherib's army is defeated by the angel of the Lord. Although the angel did not kill all of them, for the Lord killed 185.000. Reasoning that Sennacherib would have put soldiers all over his empire and  relying on data from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_the_Neo-Assyrian_Empire) that there were little more than 300 thousand people in his army, this meant that more than half of his army perished in the siege of Jerusalem. This, inevitably, has led to the fall of the Assyrian army. Babylonia had only gather some troops to defeat the thinly spread troops across the empire, which already had a bad morale due to the loss of people. Perhaps Babylonia did not even have to defeat these armies, but merely round them up, asking them to join in on the rebellion against Assyria.

I do not understand, however, what this has to do with young men being forced to labor. Most likely this means that young Assyrian men were being put to forced labor after being captured due to their loss to the Babylonians. 

*9 Their stronghold will fall because of terror;*
*at the sight of the battle standard their commanders will panic, ”*
*declares the Lord,*
*whose fire is in Zion,*
*whose furnace is in Jerusalem.*

Jerusalem will be the place from where God not only judges the nations, but punishes them accordingly. It is like an offensive defense, as in *I will not hurt you, but as soon as you start attacking my city, I will get back at you.* 
God has already passed His judgment through his Word. 
All the nations know of His Word. They know what year it is, and they know that the years are counted from Jesus' birth. 

The world knows it is sinning, the leaders of the nations especially. Even Kim Yong-Un, who was brought up in the pretense of being a god, knows that it is all to keep others under his thumb and that his power stretches only to the borders of his country. Even more, he studied abroad in Switzerland, so he definitely knows about God. 
The leaders know they are corrupt and they allow it to exist in their administration. Legal bribery, you could say, fundraisers to name another thing, are just examples of financial immorality. 
On a social field they are even more morally corrupt, giving in to their own pleasures instead of taking care of their people. 
God has His judgement ready and will carry it out, either in the Day of Judgement or before that. But it will definitely be before the End Times if they attack Jerusalem, His headquarters, His prized city. 
An attack at Jerusalem or Israel is enough to trigger their own demise. Their downfall comes through their arrogance of not only thinking they can do what they want in His world, but also in the land of His people, His children! 
They were already mistreating His children in their own countries, and now they want to invade God's beloved country and mistreat the people on their own turf? How rude can they be? Or out otherwise, how blind can they be? 
If they do not see what is wrong, they must feel it. If they still do not understand and believe history, they will now and know Who is the Highest God.

Jerusalem, like Jesus, is a stumbling block for the nations. The nations cannot go around it. If they do not see it, they they will trip over it and stumble. If they willingly ignore it, they cannot go over it without lifting their foot—if they do not want to fall. In this case, lifting up the foot already means they have not ignored it.
In practice the latter means that something needs to be set in place. They cannot make a decision and then ignore Israel or Jesus. If nations, such as the United States for example, want to ignore this stumbling block and say, for example, *let us just bomb the whole Middle East*, while knowing there is a democratic country in there and thus ignoring Israel, they will have some bad repercussions. I am not talking about the repercussions from the United Nations or of those from people in their country, but from God Himself. What needs to be set in place then—if they do not want to fall—is an exception for Israel, such as *destroy everything except for Israel*.
But what in the former case of not seeing this rock, that is, not knowing Israel is the land  and of God and His people living in it? In this case, too, they will receive repercussions. It does not matter if anyone sees the stumbling block or not, if one does not lift his foot, he will trip and stumble.
