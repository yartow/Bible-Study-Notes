# Isaiah 13 
**A Prophecy Against Babylon**
*1 A prophecy against Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw:*
*2 Raise a banner on a bare hilltop,*
*shout to them;*
*beckon to them*
*to enter the gates of the nobles.*
*3 I have commanded those I prepared for battle;*
*I have summoned my warriors to carry out my wrath —*
*those who rejoice in my triumph.*

The following is a description of Babylon's downfall. Note that Babylon was not even a world power yet, but already foresaw the destruction of this. Should the Babylonians have access to this letter of Isaiah and want to read, they might have prevented a lot of deaths by humbling themselves for God.
I do not know what "them" means in verse 2 nor what the "gates of the nobles" are. #biblestudy/questions But it seems that "them" refers to those people from countries other than Babylon, who are willing to take part in the war against Babylon. God has chosen some to carry out His wrath and those who are willing to aid God in this are in fact the *nobles*, even though they are not Israelite. 
Note that this prophecy against Babylon is valid for both the fall of Babylon as well as the fall of the evil empire of this world at the end of the ages. 

*4 Listen, a noise on the mountains,*
*like that of a great multitude!*
*Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms,*
*like nations massing together!*
*The Lord Almighty is mustering*
*an army for war.*
*5 They come from faraway lands,*
*from the ends of the heavens —*
*the Lord and the weapons of his wrath —*
*to destroy the whole country.*

What will the Lord do when this world is coming to an end? Is it something we can expect? It was non unexpected that countries would work together in order to defeat an existing world power. Egypt, though being the enemy of Israel, had (more than once?) worked together with North-Israel, at least once they had done so in their failed collaboration to defeat Assyria.
If there will be a world power, be it the Illuminati, China or even the United States itself, which countries will work together to destroy that world power then? Will it be countries who have previously worked together? Will it geographically be the same, will the great enemy literally come from the East?

*6 Wail, for the day of the Lord is near;*
*it will come like destruction from the Almighty.*
*7 Because of this, all hands will go limp,*
*every heart will melt with fear.*
*8 Terror will seize them,*
*pain and anguish will grip them;*
*they will writhe like a woman in labor.*
*They will look aghast at each other,*
*their faces aflame.*

In this day everyone will be afraid. This is not really described in this part except for the term "every heard", so I might be wrong about that. The part where literally *everyone* is afraid is when God appears, there is no exception about that. But when this war comes, it is possible that some will not be afraid, because just like in World War II, they are either making a profit out of this war or they are part of the (direct) cause of this war as well, as generals for example.
But if it really is everyone, then I can imagine that this would be a war consisting of airplanes, tanks and humans all fighting each other at once, where the casualty rate is higher than in Vietnam and more like those of the ancient wars and no one gets to survive or taken captive. 
Who would not be afraid to fight against a tank, to be a front-liner and buy time with your life just so that the people behind you have enough time to blow up this tank? It is a war where many will die on both sides. 

*9 See, the day of the Lord is coming*
*—a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger —*
*to make the land desolate*
*and destroy the sinners within it.*
*10 The stars of heaven and their constellations*
*will not show their light.*
*The rising sun will be darkened*
*and the moon will not give its light.*

This is what has happened to the evil city of Babylon and will happen to one the present cities. Now I can think of some evil cities, such as San Francisco and Rio de Janeiro, where moral values have shrunk to a minimum on areas that God values so much. Sexuality has no meaning anymore in the former and in the latter poverty is more standard than exception due to extortion, drugs and gangster practices. But they do not feel like world powers to me, like Babylon was. I would imagine a city like New York which controls much of the world's money or something like Silicon Valley, which controls the technology of this world. Perhaps we are not at the end of the end times yet and one of those cities is an important city, like Babylon was at the time of Assyria's reign, but it will become a world power after Assyria's fall.

**What is America is the Assyria spoken of in the Bible? And Trump is Nebuchadnezzar?** 
**Or Trump could be the Persian king, Cyrus, who ultimately lets the Jews return to Israel, rebuild the wall and "saves" the Jews.** 
**What if Trump is the anti-Christ for he acts good but is not.** 


*11 I will punish the world for its evil,*
*the wicked for their sins.*
*I will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty*
*and will humble the pride of the ruthless.*
*12 I will make people scarcer than pure gold,*
*more rare than the gold of Ophir.*
*13 Therefore I will make the heavens tremble;*
*and the earth will shake from its place*
*at the wrath of the Lord Almighty,*
*in the day of his burning anger.*

Not only the rich and the wicked will be punished, but the arrogant, the haughty, the proud and the ruthless will all be ended. God is not talking about merely humbling people here, he is talking about ending the lives of people, so much that it will be even hard to find people.
#biblestudy/questions **How many Israelites have died in the Assyrian wars and how many Babylonians in the Persian conquest?** 
I can imagine very well how the Persians would not leave a single person alive.
Not only by wars will they die, but by natural and supernatural powers will they perish. Earthquakes are probably what is referred to by a trembling earth, but what is a shaking heaven? Would that be lightning? Or wind? 
Either way, it would suffice in killing thousands and millions of people. 

*14 Like a hunted gazelle,*
*like sheep without a shepherd,*
*they will all return to their own people,*
*they will flee to their native land.*
*15 Whoever is captured will be thrust through;*
*all who are caught will fall by the sword.*
*16 Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes;*
*their houses will be looted and their wives violated.*
*17 See, I will stir up against them the Medes,*
*who do not care for silver*
*and have no delight in gold.*
*18 Their bows will strike down the young men;*
*they will have no mercy on infants,*
*nor will they look with compassion on children.*

It is clear here that the Babylonians will meet their fall at the hands of the Medes. But God aids in that too, for it was the Babylonians who killed many of His people in the first place.
I find it strange, however, that God would kill them for that, when He Himself ordered the Babylonians to capture the Jews. Perhaps it is just that. God wanted the Babylonians to capture the Israelites, not to kill them, not to take them as slaves and impregnate them, causing Samaritans to exist, and most certainly not to force upon them their own hideous religion of worshipping idols and even the king himself, Nebuchadnezzar.
Also, I think, even without intervention of God the Babylonians probably would have wanted to conquest Israel for its fertility, the beautiful women and smart people, and of course because of its riches which they were aware of by Hezekiah. 
God allowed them and most probably led them towards the right time to do it and perhaps even prevented many more killings.

*19 Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms,*
*the pride and glory of the Babylonians,*
*will be overthrown by God*
*like Sodom and Gomorrah.*
*20 She will never be inhabited*
*or lived in through all generations;*
*there no nomads will pitch their tents,*
*there no shepherds will rest their flocks.*
*21 But desert creatures will lie there,*
*jackals will fill her houses;*
*there the owls will dwell,*
*and there the wild goats will leap about.*
*22 Hyenas will inhabit her strongholds,*
*jackals her luxurious palaces.*
*Her time is at hand,*
*and her days will not be prolonged.*

God fulfills His own prophecies of course, so if He says Babylon will not be inhabited, it will not be inhabited. Just like with Jericho, God promised that anyone who would inhabit it, would see the death of his own. This actually happened, twice even, as far as I remember. 
Not to doubt God, but later on, in the time of Elisha, a person from Jericho came up to him. Would this not mean that people were living in Jericho then? Though not "inhabitable", because of brackish water, #todo/opzoeken  or was it some other kind of problem with the water? 
people were living there. 
God's promise, however, was that no one would establish a city there. Perhaps there were only a few people living there, say a village, but most definitely not a city. 
#todo/opzoeken  What was the actual and literal promise and prophecy of God concerning Jericho? Was this story about brackish water really in Jericho?
In this case though, God promises that Babylon will not even be inhabited by nomads or shepherd, only desert creatures, owls, jackals and wild goats and hyenas will dwell there, not the most beautiful creatures. 

It is striking that the most beautiful places cause the worst desolations. The hanging gardens of Babylon were one of the world's greatest wonders made by men, meaning there must have been some sort of water for this to exist. But where is Babylon now and where is this source of water? 
Sodom and Gomorra were big cities in the beautiful area of ... 
#todo/opzoeken  where was this? 
and these are gone too. It is a shame that the these beautiful places had to be destroyed because of the evil people living there. 

The same thing goes for people, it is a shame that the most talented and beautiful people are destroyed because they are evil. It is a known phenomenon that music stars, actors and actresses usually do not live long. More often than not, it seems, they use drugs and end their own lives, sometimes literally. But most importantly, they lead other people to follow them and that is what God detests.
