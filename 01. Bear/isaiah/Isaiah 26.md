**Isaiah 26 (NIV) A Song of Praise**
*1 In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:*
*We have a strong city;*
*God makes salvation*
*its walls and ramparts.*
*2 Open the gates*
*that the righteous nation may enter,*
*the nation that keeps faith.*
::*3 You will keep in perfect peace*::
::*those whose minds are steadfast,*::
::*because they trust in you.*:: 
*4 Trust in the Lord forever,*
*for the Lord, the Lord himself, is the Rock eternal.*

It was hard to imagine, to still have hope, when we saw that Israel was constantly attacked by the Palestinians and no one outside the fight between Israel and the Islam, was helping the Israel. Even Israel's only ally, the United States was only making things worse under the Obama administration. 
Under Trump, however—ever more likening a man sent by God, though time must tell—the United States' embassy was moved back to Jerusalem along with many other countries' embassies. 
Songs of praise could always be sung about You, oh Lord, but songs concerning the care for Israel were dimmed. Now they can be sung again!
It is as written in verse 4, we must trust in You *forever*, always hope there will be a solution and a way out. You will provide one, even though it might not be in our lifetime. But it is not about us, we must pass on this hope to next generations. Those that do so, will have a mind in perfect peace. 

*5 He humbles those who dwell on high,*
*he lays the lofty city low;*
*he levels it to the ground*
*and casts it down to the dust.*
*6 Feet trample it down—*
*the feet of the oppressed,*
*the footsteps of the poor.*

God is righteous and humbles only those He has selected. He is perfect and His election is perfect as well. He knows who are dwelling on high. They might not be the rich, but they are lofty in their hearts. They might not be powerful, but they have enough power to make a change in other people's lives. Yet they choose not to do so. They choose not to build up other lives, so God chooses to break down theirs. The oppressed will be the ones trampling them down. 
I do not think this is referring to a communistic revolution, as occurred in Cuba, Russia and in China, and perhaps in Vietnam and North-Korea as well, but 

*7 The path of the righteous is level;*
*you, the Upright One, make the way of the righteous smooth.*
*8 Yes, Lord, walking in the way of your laws,*
*we wait for you;*
*your name and renown*
*are the desire of our hearts.*

It is because of You, o Lord, that the my path has ever been so level. I have not had many bumps in the road of my life, not steep grounds to cross or holes to dig through. I have always been safe, even though my mother was not strictly religious in the positive sense. Maybe she prayed for me daily, she said she did pray for me, but I do not know how serious her prayers were and how frequent. Maybe it was her mother or father who prayed over his or her children and grandchildren, which had in effect that all five children except for one have come to believe in you, and although three of the five married to an unbeliever, many children are still believe in you.

More likely is that one of the great-grandparents had a deep faith in You and You have blessed Him to the third generation. That would explain why with every generation less people from my family have become Christians. 
It is up to us now to regain this deep faith and this mission to pray for our family so that they can enjoy Your blessing. Not so that in three generations there will be another faithful man or woman of God, but so that every generation will consist of men and women of God who will pray for next generations, their city, their country and their people all across the world. 
Within my family some are actively involved in the church. I do not know much about the Asian branch of our family, but my second uncle from Malaysia has a ministry for rehabilitation of drug addicts (cocaine, I believe) in Thailand and in Singapore my oldest cousin Daniel and his sister still regularly attend church, though I have not heard of their ministry. 
Here in the Netherlands my cousin Samuel, who is married to a Cape Verdean, is actively involved in church, my sister and her husband are involved in a multicultural—mostly people of Moroccan and Turkish descent, and Hindi people as well—neighborhood ministering in child care and my wife and I are in a multicultural church, not specifically targeting one group and not yet sure if we should have a community focused on one ethnic group.
With our family we are reaching out to several nations already. Imagine what would happen if every family had one person consistently praying, not working with his hands, but praying—although prayer is work as well! The results would be so big that the whole world would be reached in three generations. 

*9 My soul yearns for you in the night;*
*in the morning my spirit longs for you.*

In the evening my soul comes to rest when it is with You and learning from You. Movies *seem* like they can give my soul rest or that they can satisfy my fantasies, by showing how a hero can save the world. But all of these movies do not satisfy and leave empty holes longing for more. I want to see a sequel or another episode of this hero to see what else he can do and how he conquers his enemies, also I want to know how to story will progress. But Your Word, the Bible, gives us these heroes who do not rely on their own power but on Your power, and the ultimate hero—Jesus—does not use His strength, but His wisdom and humility to change and conquer the world. 
His methods might not seem effective at first, nor efficient, because there are many who do not accept Him as their hero, but eventually Jesus is the only One Who does not contradict Himself. He came to save the world, unlike heroes who only save their only family and most likely kill many innocents on their path to revenge. 
Take for example the movie *Taken* with Liam Neeson. His daughter's best friend was killed, but it did not seem to matter so long as his own daughter was fine. 
But Jesus not only cares about the innocent, even the kidnappers He would rather see alive. Not everybody understands this gentleness of Him. Apart from the theological standpoint that even these kidnappers are His children, Jesus has a striving for moral perfection and a goal that no one can reach. He rather has Himself killed and the kidnappers saved, than to let the kidnappers die. Which hero in Hollywood would do that? 

*When your judgments come upon the earth,*
*the people of the world learn righteousness.*
*10 But when grace is shown to the wicked,*
*they do not learn righteousness;*
*even in a land of uprightness they go on doing evil*
*and do not regard the majesty of the Lord.*

The wicked are truly hard-hearted. You know that better than we do. I ask that You do not show them mercy, but at the same time, I ask that Your will be done. 
Moses was very humble in his deed to pray for the wicked among him, perhaps degrading himself to be a low as they were, for he himself had killed a man with his bare hands, or with some tool in his hands, while the Israelites had not done that yet. The question would be which one would be worse, rebelling against God or killing one out of defense for an innocent person. 
In either case, Moses degraded himself and asked for God's mercy for the Israelites. 
On the other hand, however, Moses was praying for the Israelites. Would he have done the same for other peoples? The wicked currently are non-Christians, Caucasian people, not Asians and most certainly not Chinese, who are my people. I would not pray for the wicked people in China, let alone for those in the United States or in Europe. I consider myself neither Chinese or Dutch. 
Yesterday I saw a movie, *Kingsman: the Golden Circle*, where the president decided that all drug users had to die due to their own mistake of taking drugs and the poison within it, unless he signed an act that would legalize all sorts of drugs. Which would be the greater sin? Eventually, I think the latter would be greater as many more would die, though that cannot be said with certainty. However, the former would not be sin. *Not* signing this law and letting those people would *not* be on his account. Though his intentions were partly—He wanted to go for publicity—and he had a lack of love, did not kill them, they did it to themselves the moment they started using drugs, albeit in a faster way. 
So, theorizing from this we are not accountable for not praying for mercy for the wicked, but when we *do* do so, a great deal of humility is credited to us provided we do this with the right state of heart, as Moses did.
Eventually, Your will be done and if the wicked keep sinning, You will punish them. I had rather they not keep sinning and are stopped right away. I like effectivity and hate to see the innocent afflicted. That is why I would not pray for them. I would pray for the enemy to know You and be converted, but they deserve their punishment, be it through guilt or through corporal infliction.

*11 Lord, your hand is lifted high,*
*but they do not see it.*
*Let them see your zeal for your people and be put to shame;*
*let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them.*
*12 Lord, you establish peace for us;*
*all that we have accomplished you have done for us.*
*13 Lord our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us,*
*but your name alone do we honor.*
*14 They are now dead, they live no more;*
*their spirits do not rise.*
*You punished them and brought them to ruin;*
*you wiped out all memory of them.*

Dear Lord, I praise You for Your wonderful hands and Your lips that set everything in motion and uphold everything at the same time. Just  the power of Your presence makes sure the moon is not drifting away from the Earth faster than it is doing right now. Why are we not feeling anything of our movement around the Sun? There must be some kind of scientific explanation, but the real explanation is because You are upholding us. You are upholding all the energy of every particle in every atom, causing it to have a gravitational force and a resulting magnetic force for our planet, sustained energy and heat providing nuclear reactions on the Sun without the need of external forces preventing the Sun from exploding through uncontrolled chain reaction and preventing it from cooling down and stopping the chemical reactions as well. 
Everything is upheld by You. But "they", both atheists, Buddhists and people of all other religions, and perhaps even theists—all the people except those who acknowledge You and Your work, do not see it.
It is true what is written in Your Word: 1 Cor 5:15 #todo/opzoeken correct reference
> Everything got started in Him and finds its purpose in Him (MSG)   
or 
> For everything has been created by God in heaven and on earth ... (NIV)  
#todo/opzoeken  God upholds everything

This is only *one* thing they do not see, Your *hand*. Now I am asking You to show Your *zeal* for Your people. Show them like You did when You were on Earth, how You destroyed the market place built in the temple; How You scattered the merchants' money all around because it brought You no glory, even though these animals were sacrificed for You and taxation of the money made was for the temple or the priests, who would in return tithe to You as well. 
You do not care about sacrifices and money, for all the wealth on Earth already is Yours as we see in 
> Deuteronomy 10:14 (NIV) 14 To the Lord your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth and everything in it.  
and in 
> Psalms 50:9-12 (NIV) 9 I have no need of a bull from your stall  
> or of goats from your pens,  
> 10 for every animal of the forest is mine,  
> and the cattle on a thousand hills. [...]  
> 12 If I were hungry I would not tell you,  
> for the world is mine, and all that is in it.  
and You desire something more than sacrifice
> *For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgement of God rather than burnt offerings*  — Hosea 6:6 (NIV)  
and 
> My sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise. — Psalms 51:17 (NIV)  


*15 You have enlarged the nation, Lord;*
*you have enlarged the nation.*
*You have gained glory for yourself;*
*you have extended all the borders of the land.*

Any country You desire will be enlarged for Your glory only. You have put Your hand on Egypt at the very beginning and made it the richest country in the world in Joseph time, all because of a prophecy to save all the grain they could. 
Imagining how fat these years were, is difficult for two reason. First, we probably have never had another period of seven years in which the harvest was as rich as back then, or a hunger as severe as back then, which influenced the whole world and lasted for seven years. These were probably miraculous and supernatural events which God allowed for His glory, if only to lead Jacob and His family to Egypt, to fulfill what He said and promised to Abraham, namely that the Israelites would stay in Egypt for 400 years in dire circumstances. 
The second reason is because of a possible discrepancy between the rich and the meager years. On the one hand the Bible speaks of seven meager years which were so severe that the result of the fat years would not be visible anymore. On the other hand Egypt could save enough to cover the meager years. 
Considering a yield of 100% during the first seven years and a minimal yield of 0% in the next seven years, if only 10% of this 100% was saved and deposited in silos and this 10% was enough to cover seven years of hunger, this would mean that people usually consume about 10% of their yield and 80% was a surplus yield. 
Now this 10% was not only enough for Egypt, but for the rest of the world as well. I will assume that there were about ten times as many people in the rest of the world, buying food for their countries. This would mean that approximately 90% of their savings would go to the rest of the world, assuming they did not deny people from buying grain. 
This would change the number of consumption from 10% to 1%. That is, out of a 100% of the yield 10% was saved, and out of that 10%, 1% was used for Egyptian consumption and 9% was for international export. The surplus would then have been 89%, or in other words, in the fat years there would have been a revenue of 9000%. 
I must have made some mistake in my calculation and assumptions. But whether it is scientifically possible or not, God is above science and He will *make* ways to make this kind of revenue and size of grain silos possible. Perhaps we have not even found the majority of these! I remember that some have been found though. #todo/opzoeken  grain silos in Egypt from the time of Joseph. 

*16 Lord, they came to you in their distress;*
*when you disciplined them,*
*they could barely whisper a prayer.*
*17 As a pregnant woman about to give birth*
*writhes and cries out in her pain,*
*so were we in your presence, Lord.*
*18 We were with child, we writhed in labor,*
*but we gave birth to wind.*
*We have not brought salvation to the earth,*
*and the people of the world have not come to life.*

Other nations have been punished by You, but the result was far from them coming back to You. They barely prayed. 
The same it is with my previous congregation. You punished us, it was as if You had left us. People were living together, marrying non believers, almost everyone was in an unequal yoke. Two couples are on the brink of or are already getting divorced. 
Our pastor did not help us and we were suffering. But for what result? Did we bear a beautiful baby? Did we get a revival? Not yet. 
Many of the people present have gone now. Our pastor Johannes, my wife and I, Lichen and Martha, two for the loyal hard workers, the ones wanting a divorce (of course, I would, they do not dare show their face again, even though they are, in a sense, still welcome, though not in a biblical sense), and some are planning to leave. 
But the result would be a lean group where the average motivation is higher than before. Though some of the moet motivated people have left, most of not motivated people are not coming anymore. They have not left in that sense that they were never part of the group, but they such as Lulu and May Chung and Sandra Yau, who were already infrequent visitors.

We can do nothing, but You can, oh Lord. Please help this congregation, the Chinese church in the Netherlands, of their problems. 

*19 But your dead will live, Lord;*
*their bodies will rise—*
*let those who dwell in the dust*
*wake up and shout for joy—*
*your dew is like the dew of the morning;*
*the earth will give birth to her dead.*

Father, we have not been able to accomplish anything. All of our institutions, statutes, reformations have not been able to give life to the dead, to bring people to You. It is Your work through the Holy Spirit that has brought people to our deformed church, which is Your Church which we have not treated well. 
You not only can, but already have let the dead arise. Not only the literal dead, but the figurative dead as well. Those who were dead to their beliefs in You, have been miraculously restored to life. People such as Sir William Mitchell Ramsay (of the Oxford University in England), C.S. Lewis and Lee Strobel have become enormous defenders of the faith, while they were deeply atheist. 
Those filled with passion for everything opposing you, could be turned around. Those without passion for anything, You can give them passion for You as well. 
Please work in us, Father, in our church, in those who have no passion for You. 

*20 Go, my people, enter your rooms*
*and shut the doors behind you;*
*hide yourselves for a little while*
*until his wrath has passed by.*
*21 See, the Lord is coming out of his dwelling*
*to punish the people of the earth for their sins.*
*The earth will disclose the blood shed on it;*
*the earth will conceal its slain no longer.*

The people of this world should be afraid of You. Afraid not only of what you *can* do, but of what You *will* do to them in a short while. You will shed blood, out of vengeance for all the innocent blood that has been shed, blood shed from Your faithful children.
