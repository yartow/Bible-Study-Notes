# Isaiah 57 (ESV) 
**Israel's Futile Idolatry**
*1 The righteous man perishes,*
*and no one lays it to heart;*
*devout men are taken away,*
*while no one understands.*
*For the righteous man is taken away from calamity;*

If a righteous man dies and no cares about it, many will not understand why this is happening on Earth. Should people not be sad when a good man dies? And why is it that *good* men die? It should be the *bad* ones who die. What they do not understand, however, is God's hand in this. 
This man was taken away from calamity. Anant, a 40-year old man in India, was killed, beheaded and survived by his wife and five children—only because he followed Jesus Christ. Why would this happen to a good man and why does most of the world not even know or care about this? Why did these villagers not care about this or even protect him? 
The answer to the latter question is because they were his enemies as well, even though he was not an enemy to them. The villagers were (extremist) Hindus, willing to eradicate Christianity in any way. What is going to happen to Anant's wife and children we can only guess, and pray that God will be merciful to them, and even more merciful to those who inflict harm on this widow and innocent children. 
But perhaps calamity would strike him. What calamity would be worse than death? There once was an Indian Christian, [Nokseng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_Decided_to_Follow_Jesus), who lived in a village where the Hindu extremists gave him three chances to revert to Hinduism to disavow Jesus Christ. See [The Story Behind the Song “I Have Decided to Follow Jesus”](https://emailmeditations.wordpress.com/2014/08/23/499-the-story-behind-the-song-i-have-decided-to-follow-jesus/) for the whole story and [S. Sundar Singh](S. Sundar Singh) who wrote the song. 
He saw his wife and three children die in front of him and yet he still chose to follow Jesus Christ. Would there be any calamity worse than that? The answer might be subjective, but I would think so. The death of a whole village or city would also be devastating for the one who has had so much love for them to give up his previous life and living conditions, quite often it was a safe, successful and wealthy life with family and friends. People like Hudson Taylor, Adoniram Judson and Amy Carmichael who gave up everything to bring the Gospel to China, Birma and India. 
If the whole village refused to believe in God, no matter how many times, there was still a chance that they would come to know God, even after they would die themselves (the missionaries, that is), but if the villagers died, there would be no chance anymore. 
Now, in the case of Sodom and Gomorra it was too late for the inhabitants of those cities. Although I doubt that Lot and his family were mourning for them, God most certainly was for the loss of so many souls, just like He mourned for the demise of Nineveh's many people when they were attacked by the Babylonians. 
Perhaps God wanted to prevent Anant from seeing the calamity, not of his wife's and children's death, but of the punishment God will inflict on this village. 
Why did God take away this Nokseng? In this case it was for another reason. It was to convert the village chief. Perhaps that is the case with Anant as well, but perhaps it is to take him away from calamity. 
Either way, God is great and His works are perfect and within His perfect plan. 

*2 he enters into peace;* #biblestudy/promise
*they rest in their beds*
*who walk in their uprightness.*

This is a confirmation of the above. God promises here that the man who is taken away, the righteous man, will enter into peace. 

*3 But you, draw near,*
*sons of the sorceress,*
*offspring of the adulterer and the loose woman.*

Would God mock or insult any person for his origin merely for the fact that he is born out of an unrighteous person? What can a child do about the fact that he is born from a pagan or worse, a sorceress, or out of an illegitimate consummation? 
God is speaking in figures of speech of course and he is not literally talking about adulterers, but about those who were "married" to God, in His covenant as an Israelite, and yet went after other Gods. Still, if the parents of a certain person are those kind of people, what does that have to do with this person himself? 
Here too, the word offspring must be interpreted not literally as "children of", but more than that. It means that they have descended from these kind of people *and* their behavior is like their parents'.
It is just like a father is telling his child, who is completely different from him, that he is not his offspring, or "you are not my child". He is then talking about his behavior or character, not biology. 

*4 Whom are you mocking?*
*Against whom do you open your mouth wide*
*and stick out your tongue?*

So many sins have been committed by the Israelites—of course keeping in mind that we and the rest of the world have done so too. These Israelites who have followed other gods and worship idols are mocking the Israelites who stay with the Almighty One. Perhaps at one time it *seemed* like YHWH was on the losing side. His country was invaded, His people were in exile, the economy of His nation was as good as gone, without any money or anything of value in it except for people. 
Now too, if I may compare the Israelites to Christians, it seems like the traditional, conservative, Christians are on the losing side or at least becoming a minority, when it comes to gay marriages, divorce and remarriage and other moral issues. Many "Christians" have become influenced by the Left's ideologies and forget about what is written in the Bible. *Real* Christians seem to be on the losing side, it seems like we are losing territory to Islam, atheism and liberal Christianity. Even in perfumery stores, such as *Rituals*, all kinds of scents are sold, such as *the rituals of Ayurveda, Dao, Happy Buddha, Sakura* and *Hammam*—the latter two not being anything religious but just to be *inclusive* for Middle-Eastern (i.e. Islamic) and Asian people—but nothing that has to do with Christianity, although as far as I know Christianity is the only religion which has literally written in its Scripture that we as Christians should spread the *scent of Christ*. 
It seems, I said. I think that is all. It seems like Christians are losing ground, but in reality, it is growing underground or in places where statistics are not well known. In some countries in Africa, and in Asia (such as India and China) growth is unstoppable. Atheism is growing, I think, but only in the West, and though influential, it is but a small part of human society. 
So secular Jews and secular "Christians" are mocking their conservative counterparts, judging them for being old-fashioned and that, for example, "science" has proven that gender is not something biological but rather psychological and therefore we should accept sex changes and same-sex marriages. Yet they fail to see that it is they who are post-modern, that they are the minority and that they are not living according to God's Law. 

*Are you not children of transgression,*
*the offspring of deceit,*
*5 you who burn with lust among the oaks,*
*under every green tree,*
*who slaughter your children in the valleys,*
*under the clefts of the rocks?*

So the first sin by these secular Jews is that they mock the orthodox ones. The second one is that they deceive. They pretend to be really good and to have the best interests for society, but they have random or paid sex under the trees and slaughter children. If the question is asked to those female (often still girls) or male prostitutes, whether they think this is *good* for them, I am pretty sure that everyone will say "no". There is always an exception where some people are addicted to sex or where they lie due to a certain kind of brainwashing, but prostitution is not good. 
If you ask the mothers or parents of these children who are slaughtered whether that is *good*, they too will say—with the exception of those who (wrongfully) claim that due to the offer they have become more fruitful and prosperous. 
But that is not how these priests of paganism proliferate themselves. They present their religion and their actions as beneficial for the land. Prosperity, freedom, equality—for everyone needs to offer their children and have sex in the temple. 
This part describes the third and fourth sin as well, illegitimate sex and human (child) sacrifices, and sacrifices to another god. 

I cannot help but revert to the parallels I see with current-day America. I had written about this before in a previous chapter of Isaiah, but here the parallels are striking once more. 
America (and the West, although America might be leading in that) is promulgating a culture of free sex, with everyone of every sex, at every age—sometimes even between every age—promoting sex through commercials, movies, songs, books, magazines and comics and what not more, and what would be the result of that? STDs, infidelity, broken marriages, divorces, children from dysfunctional families and the accompanying problems in codependency, drug, alcohol and other addictions, and—most foremost—children born outside of marriage or unwanted. The result of the latter is abortion. 
What did the pagans do? They promoted sex and had their children offered to gods in return for prosperity. 
What does the Left do? They promote sex and have unborn children offered in exchange for prosperity. They get prosperity in the form of 
* money, 
* the formation of the distribution of ethnicities and 
* votes 
They get money for services provided by Planned Parenthood, which is also heavily funded by the government. 
They get to to choose the ethnicities of the babies that are being killed, by placing these abortion clinics strategically in minority areas. 
They get votes from these minorities, because they provide this abortion "service" for them, to "help" them continue their career. These votes then allow them to stay in power which continues the vicious circle. 
#church/material

*6 Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion;*
*they, they, are your lot;*
*to them you have poured out a drink offering,*
*you have brought a grain offering.*
*Shall I relent for these things?*

For whom were all of these sacrifices and all of the offers? It is not only to gain this prosperity, verse 6 indicates that it is to worship the gods. Perhaps the worship of these gods was worth more than what the people got from it. Just like in Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism the believers do not actually receive a lot from their gods. Sometimes though, a prayer request is being made to have a child, in the case of a barren woman, but mostly, as far as I am aware, they live in worship for their god(s) simply because they *are* gods. 
This is how Jew and Christians alike should live. That is one point we have in common, or should have in common, awe, fear and respect for our god. But Christians in the flesh—or Christians influenced by the hypergrace doctrine, not started by, perhaps, but gaining massive following under Joseph Prince—have become focused on what God does for us, instead of what we should do for Him.
I do not know what to call the analogous Jews. Secular Jews is not the right word, Jews in the flesh is not an established term, non-orthodox Jews would be descriptive, but still not "it". In any case, those non-orthodox Jew are quite similar to Christians in the flesh, or better yet, the other way around. They go to God to ask for help and if they get it, they will follow Him for a short while. When do not get it, they will find another way of getting it, even if it constitutes worshipping other gods. 
In a sense they have already worshipped something else from the moment they choose to obtain something even when God tells them not to. As soon as they give in to these things, they will float further and further away from God. #todo/opzoeken farther?

The big question God asks in this verse is 
> *Shall I relent for these things?*  
Now what is the answer to that? Of course not! These gifts and offerings were not even for God and even if they were, they do not make up for what the Israelites have done wrong. What matters is a broken spirit and contrite heart (cf. Psalm 51:17). Based on these feeling the offerings must come and will come. One cannot feel remorse and not do anything about it—unless he has no money for a gift or is afraid of something.  

*7 On a high and lofty mountain*
*you have set your bed,*
*and there you went up to offer sacrifice.*

On of the problems that adds to the already imminent problems mentioned before, is that the Israelites were not ashamed or secretive about their worship of pagan gods. Just like the priests of Ashtarte #todo/opzoeken spelling and whether these Babylonians moon and gods were these
and Baal were having sex in public, so the Israelites were publicly performing in worship of idols and perhaps even proselytizing the Jews who were lukewarm in their faith. 
Jesus has said before that those who sin will be punished, but those who let others sin are to be punished exceptionally hard. #todo/opzoeken  where? better than a millstone.

*8 Behind the door and the doorpost*
*you have set up your memorial;*
*for, deserting me, you have uncovered your bed,*
*you have gone up to it,*
*you have made it wide;*
*and you have made a covenant for yourself with them,*
*you have loved their bed,*
*you have looked on ::nakedness::.* #biblestudy/questions

#biblestudy/questions in other translations I only see "saw" and not nakedness or lust for their nakedness. #todo/opzoeken 

The word "premarital sex" keeps popping up in my mind when I read this, which has a similarity with verse 8. The similarity is that in both cases the covenant was made by the persons themself. 
If you marry someone, you do it because you love that person, but because you love God even more, you ask God for permission and you want to marry and be bounded in marriage by God and in His presence. If one does this without God's presence, what would be the reason for that then? This person does not want God to be part of this covenant, and/or he is selfish and wants to have sex without waiting for permission and performing all the rituals around it.
The latter is not what is mentioned in verse 8 though, on the opposite, this person *wants* to have a covenant and he wants it to be without God! Or in other words, he wants a covenant with someone else than God. 
The covenant this person made (note that this is past tense), was intimate, like sex, it made him one with the other party. That makes things even worse, because covenants of these kind are impossible to break without at least one party getting hurt. It is like two pieces of paper stuck together. One cannot separate the two pieces without tearing at least one piece. 
Has there ever been anyone who had a covenant with a fake god, such as Buddha, Allah or Hindu, or one of the pan-gods of nature or of witchcraft, who left that religion without consequences? In the first three cases it is almost certain that the religious group to one belongs will expel him from being part of their lives, sometimes it is even family who does that, mostly in the cases of Islam. 
One must and will always suffer the consequences of one's own actions. Even if they are in the past. 

*9 You journeyed to the king with oil*
*and multiplied your perfumes;*
*you sent your envoys far off,*
*and sent down even to Sheol.*

It is striking to see how far "religious" people, that is those who are lukewarm, go to please others, especially those whom God hates. Verse 9 speaks of giving up oil, journey and envoys. This is like giving up what you care for most, what is most costly, usually money—since perfume was very costly—, your time and effort (the journey taken) and the people you care about most (envoys). But what have these people given to Christ? 
I can only speak of those I know in the church I have been with. I can speak less of those  I know superficially of other churches, but whose leaders I do know well and who have told me about them. Lastly, I can say little about those and their leaders whom I do not know at all, yet if the same phenomenon is observed by many pastors, then there must be a core of truth. 
What then do I say of those people? I say that they indeed give all of the three things mentioned above to their idols. Let us start with money. 

**Perfume**
Many churches are in financial trouble because Christians do not tithe or tithe enough. Of course a lack of financial due diligence is a possible reason as well as an unstable financial foundation, such as having too few Christians and a mortgage that is too high. What troubles me is when I look at their spendings for their phones, food, clothes and make-up. These costs constitute far more than 50% of their income (for teenagers) and for those with jobs and higher incomes I see all kinds of expenses on holidays, housing and cars. 
The second category is time. Money can be saved and decided upon later how to be spent. One can even make up, sort of, by balancing his donations by the end of the year in order to have tithed the "compulsory" ten percent. But it is differently so for time. Ironically, time has a time aspect attached to it. Like food, it can only be kept for a short period of time and one cannot eat a week's worth of food in one go. 

**Journey**
This category as well is dreadfully used mostly for all things but God. God asks us for the smallest amount possible. Two hours during the week in the evening, perhaps three when including traveling time, out of five available evenings; two hours on a Sunday, out of two free days in the weekend; 15 minutes for Bible Study and another 15 minutes for prayer every day out of a 4-6-hour period of availability after work. This is the least one needs to do to at least know a little about a God Who cannot be seen with eyes or heard with ears. This is not even asking for Bible memorizations and working as a volunteer, let alone studying Scripture and preparing for volunteer work on Sunday or other days. 

**Envoys**
The lukewarm do almost everything for those who are close to them. There is nothing wrong with that in itself. The problem lies in choosing or defining wrongly who are close to you. Your family should be close to you, but what do teenagers and young adults often do? They rebel against all authority. They do not listen to their parents' advice or commands, but rather listen to their friends, like Solomon's son Jerobeam did. Even older people still do not take up advice from wise men or from God. 
So in this case the "friends" are closest to them. Let us say that these friends are the envoys. One would not send his friends to hell. No matter how much you need something, if you love this person, you had rather do without that thing you need, than let your friend risk his life by obtaining this for you. 
Unless, of course, there is something worth more than your friends. There are countless examples of people abandoning all they care about in order to pursue this one thing, such as popularity and status. Movies such as *Can't buy me love*, *Dance 'til Dawn* (cf. Tracy Gold's role) as well as the first season of the series *Cobra Kai* (see Ralph Macchio's #todo/opzoeken  role's (Daniel's) daughter), show this kind of behavior where the not popular (often geeky) person drops his best friend(s) in order to become close with the popular kids. 
The figurative king in these examples, or idol, would then be their own idol, which is status, for whom they would sent their envoys, i.e. their best friends, to hell. 

If I am honest, this is not fully how I interpret verse 9. It seems like the oil is brought to the king in order to make perfume with it. Perhaps the king has another (missing) ingredient with which the oil can be made into a perfume. After these perfumes are made, they are sent all around the world to be sold, even to hell. 
Another slightly different interpretation of the last line is that the envoys are sent to get something, and they are even sent to hell.

*10 You were wearied with the length of your way,*
*but you did not say, “It is hopeless”;*
*you found new life for your strength,*
*and so you were not faint.*

MacSBNnkjv does not explain the multiplication of perfumes, but explains that this refers to events like that of king Ahaz who sent gifts (through envoys) to Assyria, which could be seen as hell at that time.
This might better explain this verse when the people of (north) Israel were hopeless yet found new strength in Assyria.
In the case of current day idolatry, people's strength often gets drained as well, ironically *by* this idol. The person is living up to his idol and wants to become like this idol or have. This person wants to be as good a soccer player as (Cristiano) Ronaldo, or obtain fame like Tom Cruise, be as pretty as Jennifer Connelly or as rich as Bill Gates. It takes a lot of time, effort and money to become like them. 
I have seen numerous people going through plastic surgery to look like their idols, externally (cf. the human Barbie, Ken, Michael Jackson and Brad Pitt imitators who have spent tens of thousands up to more than a million dollars on plastic surgery). There were not even after fame and fortune, or after the talents they had, but merely wanted to be that person. The worst thing is, they wanted to be like the person they *think* he was, while it could be very well be that this idol of theirs is much different in real life than on the Internet (cf. Ariane Grande who disses her fans (behind their backs) and actually hates them). 
Then the disappointment comes. The idol does not respond to fan mail, or appears to be different than initially thought, when the fan finally gets to meet him at a concert, he fails in their eyes (e.g. Whitney Houston being addicted to cocaine, Michael Jackson appears to be a pedophile, trumpet player Louis Armstrong had multiple relations with women, and even Martin Luther King had this problem). #tags/famouspeople  All of the hope one had put in the idol is gone. This might feel like a tremendous blow to the chest the blows away all energy and hope for living. It is not rare therefore when people commit suicide upon hearing negative news about their idol. 
But some find strength again, usually in another idol. God is wondering why these all of these pity people do not look for hope in their Creator? God is one who does not ask us to buy statues or posters, to kneel down for them or to listen to their works, such as movies or music. One does not have to stand in line before he can speak with God or wait for a reply as with a human idol. God hears you directly and He answers directly if wishes so, not because He is too busy. If He has something to say to you at a given time, He will do so.
God is never one to fail you. His reputation might be slandered, but that is what it is: *slander*. The press, the media and education here on Earth like gossip magazines who gossip about and slander stars based on rumors, unscientific research and their longings. 
God has one source of truth, His own website, the Bible, which is updated real-time and has a personal blog for every person in the world. Not because each person interprets His Word differently, but because the browser, the Interpreter on the client side, that is the Holy Spirit, speaks to us and shows us what it means. #church/material
In any way, God is more holy, perfect and trustworthy than any other idol. He delivers more, on time, according to His requirements but to our needs. 

> He provides, abundantly, He restores, sufficiently, He teaches us necessity. He loves, profoundly.   
> #composed/lyrics/todo

*11 Whom did you dread and fear,*
*so that you lied,*
*and did not remember me,*
*did not lay it to heart?*
*Have I not held my peace, even for a long time,*
*and you do not fear me?*

The problem of this society and this generation is that it does not fear God anymore. If I say this generation, does it mean the previous one did fear God? In a sense, it feared God more than this one. 
People often speak of the abundance of freedom and indulgence of the seventies, as if we do not have it anymore. Indeed, most people will not have random sex during and undress at concerts—if that ever happened in the seventies. But even in those days it was part of society who did that, mostly young(er) people and those on the liberal side. 
On an absolute scale, however, there are more people now than ever who engage in these sexually immoral activities. Though this does not happen in the open, but almost everyone—or may I say literally everyone—from the far Left up to quite far in the Right engages in sexually immoral activiteit. If we only look at the number of condoms used at the camp of Olympian athletes, during the Olympics. The number of condoms needed was in the tens of thousands (per week, I thought #todo/opzoeken ), while there are perhaps only a thousand athletes—and these are (almost) all strangers to each other! 
Only those who fear God do not follow this pattern. Western civilization is leading this pattern where sexual immorality starts from an ongoing decreasing age and spreads through globalization to the rest of the world. Islamic and Judeo-Christian groups are the only to condemn these practices, however, it is only the latter who practice what they preach—I am speaking of sincere orthodox Jews and real Christians here. 
I am not even half way, I have not even mentioned immorality and criminality, but I will not continue this argument. My point has been made clear. 
Even for the people near the volcano Mount Vesuvius, which has smoking for years, this is a sign to them that it is safe. When the mountain does *not* smoke they should start fearing an eruption. Now God, Who usually speaks to the people with dreams and visions and prophets and miracles, has kept His silence and people do not fear Him. What does this say about the people? #church/material It says they are ignorant, unwilling, or deaf or forgetful, or all of these. 

*12 I will declare your righteousness and your deeds,*
*but they will not profit you.*

Those who worship idols and seek refuge in them, might do righteous deeds as well. God sees that and will declare those things, but they will not profit them. They will not be enough to be saved when they are in trouble. God will not deliver them, because they did not seek Him, and only now, when they are in trouble, they seek Him. 
Is this not a contradiction? Why did God help out the Israelites in the time of the Judges and Kings, even though they worshipped idols as well? 
This is not a contradiction. First of all, this part is written near the end of the period of the Kings. Israel had been taken away by Sennacherib already, and only three hundred years were left before Judah would encounter the same fate by Nebuchadnezzar. 
Second of all, if God says He will not deliver them, it does not mean He will *never* deliver them. Perhaps only in the beginning God will do nothing, just like He did, in fact, for He let the Israelites be in exile and suffer for 70 years. 
Note. I wanted to write "suffer" between quotes, because the Jews had perhaps even a better life in Babylon and Persia than in Israel, during those 70 years, except for some anti-Semitism by Nebuchadnezzar and Darius—which was fairly quickly overcome by Daniel and his friends, through God's grace. 

*13 When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you!*
*The wind will carry them all off,*
*a breath will take them away.*

To some the worst experience with their parents is when their parents are silent. They are angry, but refuse to speak to their child. The child was disobedient, not willing to listen to his parents, and wanted to be on his own. He would not listen to physical punishment, deprivation of his "rights" such as pocket money or playing the computer, and he treated his parents without the due respect the deserve. 
In such as case, would it help to give him another beating, another apprehension #todo/opzoeken correct? 
or rebuke, #todo/opzoeken intrekken
more of his personal rights? I do not think so. Let him be on his own. Do not let him die, give him food and shelter, but that is it. The child will or will not come to his senses, depending on his stubbornness and perseverance of his hardened heart.
In my view God has done the same with Israel. He has been quiet for 400 years between the 400 BC and approximately 3 BC, the time when the coming of Jesus was announced through the angel Gabriel #todo/opzoeken . This is from the time of the exile...
#todo/opzoeken When did Jonah live, when were the Israelites taken captive by the Assyrians and when was Judah taken by the Babylonians? 
God still let the Israelites live, although I am certain that some died by the hands of the Assyrians or in other wars or famine, sickness—the death rate of it increased by immoral sexual behavior (certainly) and overtreding #todo/opzoeken  trespassing? of the ceremonial law of eating *kosher* food (possibly)—or internal strife (by overtreden #todo/opzoeken   the civil law). 
But most of them "lived", although it was not the life God intended for them (cf. John 10:10) or, better said, survived. However, at a certain point God's children would cry out, but God would not listen to them. His children obeyed idols and not their heavenly Father, the Lord `YHWH`. So to prove to His children that these idols are not as holy as He is, He had to let them fail His children. #biblestudy/apologetics
This also is a reason why humans often get hurt. They ask when "innocent" people get hurt, either by "an act of God", such as a storm, earthquake or tsunami, or by human actions such as war: "Why does God not do anything about this?" I would ask them: "Why did you not call on God?"
Most likely, during the tsunami in 2005, the people in Indonesia asked their god Allah, and in India they asked one their million Hindu gods, and in Sri Lanka they asked Buddha. Why did their gods and idols not help them? 
God is angry and rightly so. For hundreds if not thousands of years He has looked on those countries neglecting Him and killing His children, whom He sent as missionaries in the last days to save them. In the Old Testament He sent prophets and those were killed as well. 
Now God is saying: "let your collection of idols deliver you!" Is He wrong to do that? After how many times of warnings is a person allowed to let anyone die? God decides on that, not us. And if God says that He will not save them this time, it is His right to do so. 
Now it was not a wind, but a flood. In America and Haiti it was wind and rain. The words of God spoken through His prophet Isaiah are true. In a different time and context, in a different way, but God is ever unchanging, in His love for His people, for people in general and in His hatred for adultery. 

*But he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land*
*and shall inherit my holy mountain.*

These last two lines of this verse are the exact opposite of the consequences when God turns His face away #todo/opzoeken  negligence is not the right word, nor is nonchalance, for God is extremely sad even when only one person dies, but turns His face the other way to not look at their pain, otherwise He might have a change of heart and help them, as a figure of speech. 
When God is looking upon you, when His face shines upon you (cf. Numbers 6 #todo/opzoeken threefold blessing), then you will be blessed. 
As the people lost their land and their property in the torrents during hurricane Katrina, during the earthquake in Iran and surroundings and during the tsunami in South-East Asia, so God will let those who take refuge in Him possess the land and inherit His holy mountain.
This land will not be a piece of dry land, but it will be fruitful in the broadest sense of the word. There will not only be good soil for vegetative growth and animal farming, but it will soil for innovation, capital, spiritual riches and more. 
Can you imagine how much a country can do if it has limitless supplies of land, money, intellectual capital and resources? It could build hospitals, school, everything. No one would be jobless, everyone would get the job that fits him best. A church would save so much time on investing in people and relations instead of spending time on saving them from starving, housing and education. Churches would not need funding or spend time on that, missions and missionaries would be multiplying all across the nation and to other nations because of all the wealth of a land that has been given by God. 
God has shown the reality of His promise in the land of Israel. Not only its fruitfulness but also its intellectual capital are enormous and most definitely at the top of the charts. The main reason they are not at the top according to worldly standards is because other countries are bigger, such as the United States, and can create a university such as Harvard with the best professors and brightest minds, choosing the best from over 200 million people #todo/opzoeken, among whom many, if not most, are Jews as well (so without the Jews, Harvard would score much less, as any other university would). Another reason are oil fields, precious metals and minerals (although diamonds are not minerals), which make countries such as Saba the richest per capita, but even with free education and low tax rates, it cannot compete with any country on any educational or capital level. 
Yet from a *per capita* (i.e. head count) or per square meter point of view Israel is the richest and smartest nation of all. I would say, even the most moral country, though there still is a lot to improve. 
The reason why they have not always been, is their unfaithfulness to God and His Word. Had they listened to His Word, then there would be no poor people in Israel. Everyone would take care of each other. Marriages would be fine or restored and there would be no children from broken families if everyone read and practiced the Word daily.
Though the latter is not written explicitly in this verse, Isaiah is talking about God's holy mountain. Holiness includes all of the previous paragraph. The land without the holy mountain is worthless. You could have all of the Amazon, Sahara or Russia along with its rich sources, and it would do you no good. But when you have this holy mountain, which is in a desert nonetheless, as a large part of Israel is, the land God gives you will be worth many times more. God can make streams of water in the desert and let food fall from the sky through miracles, but He can use nature and give knowledge to people to show them how to make the land fruitful again. 
It is God Who controls nature. Nature is "everything". Almost every war in history ultimately is about fresh water. Without fresh water we can build machines to create water, but even if there were enough for all 7 billion people and cattle and farms, we would still lack oxygen to live. Without the sun humans would not be able to survive for a month or less #todo/opzoeken 
Without production of oxygen and food, all are from nature, we could not survive. 
But God is willing to give us all of this—nature and knowledge—if we obey Him and follow His holiness. 

**Comfort for the Contrite**
*14 And it shall be said,*
*“Build up, build up, prepare the way,*
*remove every obstruction from my people's way.”*

For people who have sinned more it is more difficult to walk on the road to God than for people who have sinned less. But God intervenes and *makes* it easier for the the contrite. He does not want anything to block those who have sinned for them to come to repentance. God is preparing the way and removing every obstruction so that all—or just His people, the Israelites, I do not know—can at least come to the step where they see their own guilt and take up responsibility for their own actions. God will then provide the next step and revive their heart and spirit. 

*15 For thus says the One who is high and lifted up,*
*who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy:*
*“I dwell in the high and holy place,*
*and also with him who is of a contrite and lowly spirit,*
*to revive the spirit of the lowly,*
*and to revive the heart of the contrite.*

All throughout the Bible we see that God cares for people, and especially listens to those with a contrite and lowly spirit. These people too are not perfect. Rather yet, they cannot be by definition, for they have a contrite heart because of something they did wrong. God cares about our heart and whether we are *willing* to have it changed. On the other hand God cannot change our heart if we are not willing to have it changed, because He will not force Himself on us. 
So to emphasize this: these are two effects. God wants to change those people who are willing to change, and these people happen to be the only people who can be changed. 

*16 For I will not contend forever,*
*nor will I always be angry;*
*for the spirit would grow faint before me,*
*and the breath of life that I made.*

God knows that if He stays angry or even unleashes His full wrath and rage on humanity for only a split second, everything—even heaven and Earth and the whole universe—would blow apart in such a way that matter, space and time would not even exist anymore. He created it in a split second and He can destroy it in less if He wanted to. 

*17 Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry,*
*I struck him; I hid my face and was angry,*
*but he went on backsliding in the way of his own heart.*

God has punished and struck those who did wrong, but it did not help. Still, in the next verse we see that God still helps him. 

*18 I have seen his ways, but I will heal him;*

It is marvelous to see that God sometimes helps those who are not even willing to change, or maybe they are willing but they cannot change, because they have no strength, and not even God's anger and strikes and God hiding His face is enough. Still, though, God helps these people by healing them. 
Their heart is broken, their perception and worldview is broken, their morals and mindset are broken. They might have been indoctrinated or brainwashed into thinking that what is wrong, is right. No fear or any of the above methods can get it out of them. But God can solve it. He can heal the heart. 
I do not know what the decisive factor is, is it the will or the contriteness? It does not say. In the above situation of this person in verse 17, it does not say this person has any change in his heart. 
In any case, God's grace is way above our heads, we cannot understand or fathom any of that, but only pray that we can and learn to be gracious like Him. 

*I will lead him and restore comfort to him and his mourners,*
*19 creating the fruit of the lips.*

I do not understand verse 18 #biblestudy/questions who are "his mourners"? 
But I might understand verse 19. The fruit of the lips are those words of power that people get when they have gone through a period of mourning but comfort from God as well. The things these people say have the power to give comfort to other people as well, they show a little bit of God and His work in the life of the first mourner. 
According to Hebrews 13:15 these words are the sacrifice of praise. What is the greatest testimony that can comfort others? It is when someone who mourns now praises God. Those who mourn and hear this person will wonder how this person could praise God in such dire situations. This is the most powerful testimony coming from words of praise—the same words you and I can say yet not perse with the same effect—but from a person whose lips have grown fruit.

*Peace, peace, to the far and to the near,” says the Lord,*
*“and I will heal him.*
*20 But the wicked are like the tossing sea;*
*for it cannot be quiet,*
*and its waters toss up mire and dirt.*
*21 There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.”*

There are transgressors, those who have sinned, but there are wicked people as well. The difference between the two is that the transgressors know they have sinned and cannot change even though they want to, or they do not want to but realize they cannot change what they because they are inherently bad.
The wicked on the other hand are bad and they want to be. So for there is no difference between the two. The difference is that is that if they were to change to a state where they do have the power to choose between the two options, they would choose to go the wrong way again, because to follow their own way rather than anyone else's. #todo/opzoeken what are the wicked exactly? what is the difference between the wicked and other sinful people? 
Most likely the easiest way to distinguish who the wicked are is by looking at those who want to hurt others on purpose. 
The wicked are those who always want to toss up dirt, never let this dirt sink to the bottom to get clear water. 
Clear water lets you see what is on the other side. In some cases it might even show you clearer what is there, then when you did not have water, if the water works as a lens for example. 
Dirty water cannot be drunk. Stirring up dirt is easily done, but letting it sink takes a long time and much patience. It cannot even be easily filtered unless there is much pressure and a microfilter is used. In other words, whichever way you use, it is going to cost a lot of effort to undo what the wicked person has done.
