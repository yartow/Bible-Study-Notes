# Isaiah 49 (ESV) 
**The Servant of the Lord**
*1 Listen to me, O coastlands,*
*and give attention, you peoples from afar.*
*The Lord called me from the womb,*
*from the body of my mother he named my name.*
*2 He made my mouth like a sharp sword;*
*in the shadow of his hand he hid me;*
*he made me a polished arrow;*
*in his quiver he hid me away.*

Now this part of Isaiah, according to the title of this pericope, focuses on the person of Isaiah, but it addresses the coastlands as well, which are most likely the countries in the north from Syria until Egypt in the south.
Isaiah was created with a mouth like a sharp sword. I can understand that as a prophet it would not have been very effective when one stutters or has any other traits that are not aiding in their oratory or literary activities. But this sharp sword, I believe, is meant more to indicate not the roughness and boldness of his speech, as some can #todo/opzoeken brullen als een beer, but more the intellectual sharpness of it, using irony and cynicism, and wit and mockery. 
But, as I interpret this, God did not use these skills until He had to. It was only until God pulled Isaiah out of His quiver that Isaiah's polishedness #todo/opzoeken was seen. 

*3 And he said to me, “You are my servant,*
*Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”*
*4 But I said, “I have labored in vain;*
*I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;*
*yet surely my right is with the Lord,*
*and my recompense with my God.”*

As for the verse 3 and the first part of verse 4, God is speaking to Israel, but Isaiah is answering Him. If God is speaking to the Netherlands, would you have answered Him? Or would you have said that it does not concern you? Whatever the Netherlands does wrong, even if it is not your fault, would you speak to God as one of the Dutch? 
Isaiah takes this responsibility on Him. By grace He is granted to be an Israelite, and has the #todo/opzoeken  pleasure of living in this beautiful and special land of Israel. 
By grace he has the talent of speaking and perhaps of discipline as well, and he has the unique opportunity to speak to heathens and Jews alike. Most unique is that he has the grace to speak on behalf of God as a prophet and write one of the most important books of the Bible and in effect of history itself.
From the second part of verse 4 on, Isaiah answers—in my interpretation—that all the years he has been working, perhaps for the Lord, perhaps for the world in a secular business, it was in vain. 
If it was for the world, it would have been in vain because Isaiah's purpose would not have been there. If it was for God it would have been in vain, because the timing was not right yet. 
The second interpretation is that Isaiah has worked in vain for the Lord, he has prophesied to people who did not want to listen. But Isaiah has not let down, because he finds his recompense with the Lord.
Perhaps there is another interpretation possible, indicating that Isaiah was working to establish his own success. 
After reading the MacArthur interpretation and explanation of these verses, saying that these verses are referring to Jesus, I realize this means my above interpretations were wrong. However, see my explanation of vv. 5-6.

*5 And now the Lord says,*
*he who formed me from the womb to be his servant,*
*to bring Jacob back to him;*
*and that Israel might be gathered to him—*
*for I am honored in the eyes of the Lord,*
*and my God has become my strength—*
*6 he says:*
*“It is too light a thing that you should be my servant*
*to raise up the tribes of Jacob*
*and to bring back the preserved of Israel;*
*I will make you as a light for the nations,*
*that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”*

It is not entirely wrong to say that these verses are referring to Isaiah. Many, if not all of these, are foreshadows of Jesus Whose Name not coincidentally happens to have the same root as Isaiah's.
Isaiah too was *destined* to be God's servant, as God never does anything without a purpose, and his purpose too was to bring back Israel and even to condemn nations other than Israel—although the part "to the end of the world" does not refer directly to Isaiah's impact, but rather *indirectly*. Through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ for every nation, people from other nations than Israel have read the book of Isaiah and come to Christ, such as the Ethiopian eunuch and even a friend of mine from Sri Lanka. 
And, of course, Isaiah was not a light for the nations—at most he was a reflector of God's light, through the beautiful messages he could tell the peoples in Israel and in the east. 
So the description does fit Isaiah, but it fits Jesus Christ perfectly. 

*7 Thus says the Lord,*
*the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,*
*to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nation,*
*the servant of rulers:*

Would this verse mean that Isaiah too was despised and abhorred? We do not read anything like that in the Bible #todo/opzoeken periode vóór Hezekiah
but we do know that this is true for Jesus. 
I do not understand, however, why the Jews would not see this verse a prophecy for the coming Messiah. Perhaps they do, but then they would know that the Messiah will be a servant, even if a political one. 
If he is abhorred by the nation, then how can he be involved in politics? He would not get a majority of the votes or support from the people. Such a person could never rule or overthrow kings. Even with an iron scepter, like Stalin and Lenin, one would need support from some people at least. The only explanation for such a Messiah is if he overthrows governments in a different way. Not the gates to the city, but the gates to hell he will break down and the gates to our closed and stoned hearts. 

*“Kings shall see and arise;*
*princes, and they shall prostrate themselves;*
*because of the Lord, who is faithful,*
*the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”*

This, however, I have not seen. Which king arose for Jesus Christ? Eventually all kings and princes will, of all ages past, when they stand before His throne, but not during His lifetime. 

**The Restoration of Israel**
*8 Thus says the Lord:*
*“In a time of favor I have answered you;*
*in a day of salvation I have helped you;*

Jesus Himself was not favored, not even by His own Father and "counterpart", the Holy Trinity. Jesus too, as a human being, had to wait to the time of favor, which perhaps occurred at his thirtieth year, or at some moments in His life, just like when we have more or less "luck", which are actually God's favors. 

*I will keep you and give you*
*as a covenant to the people,*
*to establish the land,*
*to apportion the desolate heritages,*

Now here comes the big difference between Isaiah and Jesus: the *covenant* to the people. Isaiah was not a covenant to the people, he was not proof of this covenant nor did he attribute in any way to it, except by broadcasting this message through his book. 
Jesus on the other hand was *given* as a covenant. To me this sounds like he was given as a present or as a sacrifice. A passive verb in which the object cannot do anything but is simply given to someone else, without being asked for his opinion. 
Without Jesus the land could not be established and salvation would not be possible. Not even Abraham, who was saved by faith (cf. Hebrews 11), would have been saved if it were not for the atoning blood of Jesus Christ. 
So why did Jesus come to Earth? The most common answers are 
* to atone for the sins of the Jews and all other nations. 
* to spread the gospel to other nations, so that more people could be saved. 
In general these answers are correct, but one answer is missing—to save more of God's children, the Israelites.
It is not that a small percentage of the Israelites actually had faith in God throughout the ages and were saved, like people from Abraham, Moses, David to Hezekiah and the prophets, and that God thought these were too few to fill up heaven and so He decided to add non-Israelites. It is also that these believing non-Israelites, i.e. Christians, would have a better understanding of the spreading of the gospel and have a special passion for Israel and to spread this gospel to the Jews.
God wanted Israel, its close family through relatives such as the Moabites and Hittites, and far family, such as the Ishmaelites and now the Arabs, to be saved and sometimes, or in this case *perse*, it needs to rely on external people to do this. 
We often have the hardest time forgiving our own family members and refuse to take action or view things in another way. Someone from outside the family needs to step in before we can see the truth. 

Someone needs to tell the truth. Someone from the outside—and these are Christians. 

*9 saying to the prisoners, ‘Come out,’*
*to those who are in darkness, ‘Appear.’*
*They shall feed along the ways;*
*on all bare heights shall be their pasture;*
*10 they shall not hunger or thirst,*
*neither scorching wind nor sun shall strike them,*
*for he who has pity on them will lead them,*
*and by springs of water will guide them.*

Jesus came to save, first the Jews and Israelites and then the Gentiles. This message in verse 9 is meant for all the prisoners, that is both Gentiles and Jews, and verse 10 is meant for all as well, but it does not mean that everyone enjoys these promises. Not everyone takes the invitation or stands on the promise that God made. 
What a promise it is, especially for the time in which this was written, that we would feed along the way. Imagine the roads of Route 66 or other historical routes in America, where for miles there was not a place to eat or sleep, but worse. I do not know the details, but I can imagine it would take days before one would arrive at a location with food and water in Israel in those days. Nothing would grow on trees either in the desert cities such as Masada. 
But the promise is that the whole way will be fruitful, even on the bare heights. 
God has made this promise real for the Jews. Whether there are scorching winds or sun, the present day Jews are using innovatie technologies, given by God, for no other country has it or has perfected it like they have, and use cloths to let the sunlight go through, but keep out the wind. At the same time they have invented drip technology which can water their crops while minimizing water usage. Israel's water use has gone down 10% while the population has grown by 200%.
As for the next line in verse 10, those who pity them, who are they? I think these are Christians. As a matter of fact, Christians are the only people in the world who support Israel, and still only approximately half—or perhaps even less—of all Christians do so.  Even worse, only half of the Jews in Israel support the cause when it comes to Israel versus Palestine. 
Are there any non-Christians who support Israel? #todo/opzoeken 
So those who pity Israel are but a few people in this world, but these are the ones who lead Israel. It was Cyrus in ancient times, and it is the United States at this moment, due to an Israel-friendly president Donald Trump and previously, I would say, other presidents who were friendly to Israel. 

*11 And I will make all my mountains a road,*
*and my highways shall be raised up.*
*12 Behold, these shall come from afar,*
*and behold, these from the north and from the west,*
*and these from the land of Syene.”*
*13 Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth;*
*break forth, O mountains, into singing!*
*For the Lord has comforted his people*
*and will have compassion on his afflicted.*
*14 But Zion said, “The Lord has forsaken me;*
*my Lord has forgotten me.”*
*15 “Can a woman forget her nursing child,*
*that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb?*
*Even these may forget,*
*yet I will not forget you.*

The Lord's love is not like that of a parent or even that of a mother. It is the other way around. It is a mother's love which is like, but not fully like, God's love towards His children. It is the mother's love that God put into mothers and a father's love that He put in fathers. 
Man's love can never be like that of God because His' is so amazing, so great we could not comprehend it. God would have to create other beings than human ones if He wanted us to understand the full scope of His love. 
But God does realize we cannot understand that fully, and so He is merciful to us. Some, however, understand only a fraction of what others understand, because they have been molested and abused by their parents, and in the process have lost a big part of their capacity to receive or give love. 
I have seen though, that no matter how broken the heart is, it can be healed. No matter how shattered, God heals it by giving a new heart that cannot be broken, because this time the heart is dependent not on the parents or on anyone else, but on God directly. 
Because we are humans God created us with human hearts. But He has always wanted us to become spiritual and have spiritual, heavenly, hearts, which we can only have if we choose it ourselves. 

::*16 Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands;*::
::*your walls are continually before me.*::

God continually thinks about us, like one has a tattoo or scar that cannot be wiped out. I do not see directly why God would use the palm of His hands as an analogy. In English the term *back of the hand* is used because that is what man sees all the time, when typing or working for example. 
But reconsidering, the inside of one's hand is only seen when one is carrying something, something precious, something small enough—otherwise the palm cannot be seen anymore, unless it is transparant. That is us! We are on the palm of His hand and God is carrying us "all the time" in as far as time matters to Him. He is looking at us. Not just people, but the whole universe is in His hands.
Our walls, whatever protects us, are continually before Him as well. He cares about the weather, the water and food supply, the money we need to survive and relations. Everything that protects us is upheld by God. He knows what we need and what we might be missing. He sees it and sometimes He does something about it.
What are our walls except for the things above? Our feelings
and our coping behavior, which we *consider* a wall, but which is easily penetrable by the enemy, although the enemy purposely does not penetrate it. First of all because the devil knows it is a wall behind which we *think* we can hide. To the enemy it is a hole in the wall, a security breach which we do not know of. Those are biggest vulnerabilities in life—not the breaches that are visible, because that is where we will put our resources on. 
So in my personal life where I am struggling with pornography and self-worth, the former is a camouflaged hole and the latter something that is openly seen. When I retreat myself to cover up my self-worth I act like I know better than others, to think I am worth more by knowing the answers, by acting tough and by #todo/opzoeken  presteren trying to achieve things, to gain self-worth. Another way of doing that is by belittling other people's self-worth. "*As long as I am worth more than others, then I have confidence"*, is what I usually think. That is perhaps why I act like a *C* when I am in an environment with people who know more than I do, at my secular job, and as a *D*—in the DISC assessment—when I am in a Christian place, because I am more confident of my talents for the Church than for the secular workplace. 
#church/celebraterecovery/pv
My wife, however, sees this behavior and sometimes berates it, reprimanding me and rebuking me in order to correct me and teach me the right way (cf. 2 Timothy 3:16-17). 
My other weakness is not that easily berated. Only my accountability partner knows when I hide behind that wall to feel "safe, comfortable and at a known place", even though I know myself that it is the farthest place from being safe. It is place where sin conceives, breeds and causes death—death in many forms. It causes death in my way of looking at women in general, as objects rather than as humans, with only one goal which is to please men. It causes me to compare my wife with others, first of all, but second of all, I am only comparing her looks with those I am watching. 
I even realized myself when I was doing this, that one of the "stars" I was looking at had really gotten old and I was looking for pictures of her when she was young. How can I compare my real-life wife with someone who "stays" young on the Internet?

**First observation.** The devil sometimes purposely does not enter a hole, so that the hole can grow bigger. When it is small, he can only put a small attack on it, and infect you a little. But when it is bigger, he can cause more damage and even increase the hole in the wall for his next attack, which will come as soon as possible, because he does not want this hole to shrink. 
**Second observation.** If we take the example of a virus entering through our wall of immunity, a virus enters whenever there is a hole. It is like air in a balloon, it seeps out whenever there is a chance. That is a second way of describing the enemy. 
**Third observation.** In our health we think we have several walls, such as getting enough sleep, increasing our resistance by taking vitamin C, increasing our healing factor by taking vitamin D, increasing our growth by taking vitamin A, killing the radicals in our body by taking anti-oxidants, maintaining the "utilities and gear" such as our arteries by not ingesting the wrong fats, and our organs by not eating too much poison like alcohol and sugar. 
These are, in fact, not separate walls. We live in an illusion that if one wall breaks we still have other walls. This makes us become more careless when it comes to the maintenance of one wall. Some like to eat sugar and "fix" this by doing more exercise. The truth is, however, that all of these measures are linked together to one single thing: *resistance*.
All of these measures are like separate components of a wall, the steel, the brick, the mortar, the components and quality of the mortar and bricks, the foundation, the technique with which it is built, etc. One weak spot in the process will allow for penetration with the right technique, and the devil is smart enough to know which technique to use. 
This illusion is what keeps us down. It is what keeps me down. I am trying to stay strong, holding up my walls, by reading the Bible, Bible memorization, studying Scripture (though that has become rare in the last years), practically exercising everything of the H.A.B.I.T.S.—the other two are tithing and accountability)—adding  stewardship and the Daniel Plan to it, to keep my body healthy—but it has not been enough to save me from my problem with pornography.

Dear Lord, I know You have my walls before You, and You see that there are breaches in my wall, weaknesses which I cannot or do not see—let alone know how or be able to repair. But You can! You know what is wrong with my life, what is lacking. What characteristic of the fruit of the Holy Spirit spirit am I lacking, which command am I disobeying, is it Micha 6:8, one of the Ten Commandments, am I not rebuking anyone who needs to be rebuking? Let me know, Lord!

*17 Your builders make haste;* 
 #biblestudy/questions who are these builders?
*your destroyers and those who laid you waste go out from you.*
*18 Lift up your eyes around and see;*
*they all gather, they come to you.*
*As I live, declares the Lord,*
*you shall put them all on as an ornament;*
*you shall bind them on as a bride does.*

What greater proof is there of God's victory and His presence and workings when the ones who destroyed us, gather around us and praise us, or repent or in any case have changed 180 degrees into one supporting and respecting us? Some movies show this aspect—as all movies are at least partly based on real life—such as *Wrong Bet* when everyone who betted against Jean-Claude Van Damme saw his efforts to win the battle and in the end were rooting *for* him. 

*19 “Surely your waste and your desolate places*
*and your devastated land—*
*surely now you will be too narrow for your inhabitants,*
*and those who swallowed you up will be far away.*

Not only will it be that, but the portions with which God blesses us—as always—are magnificent. It would be something like an all you can eat, so much that we cannot contain. He has more love for us than our hearts can hold, more grace than we could ever forfeit. 
Now, God is saying that this almost literally decimated people of Israel, or perhaps even more than decimated since ten of its twelve tribes were cast over vast areas #todo/opzoeken  verspreid, verbannen
and of the remaining two tribes perhaps a tenth was taken to Babylon and only 25% of that tenth returned. I do not know the numbers, but this is what I estimate from what I hear and read, in the Bible and elsewhere. 
So this severely decimated people will inhabit Israel and it will be too narrow. Of course assuming the land has not shrunk this would mean that the number of people would. 
Has this happened in real life? 
Yes and no. The country *has* shrunk. As a matter of fact they lost the whole country after 70 AD, but if this promise was meant for 400 BC, perhaps the country remained the same size. However, at the time they returned the population was not that dense yet. But if this promise was meant for current Israel, then this promise might be seen in the light of the shrunk Israel, where the east part of Israel, I think it is the tribe of Dan and Caleb who lived there, which has now been given to Jordan, and a part of the west strip, the Gaza strip, which has now been given to Palestinians. 
Secondly, aside from that a lot of the Israelites returned from their diaspora. If all Jews all over the world returned to Israel it would get a bit fuller, but not enough to overfill the desolate places. 
Thirdly, Israel has a lot of other ethnicities. Many people from Babylon and Persia perhaps as well inhabited Israel in 400 BC. Currently there a lot of Palestinians. But still, this does not fill up all of Israel. 
Then fourthly, the places where life is possible, provided there is water nearby, those perhaps have reached their limits. As mentioned earlier in this chapter (I think) it is only through innovations in technology that the Israelites can survive together with everyone living in their country. Not many more could live there without depleting the water from the Jordan river and with that the destruction of what is left of the Dead Sea—at least not unless the country of Jordan uses these technologies as sparingly as the Israelites do.
Either way, the end of the end-times have not appeared yet and God Who keeps His promises. He has either fulfilled this promise already but we do not know the interpretation, or He will fulfill it on His time.

*20 The children of your bereavement*
*will yet say in your ears:*
*The place is too narrow for me;*
*make room for me to dwell in.’*
*21 Then you will say in your heart:*
*‘Who has borne me these?*
*I was bereaved and barren,*
*exiled and put away,*
*but who has brought up these?*
*Behold, I was left alone;*
*from where have these come?’”*

[~Note that the Dutch SV has a different interpretation/translation of this text and is talking about the literal children that have been bereaved from the parents, instead of about the children of bereavement.~
~The KJV on the other hand translates this as Israel's new children, after they have been bereaved of their previous ones, of which the result is more similar to my interpretation below, i.e. Israel will grow to be big again—but it is still a different interpretation.~
~MacArthur adds to this in his notes that Christians are part of these children and this promise as well, at least those who support Israel. In that case the promise is literally fulfilled and Israel would be full.~] 
How does bereavement, that is grief or the loss of loved ones, have children? The children mentioned here are—in my perspective—the consequence of this bereavement. What happens to one when he is bereaved? He becomes sad, perhaps bitter and loses passion for life or anything in it. These have consequences on his job and his #todo/opzoeken  prestaties in it.
But not for Israel this time. The bereavement has occurred already, they lost at least a part of their fellow Israelites—I assume at least some Jews have opposed the conquest of Nebuchadnezzar and that the latter must have killed some of those opposing him; They also got bereaved of their land and their king, their homes, perhaps separated from their families to never see them again and what not more? But there is no space for the consequences of that. When God says *enough* it really is enough and the consequences they have carried, sadness and bitterness, in the seventy years will be sufficient. 
No more children of their bereavement will be born. That in itself is a promise and a gift. We always think of what we *receive* as a gift, but more often it is what we do *not* receive which is the gift. Are we grateful for the lack of bereavement we have in our life? It could have been worse, it always could be. 
The "writer" says accurately
> *but who has brought up these?*  
> *Behold, I was left alone;*  
> *from where have these come?’”*  
He correctly asked himself *who withheld* this bereavement from him, instead of asking *why* any bereavement is happening to him. 

*22 Thus says the Lord God:*
*“Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations,*
*and raise my signal to the peoples;*--
*and they shall bring your sons in their arms,*
*and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.*
*23 Kings shall be your foster fathers,*
*and their queens your nursing mothers.*

If we still assume that all of this is written in the context of the children of Israel, which are the Christians as well, then I do not understand why the peoples bring sons or children to Israel. The many Christians that are right now have not been brought forth by other peoples, but it was the Jews in the first place who went out and spread the Gospel, it was not that peoples brought their children over. 
But if this is about actual Jewish people, then too there are some discrepancies with this text. Granted, the Jewish people have been carried in ships during Word War II or perhaps before that #todo/opzoeken/history in ships all across the oceans but no country would accept the Jewish refugees. I cannot say that is "carrying on their shoulders", it was more like dumping them and getting rid of them. 
So I am still waiting for that moment that the world will be grateful for Jews and let them return to Israel and that Jews themselves will be happily and voluntarily return to Israel.
But what would it mean then that kings will be *your*, that is the Jews', foster fathers. If these kings are the fathers of our children, then should these kings not be on our level? Instead, they have become *our* foster parents as well. 
And what is the meaning of "their queens". Does "their" refer to the kings' queens? Should this not be the kings' wives? For a king's queen would be one of a previous generation, above him, his king's wife that is. But I shall assume for now a king's queen is his wife and that that was the way of writing things. 
Let me assume that these foster fathers and mothers are called this way because they took care of the Jews. Still the question remains, when did this happen? #biblestudy/questions

*With their faces to the ground they shall bow down to you,*
*and lick the dust of your feet.*
*Then you will know that I am the Lord;*
*those who wait for me shall not be put to shame.”*

If your enemies bow down to you and lick the dust of your feet then indeed you will that God is the Lord, for no one could establish such a thing. The Israelites or the Jews', in this case, greatest enemies, the Muslims, would never bow down to Jews or to Jesus Christ and reject Mohammed as their prophet, the greatest prophet and as a prophet in general—they had rather kill themselves than to do that. 
To accomplish such a thing, the hearts of the enemies must change, and we all know that this cannot be done by man—one cannot even change his own heart, only God can change hearts. 
Note, however, that in the last line God addresses the aspect of patience, to *wait* for Him. This implies that it requires some time before God acts and fulfills His promise. Note as well that He says that those who wait will *not* be put to shame. So whatever you are experiencing right now is not a shame. It might be shameful in the eyes of the world, but it is not in the eyes of God. The fact that the Jews lost a war, many in fact, that Israel is boycotted by most countries and people in the West, and that we as Christians are ridiculed for believing and adhering to moral standards given by God is *not* shameful in the eyes of God. Rather yet, it is bravery; The gentleness expressed by Christian martyrs is awe striking in the eyes of Christians, and in the eyes of God as well. 

*24 Can the prey be taken from the mighty,*
*or the captives of a tyrant be rescued?*
*25 For thus says the Lord:*
*“Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken,*
*and the prey of the tyrant be rescued,*
*for I will contend with those who contend with you,*
*and I will save your children.*
*26 I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh,*
*and they shall be drunk with their own blood as with wine.*
*Then all flesh shall know*
*that I am the Lord your Savior,*
*and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”*

The question in verse 24 is rhetorical, but the answer is not a "no" but a "yes". God can of course save anybody from whomever He wills. What I now understand, is why God contends with our oppressors. Contending is a form of suffering. Our oppressors are suffering because they have been put up with us. We, or the Jews in this case, were probably not the easiest type of people to deal with either. They ate only what was kosher and wanted strict Laws such as the Sabbath. Perhaps they even kept these Laws when they were taken captive and put on the market for active labor. Perhaps they refused to work on Saturdays and eat non kosher food. Their owners, if they were slaves, could not neglect them, otherwise they would die of hunger or at least have bad prestations #todo/opzoeken  prestaties because of their lack of food and nutrients and letting them die would be a loss of their own property.
But those who *did* contend with them, who held up with them, and treated them fairly and just, they too would find contendment #todo/opzoeken  from God. As mentioned in verse 26, our oppressors will be dealt with, they will eat their own flesh, like the Israelites have eaten their own children during the time of Joram. But those who contended with the Jews would find contendment from God and not suffer this same fate. #todo/opzoeken which were those? The Persians? Is that the only example?
