# Isaiah 1
#biblestudy/devotionals/isaiah

*The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.*

***A Rebellious Nation***

*Hear me, you heavens! Listen, earth!*
*For the Lord has spoken:*
*“I reared children and brought them up,*
*but they have rebelled against me.*
*The ox knows its master,*
*the donkey its owner’s manger,*
*but Israel does not know,*
*my people do not understand. ”*

*Woe to the sinful nation,*
*a people whose guilt is great,*
*a brood of evildoers,*
*children given to corruption!*
*They have forsaken the Lord;*
*they have spurned the Holy One of Israel*
*and turned their backs on him.*

*Why should you be beaten anymore?*
*Why do you persist in rebellion?*
*Your whole head is injured,*
*your whole heart afflicted.*
*From the sole of your foot to the top of your head*
*there is no soundness —*
*only wounds and welts*
*and open sores,*
*not cleansed or bandaged*
*or soothed with olive oil.*
*Your country is desolate,*
*your cities burned with fire;*
*your fields are being stripped by foreigners*
*right before you,*
*laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.*
*Daughter Zion is left*
*like a shelter in a vineyard,*
*like a hut in a cucumber field,*
*like a city under siege.*
*Unless the Lord Almighty*
*had left us some survivors,*
*we would have become like Sodom,*
*we would have been like Gomorrah.*

Not only the Israelites, but we too, Christians and all other human beings, are like the Israelites described above. We are stubborn, even more stubborn than donkeys and cows. At least then will walk, when beaten though, but we will not listen, even if we are on the brink of death. 
In this case, many others have already died and still we do not listen. This is true not only for the evolution-creation story, where people are trying to think of many alternatives just to circumvent the version where God plays a role, but also is it true for psychology and a healthy relation between man and woman, and food that is healthy. They do lots of research just to find out that the Bible has already said the same thing (more than) 2000 years ago. Science would be a lot easier to start with the hypothesis that the Bible is true. 

*Hear the word of the Lord,*
*you rulers of Sodom;*
*listen to the instruction of our God,*
*you people of Gomorrah!*

Though we are children of God, we can be so stubborn that He calls us by our enemies' names. 

*“The multitude of your sacrifices—*
*what are they to me?” says the Lord.*
*“I have more than enough of burnt offerings,*
*of rams and the fat of fattened animals;*
*I have no pleasure*
*in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.*

There is a line that when we cross it, even the things that used to bring God pleasure, will not only not please Him anymore, but He will even hate it. Beyond this line, the only that matters is sincerity. 

*When you come to appear before me,*
*who has asked this of you,*
*this trampling of my courts?*
*Stop bringing meaningless offerings!*
*Your incense is detestable to me.*
*New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations —*
*I cannot bear your worthless assemblies.*
*Your New Moon feasts and your appointed festivals*
*I hate with all my being.*
*They have become a burden to me;*
*I am weary of bearing them.*

Even the great feasts which are celebrated in memory of the ancient Israelites are to be stopped. God even tells the people not to have the celebrations anymore that He initiated, because they are not sincere in heart and come to these feasts with wrong motives. 
It is like a person who proudly built himself a big house, or his own car from scratch, but now, because it reminds him of bad things, the does not even want the car anymore. 

*When you spread out your hands in prayer,*
*I hide my eyes from you;*
*even when you offer many prayers,*
*I am not listening.*
*Your hands are full of blood!*

Things that the Lord hates:
* The feasts above
* robbery for burnt offering (61:8), 
* serving other gods (Jer. 44:4), 
* harboring evil against a neighbor and love for a false oath (Zech. 8:16),
* divorce (Mal. 2:16), and 
* the one who loves violence (Ps. 11:5).

The reason why God hates are different in each case, but there is a red line through it, which is not respecting the fellowman or not respecting God Himself. 

*Wash and make yourselves clean.*
*Take your evil deeds out of my sight;*
*stop doing wrong.*
*Learn to do right; seek justice.*
*Defend the oppressed.*
*Take up the cause of the fatherless;*
*plead the case of the widow.*

Above is a short list of good things. It all comes to this: *just do it*. Do not go protest or talk about things, but take care especially of those who are oppressed, such as the fatherless and the widow. 
In my situation there is a kid in church who does not have a father. I would have liked for him to join us in games, but he does not always want to. Perhaps because of insecurity, but I found out, when he lost a game, that he has a bad temper or is bad at losing. This makes him repulsive, unattractive to be helped. But it is exactly what he needs to become a man. Perhaps I am exactly what he needs, because I am a man.

*“Come now, let us settle the matter,”*
*says the Lord.*
*“Though your sins are like scarlet,*
*they shall be as white as snow;*
*though they are red as crimson,*
*they shall be like wool.*
*If you are willing and obedient,*
*you will eat the good things of the land;*
*but if you resist and rebel,*
*you will be devoured by the sword.”*
*For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.*

This verse has become so famous and cited so frequently that it will lose its meaning if I read passed it. But unlike a secular quote, this is Biblical, and there is one thing for sure: the Bible lives. This means that God will speak to me through this verse each time I read it.
Today, God reminds me to be good and obedient. That is a difficult thing, even if the last two days have gone by with little temptation for either sexual sin or any other disobedience towards God, every day is always a new day. 
Dear Lord, help me to stay faithful to You today as well. I know I cannot do that, that I am not *able* to do that on my own. I need the power of Your Holy Spirit to help me go through the day, to be a good employee at work and a good husband at home, a good co-worker for the meeting I have tonight with others from church—to keep my temper, be careful with my judgment and arguments. 

*See how the faithful city*
*has become a prostitute!*
*She once was full of justice;*
*righteousness used to dwell in her—*
*but now murderers!*
*Your silver has become dross,*
*your choice wine is diluted with water.*
*Your rulers are rebels,*
*partners with thieves;*
*they all love bribes*
*and chase after gifts.*

#tags/politics I cannot help but think about the United States when I read this part, although I am really aware that this is not about the United States, but about Jerusalem. Maybe it is possible to know what happened with Israel by looking at the history of the United States, although it is not certain how the division came to be there either. There have always been people wanting to make money out of others, and those who have wanted to do the right thing. Now the former, I would say these are the Democrats, have conquered the tools to influence next generations—education, news and Hollywood—and the "good" party is losing her children to the Democrats, as well as the rest of the world who is led by America. 
If this is true, then there have always been greedy people among the Israelites. Though the events in the Exodus for which the Israelites were punished were not out of greed, but out of a lack of faith in God, greed does play a role in the rest of Old Testament history, especially when God calls out to the Israelites through prophets like Isaiah and Amos to stop worshipping idols, amongst which Baal and Mammon, or in other words, fertility (sex) and money. 

*They do not defend the cause of the fatherless;*
*the widow’s case does not come before them.*
*Therefore the Lord, the Lord Almighty,*
*the Mighty One of Israel, declares:*
*“Ah! I will vent my wrath on my foes*
*and avenge myself on my enemies.*
*I will turn my hand against you;*

Again, it is about the poor man or woman here that God cares, and what all of this wrath of God is about. If anyone—even an Israelite—hurts or does not take care of an Israelite in trouble, he will be punished for it. Israelites themselves can then even be called "God's enemies" if they do not obey Him, the Almighty God.

*I will thoroughly purge away your dross*
*and remove all your impurities.*
*I will restore your leaders as in days of old,*
*your rulers as at the beginning.*
*Afterward you will be called*
*the City of Righteousness,*
*the Faithful City. ”*

But there is good news, even if in the form of purging. God will clean us and restore us. And not only us, but our country and leaders as well. There is hope, however it may hurt the many, and in the current situation—both in Israel as well as in the United States—it unfortunately is the majority that is going to be purged.
But the hope is there, that the Bible will be the constitution of the New Israel, most certainly in on the New Earth, but perhaps on the current Earth as well, and that even a country that has gone as far off as the United States can go back to its roots, at least to the *intention* with which the Constitution was created. 

*Zion will be delivered with justice,*
*her penitent ones with righteousness.*
*But rebels and sinners will both be broken,*
*and those who forsake the Lord will perish.*

Eventually God will save Jerusalem, and all of Israel with it and He will do it with justice. This means that there will be people punished. 
This too, the liberals, the so-called progressives, will oppose, for they are convinced that corporal punishment, let alone capital punishment, is prohibited and unnecessary *in this age*. 
What they fail to see, is that God is a god of all ages. He thought it was right to punish people thousands of years ago, right now, and He will do so in the future as well. They also fail to see that God is a patient God and that He waits far longer than we ever do before he strikes a person down. Another thing is that God knows everything, even the future. This means He knows whether a person will change or not, and He knows the person's heart and intentions. 
God is in His own right to punish whoever and however He wants. Above all, He is sovereign. That alone should silence all arguments. 

*“You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks*
*in which you have delighted;*
*you will be disgraced because of the gardens*
*that you have chosen.*

As above, I am not only writing this with the former Israelites in mind, but with the present ones in 2017 as well, and mostly the people of the United States. People of both countries have become secular. There are now not only secular Jews, but also secular Christians—if that is a term at all—meaning they cannot be distinguished by their actions to be what they claim. 
They are "delighted" in all the wrong choices, abortion, gay marriage and divorce. They are Godless, but not godless. They still have their god, but it is money, fame and wealth. Status and power, sex and enjoyment, these are their goals now. Thinking only short term, without wisdom, without the moral instructions from the Bible but only those rationalized from their own intellect, which is so limited compared to the vast knowledge and experience that God has, of which He has put some in the Bible. 
If only they would take that knowledge and add further moral rules on top of that, like the founding fathers did. Now they are not only making up rules, they are breaking down America as well. 

*You will be like an oak with fading leaves,*
*like a garden without water.*
*The mighty man will become tinder*
*and his work a spark;*
*both will burn together,*
*with no one to quench the fire. ”*

Once again, it is good to hear that God *is* doing something about it. In all ages we see that God rules in the end. He does not always act immediately, because He is patient and wants to give men time to change. Even though He knows that some will not change, He knows these persons will sin more instead. And waiting for that gives God all the more right to punish these people even more. 
For example, if God were to kill a person at age 25, because He already knows that he will never turn to God, then He can only punish him for the sins he has committed until age 25. But if He lets him live until 80, He can punish Him for all of his sins up till 80. 
Is God so keen on punishing a man? No, but small punishments will not change the world. Big ones, like the flood, Babel and the events during the Exodus will show the world God exists and is to praised as the One and only Mighty One of Israel. 

Now these people, worshipping all kinds of things, except God, they will see that their source runs dry. Their gods will not give them hope. The money will not give them pleasure, their policies will not bring the fruit they had wished, such as Obamacare to relieve the poor and Affirmative Action to fight racism. 
Rather yet, it will be their own work that will destroy them. Man himself will become like tinder, highly inflammable; and his work will be the spark, not a fire, but enough to set off a revolution. 
Man's work, in this case perhaps documents and ideas and policies, will be the spark of the actual result, which is poverty, sickness, broken families and disputes, due to an economic downfall, free sex and no love and tolerance for their fellowmen. 
Take for example abortion, if it is allowed it causes two things: a reduction of the number of people, but most of all, a decrease in morality. The latter leads to approval of abortions up to even the last minute, so long as they do not breathe. Maybe even, if this goes further, it will be allowed to abort children, as long as they are under three years old. Psychologically they will find some "proof" that children under any age are incapable of actually living the way we think is "living".
