# Isaiah 44 (ESV)
**Israel the Lord's Chosen**
*1 “But now hear, O Jacob my servant,*
*Israel whom I have chosen!*
::*2 Thus says the Lord who made you,*::
::*who formed you from the womb and will help you:*::
::*Fear not, O Jacob my servant,*::
::*Jeshurun whom I have chosen.*::

We do not have to fear, for it is the Lord Who formed us in the womb. If He had wanted to hurt us, He would have done so there. Even more so, He would not even have let us be in the womb! 
No, He made us, let us be born and grow up to what we are right now because He loves us. Not only is He our Father and does He love us like a father, but also is our Master, like a master takes care of His servant. Why should we fear our Master? He is a good master. If He were discontent with us He could have hired another servant any time, but He did not. So that means that He has given us another chance. And we can trust in Him that He will provide us with what we need to grow. 

*3 For I will pour water on the thirsty land,*
*and streams on the dry ground;*
*I will pour my Spirit upon your offspring,*
*and my blessing on your descendants.*
*4 They shall spring up among the grass*
*like willows by flowing streams.*

The land is thirsty because it has not had water to drink for years. This kind of earth has dried up so much that it cannot even absorb the water it is given. Only a top layer will become wet but the rest underneath it will not. Merely through the cracks some water will seep. 
Yet if there is not a one-time plunge of water but rather a stream, then the ground has the *time* it needs to absorb the water. The water will not flow over the ground, but it will be absorbed into the ground ::filmpje van Earth BBC, over woestijn die helemaal nat wordt na een regen, omdat de grond het water in het begin niet absorbeert.::
So it is with us and with the Israelites. They had been dry ever since King David passed away. Every now and then they received some refreshment with a good king arose, only 7  or 13 times out of 20 kings, and only in Judah, i.e. the southern kingdom. 
Israel needed a big portion of God's Spirit, not a one-time portion but a stream of living water, a continuous connection with God's Spirit. We know that that was not possible, because God's Spirit cannot live in a sinful person. Only by the grace of God it was possible that God's Spirit lived *temporarily* in Simson and in David, as we see in the story of Simson that the Spirit came upon him and left him later on #todo/opzoeken, just like it did in Saul's life #todo/opzoeken  exact vers, and even David asks God not to remove His Spirit from Him after he had sinned (cf. Psalm 51). 
The *stream* of water, this *continuous* connection with the Holy Spirit has only been made possible by the incarnation of Jesus Christ, Who credited us with His righteousness, so that we have been justified and made. In other words, we have become sinless. All of our past sins have been nailed on the cross and all of our future sins will skip us and go directly to the cross, because everything has been paid for *in advance*!
This holiness allows us to obtain this continuous connection, to absorb the Holy Spirit so that His power may seep into our hearts, through the cracks at the surface. 
Yes, we have some superficial cracks, these moments where we are willing to say a little bit our inner selves, to show a little bit of our hidden person. But it is only a small crack, one might say, in our metaphorical mask behind which we hide, through which not even a glimpse of our whole face can be seen. 
But even through these small cracks, God can work miracles. His Spirit goes where nothing has been before and because God has made our hearts, He knows how it is woven and spun. He knows the way to our hearts and inside our hearts to the core of the heart even better than we know it. #church/material

*5 This one will say, ‘I am the Lord's,’*
*another will call on the name of Jacob,*
*and another will write on his hand, ‘The Lord's,’*
*and name himself by the name of Israel.”*

It seems to me that this is a prediction of the different people there are who believe in God at this moment. The first one are Christians, saying that they are the Lord's, referring to both the Lord Jesus and the Lord their God. The most distinctive feature being that they say they *are His'* #todo/opzoeken  with apostrophe?
I am in doubt as to whether the orthodox Jews are within this group, but they certainly are in the second group, because they descended from Jacob and call upon their forefathers. I am leaving out the Pharisees and other sects because they are not truly believers of God in the context of these verses. 
The third group will not say it, but they will write it on their hands. In a sense this is more explicit and radical, because once it is tattooed it can "never" be removed again. On the other hand, it does not mean that they live by it—although one who says it does not have to either. They too will call themselves by the name of Israel, which is Jacob. These are the secular Jews, who will always by genes be children of Israel, and in God's heart they are well, but who still need to decide to choose for God.
In short, I think these three groups refer (implicitly) to Christians, orthodox Jews and secular Jews, respectively.

In the context of this book of Isaiah, this would mean something else, namely that people will call on God's name again someday, not separated by their origin. 

**Besides Me There Is No God**
*6 Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel*
*and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts:*
*“I am the first and I am the last;*
*besides me there is no god.*
*7 Who is like me? Let him proclaim it.*

This is what both God the Father and Jesus Christ, His Son, are saying. As a matter of fact, this is another proof that Jesus Christ is in the Old Testament, although to be honest, it does not say here that this Redeemer is Jesus Christ, although the whole Old Testament does refer to this Redeemer. 
It is the same redeemer of which Boaz is a foreshadow, the redeemer who would #todo/opzoeken  break the skull of the snake
and many other references to it. 
This Redeemer is claiming to be God Himself, which is why both the Lord *and* His Redeemer are saying "besides *me* there is no god". Even though this parts has the word "me" in it, the subject consists of two persons, the Lord and His Redeemer, but the use of the verb "to say" is singular ("says"), which means they are one Person. 
God is saying here explicitly there is no god, with a small "g". There are not even smaller gods. There is only one and He is the first and the last! Better yet, there is not even one who is *like* Him. If there is one, let him—this "god"—proclaim it. 
Have there been any in this world? No. The mormons have their own god, in the form of an alien, but they do not proclaim it. Only internally will they speak of it, but that is not proclaiming. Buddhists do not have a god yet merely enlightened ones, but the Chinese made them into a god with powers. They are, however, not proclaiming that these buddhas are like our God and that they are the only gods and that no other god is stronger. No one makes a claim as this, except our God. 
No one claims to be the first and the last, except the Muslims, but they are supposedly referring to our God and have some misconceptions about it. 
Let us face the facts: there *is* no other god. If there were, he would have claimed his rights or punished our God for bragging about something that is not true. 

*Let him declare and set it before me,*
*since I appointed an ancient people.*
*Let them declare what is to come, and what will happen.*

God does not stand by and wait. If there is anyone who wants to brag about his powers, let him do so, provide the proof, the proof of being the first for example. But God has put in place an ancient people, the Israelites. They can declare that their father Abraham was descended from the father of all people, Noah, and that in those times there were no other gods. Perhaps there were before the Flood, but not afterwards, unless his sons came up with it immediately. 

*8 Fear not, nor be afraid;*
*have I not told you from of old and declared it?*
*And you are my witnesses!*
*Is there a God besides me?*
*There is no Rock; I know not any.”*

There is no Rock, no foundation any other than God Himself. That is why we do not have to be afraid. No one is stronger than God and no one can hurt us besides Him, and He will not hurt us. 

**The Folly of Idolatry**
*9 All who fashion idols are nothing, and the things they delight in do not profit.*

As human beings we are *something*, but as soon as we fashion idols we become *nothing*. Not only are we then worshipping the devil himself, dressed in a different suit, be it the ancient gods of the Middle East like Mammon, Baal, Astarte, or Nordic ancient or modern gods, or Greek gods or one of the five major world religions except for the God of the Jews and Christians, but the things they are doing from then on are worth nothing. 
What do idols (or the devil) delight in? In murder, death, disease, theft etc. These do not profit. Surely, God allows some of these at times and uses these to fulfill His purpose, but in of themselves these things do not make any profit. They do not make their worshippers better either? Those who worship them are made fools in front of everyone. The 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of Asherah, who went against the Holiest Lord, that is our Mighty God, made a fool out of themselves when they could not get the sacrifice on the altar burning. Eventually it even cost them their lives. ~Speaking of no profit, here there was not even a prophet!~ #quotes/church Not only did they not receive a profit, they actually had to pay the price with their lives. 

*Their witnesses neither see nor know, that they may be put to shame.*

God shames these idols on purpose. Only He can get the honor. If there are witnesses who say they have seen any of the aforementioned gods, then this is at the cost of the credibility of the witnesses of God Himself. Therefore, no witnesses will exist, these idol worshippers will neither see nor hear and the idols will be put to shame for even trying to rob God of His honor. 

*10 Who fashions a god or casts an idol that is profitable for nothing? 11 Behold, all his companions shall be put to shame, and the craftsmen are only human. Let them all assemble, let them stand forth. They shall be terrified; they shall be put to shame together.*

Now it is turn for the craftsmen to be put to shame, those who *created* the idols. They are fools for they are spending their time on something that is worth nothing. The only profit they will only get out of it the sale of this statue. 
God will not only let the lack of profits be their punishment. No, He will put them on trial and they will be ashamed for what they have done, for providing idols to the people. 

*12 The ironsmith takes a cutting tool and works it over the coals. He fashions it with hammers and works it with his strong arm. He becomes hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water and is faint.*

In this verse and in the verses below the craftsmen do not realize that everything they do is because of God's power. The irony is that without God they could not even create other gods. 
The ironsmith becomes hungry. Not only food is the source of strength, but God is the main source upholding everything. 

*13 The carpenter stretches a line; he marks it out with a pencil. He shapes it with planes and marks it with a compass. He shapes it into the figure of a man, with the beauty of a man, to dwell in a house.*

Who has created beauty? Who has made man as perfect as he is? The renaissance art shows (again) how beautiful man was created and how he would be like if there were no sin, muscular and of perfect proportions. Man's body (and that of women as well) are visualized in Leonardo Da Vinci's painting of the Vitruvian Man. It is not coincidence that God created the human being in exactly four portions—from toe to knee, to hips, nipples and top of the head—four being the Biblical number indicating Earthly things.
Man's navel is the center of him, it is through which he was fed, even before he was born. 
The beauty of man and nature has all been created by God. 

*14 He cuts down cedars, or he chooses a cypress tree or an oak and lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. He plants a cedar and the rain nourishes it. 15 Then it becomes fuel for a man. He takes a part of it and warms himself; he kindles a fire and bakes bread. Also he makes a god and worships it; he makes it an idol and falls down before it.*

Again God shows how good he is to us and how we repay Him with sin. Trees could not grow without God. We water them and put them in good soil. Actually, we do not even have to water them, because the rain does that for us. But how does growth work? How does life spring from a dead seed? This seems to happen automatically. 
Man can say he understands how it works, how root will appear that suck up the water which in turn grows new roots and a stem, but it all happens through what is written in the DNA of that plant. *Someone* must have designed it—that One being God of course. 
But again, God made trees for man. He foreknew that man would get cold and that trees could be used as fuel, to keep him warm but also to let him cook his food on it. Not only to kill bacteria but also to make food taste better. (See also the text in Isaiah 43 about God's plan for our enjoyment of this world.)

*16 Half of it he burns in the fire. Over the half he eats meat; he roasts it and is satisfied. Also he warms himself and says, “Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire!” 17 And the rest of it he makes into a god, his idol, and falls down to it and worships it. He prays to it and says, “Deliver me, for you are my god!”*

So this is what God has given us through trees: food, warmth, hygiene, satisfaction. We use the wood and the fruit for these things, but what do we do with the rest? We "thank" God by creating an idol. Not even an idol of Him, but of some lower god who has some attributes of creation such as fertility, wealth or some powers or elements of nature. Then we sacrifice the things God has given us, for *our* enjoyment, for this idol! We sacrifice animals and fruit for idols. 
Now this happens in a lot of religions, but better known examples of fruit sacrifices are Buddhism and Hinduism, meat sacrifices are still done in Islam. If you happen not to be in any of those religions you might say that these verses do not apply to you, but everyone has an idol or God. If you do not have God as your god then something else is your god, perhaps yourself. Who is your master? The one who decides what you are allowed to do—and in many cases that is the person himself—that is your master. 
In verse 17, however, there is another requirement for an idol. The worshipper must think that this idol can save him. So in that case, some people commit suicide because they think no one help them or give them the satisfaction they need. They thought it was drugs or partying or friends that could give them pleasure and in fact they were calling out the same words "deliver me!" For they wanted to be delivered from this empty feeling. They asked drugs or whatever to deliver them, but nothing could satisfy them. 
At the moment of their suicide or as soon as they gave up that any material thing could deliver them, they were actually delivered from this false idea, from this worship of idols. That state of mind, no matter how depressed they are, is in fact a better state of mind than when they had put their hopes in an idol. But it is of no good to them if they stay there. If they start looking from there for another god, one who is real, they might encounter the real God. I am saying "might" because I am not sure if everyone will, even though the Bible says that whoever calls upon the Lord ... [will be saved?]  #todo/opzoeken On the other hand, if they start looking, that means they have already been chosen. 
On the other hand, if they stop looking then they will not find their way of hope, which is Jesus Christ, and eventually their only way out is to step out of their lives. 

*18 They know not, nor do they discern, for he has shut their eyes, so that they cannot see, and their hearts, so that they cannot understand. 19 No one considers, nor is there knowledge or discernment to say, “Half of it I burned in the fire; I also baked bread on its coals; I roasted meat and have eaten. And shall I make the rest of it an abomination? Shall I fall down before a block of wood?”*

The humans who worship idols have fallen to such a deep place that God does not "bother" anymore—if I may say that—to save them. Perhaps they did have senses, but they gave into their evil desires, so He let them do so. They wanted to bow before a block of wood, so He let them do it. 
God also closed their eyes and hearts. The cannot see the consequences of their actions. They cannot see what is happening with their lives. They do not know what is good anymore. 
Look at Chinese people, for example, who bow down for or worship idols of either Buddha or forefathers. Their lust has always been to protect themselves and elevate themselves in status and materialism. This has taken such proportions that they are willing to give up their moral values and worship idols who can give them these things. The Chinese are so afraid of not having the honor of a wealthy life that they force their children to go to school and get the highest grades, even at the cost of their children's emotional and social health—and often at the cost of physical health as well. 
They are so willing to achieve this that they have already put this in their minds at the highest place. When the Communists came and ordered the one-child policy, the Chinese (women) were already prepared for this—mentally and morally—to sacrifice their child, should it be a daughter, to benefit from it themselves. 
Let us be honest here. Even though the parents gives everything he has to his child to provide him with education, food and, to a lesser extent, physical, social and emotional health, ultimately it is all so that the parent himself can be proud, can boast and show off, live wealthy and safely, without worries about the future. It is purely selfish and out of a fear to have no honor. 
Giving in to this selfishness and fear, they have rejected God, even before knowing Him, because all the things God wants the Chinese to give up, are exactly the things they care about: wealth, a safety and certainty dependent on wealth or people, self-centeredness. 
So if #todo/opzoeken  bij voorbaat 
they are not willing to give up these things, then God lets them stay blind, for they were blind already. They had eyes, but they did not open or use them. If they are not going to use their eyes and heart anyway, then God might as well close them. 

*20 He feeds on ashes; a deluded heart has led him astray, and he cannot deliver himself or say, “Is there not a lie in my right hand?”*

They are so blinded that they worship a statue which cannot even save himself from the fire. 

**The Lord Redeems Israel**
*21 Remember these things, O Jacob,*
*and Israel, for you are my servant;*
*I formed you; you are my servant;*
*O Israel, you will not be forgotten by me.*

We will not be forgotten by God, ever. But will we remember Him? He is commanding us here to remember it. Yes, *commanding*. Remembering is not something we can do automatically, we need to work for it. We need to practice it. 

Why does God want us to remember it? For two reasons, the first one is because we are his servants and because we are created by Him. That is why we should listen to Him. Included in this reason are the many good things a master does for his servant. It is only logical that a servant should remember those, just like any person should remember the ones who have helped them in the past. That is a part of gratitude. 
The second reason is because we should not ever worry about our transgressions, because God already says here that He has blotted them out and *redeemed* us. 
What does redeem mean? It is like saying "I have already bought that for you".  So to us it means we have been saved. To God it means He had to pay something for it. These are two extra things to remember. First, we do not need to worry about forgiveness, for God has already given us that, or about the payments of our debts, because God has already paid that. Second, God has paid that with His *life*, hurting Him more than any human being has been able to feel pain, but slightly comparable to losing your own son.

*22 I have blotted out your transgressions like a cloud*
*and your sins like mist;*
*return to me, for I have redeemed you.*

Clouds disappear. With enough they dissipate. They cannot be grabbed and when you're close up, you cannot even see the cloud. All they do is fog your eyesight. Clouds can only be seen from a distance and when it is cold. 
Our transgressions are many—many more than we are aware of and of a much higher severity than we realize, if we were aware of it to begin with. Our sins are only for those transgressions of which we realize they are wrong. 
Our sins are visible to us, they are like a fog, a mist, and it is all around above and beneath us. We cannot see clearly because of our sins, but we do get stained by it. Perhaps slightly, but we do get wet. 
How good is it to know that our sins are but mist, because God blotted them out. Mist is all that remains. Before God blotted it out our sins were like chains—heavy, controlling our movements, leaving marks on our skin and keeping us in the dungeon. But mist is so much more of a relief. 
Mist still has an effect, just like sin does. We need to bear the consequences. But we must realize that these consequences are ever so slight, *only* because God paid for this redemption by shackling Himself with these chains—which He broke again though when He rose to life. 

*23 Sing, O heavens, for the Lord has done it;*
*shout, O depths of the earth;*
*break forth into singing, O mountains,*
*O forest, and every tree in it!*
*For the Lord has redeemed Jacob,*
*and will be glorified in Israel.*

Whenever we hear the rustling of leaves, it is not simply the wind moving the leaves. Whenever we hear the cobbling of water, it is not simply the water touching the river beds. 
No, it is much more than that. It is an outcry of glory to God the highest King of the World. It is an exclamation of worship and praise for what the Lord Almighty has done. 
He is the Lord YHWH and has redeemed Jacob. An impossible task for everyone but God, to save but a severely disobedient people, but He has done this physically and in the New Testament He will do that spiritually. 
The Lord put to action the powers in the world, rulers of Babylon, Assyria, Neo-Babylon, Persia—and many others, in order to establish the reign of the Romans and Herod the Great over Israel, but until the moment of release only these empires—though all by their own *free will*, and punished every enemy of Israel and the Israelites. God avenged His own people, He redeemed them and He will be glorified in Israel. 
Everything in nature has been put to action in the same way. The butterfly effect is a theory which explains how the effect of wingstroke of a butterfly ultimately has effect on a tornado. In physics and biology this is in theory possible and possibly true. Yet in the same way, God uses His created Earth and its nature to glorify Him. He lets the mountains, waters and plants make sounds or movements. He controls when something happens. All the volcano eruptions are exactly timed and fully under control of God, even though the natural laws of physics are fully at play. 
God perhaps caused a strong east wind when Moses crossed the Red Sea—aside from the fact that no wind could ever hold or split the water of the sea, unless it would blow away the people as well—but even this wind, which is only a theory claimed by some, I believe, can be backtracked into its natural coming of existence. 
What I mean by that, is that this wind was created in exactly the same way as other winds are created. [#todo  Add an explanation of how marvelous the process is of how wind is created...somewhere the sun shone and heated up some place, which caused ....]
God "simply" made sure that Moses saw the burning bush at the right time and spoke with the pharaoh, [#todo still to add etc.] so that by the time they arrived at the Red Sea the wind coincidentally nearly at its strongest point. 
Again though, that is *if* the wind were the main factor in there. 

God will be glorified much less than He should be, though. All of nature will glorify Him as much as they can, but not His own people. So many of the Israelites (from the north) do not know God anymore or even know they are an Israelite and they have been spread across the world. So many of the Jews in the south have not returned from their abolishment #todo/opzoeken  right word? 
to Babylon and Persia. How many are left at all? 
The devil is doing a "good" job here, especially after dispersing the Jews in 70 AD during the Jewish War after he killed most #todo/opzoeken how many? 
of them. 
But God is faithful, He kept His covenant with the Jews, those who still believed in God, and He made His covenant with Christians as well—not to *replace* the former covenant but to *aid* it. It is through Christians and Christianity that Israel has always been known as the promised land of the Israelites and thus for the Jews in the south as well. This has been made *common* knowledge because the Bible taught it and throughout the West the Bible was in fact taught almost everywhere.
It is because of this inherently Christian belief that Israel belongs to the Jews—aside from the historical *proof* from literature and architecture in and around Israel—that the NATO decided, apart from a likely feeling of guilt after WWII, to *return* Israel to the Jews—*return*, that is, not *give*.

[because so many Israelites and Jews have not returned from Babylon and Assyria #todo/opzoeken  where are they?]

*24 Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer,*
*who formed you from the womb:*
*“I am the Lord, who made all things,*
*who alone stretched out the heavens,*
*who spread out the earth by myself,*

The Lord has created the greatest work ever in history: He created history itself. He created time and with it history, and He created the world. Not only the planets and the heavens (atmospherical layers, plural) on this planet, but also the controversial third heaven "above the waters", written somewhere in the Bible #todo/opzoeken  waar?
which is a heaven "around" the whole universe, *outside* of the universe.
He made such a big thing, but at the same time He made us in the womb as well. No even before that He created the design of how we would look in our DNA and our character (partially) in our soul. Our souls too have been designed. 
#todo/opzoeken  knit into my soul, waar in de Bijbel?
Just look at the perfect distribution of people with a specific DISC profile. The number of people needed with a specific DISC profile to run this world, are exactly distributed according to this distribution. Is that not a coincidence? How could evolution cause different characters and profiles? How could evolution cause the need for it? The people who do not get selected do not die out of the gene pool. So there would be an overload of S-profiles. 
And later, after designing, He *formed* us as well. God is not working like the theists think. God does not create and then let it replicate. He designs, creates, forms and shapes it into the model He wants it to be. Like a true artisan, he will be there from the conception to the end product. 

~*25 who frustrates the signs of liars*~
~*and makes fools of diviners,*~
*who turns wise men back*
*and makes their knowledge foolish,*

I cannot help but think of the Left here again. The Left is an almost perfect description of everything that that God detests. The Left is lying about abortion and that abortion has enabled women to work which has added 3 trillion to the American economy. No, it did not. If those women had used anti-conception abortions would not have been necessary. If those unmarried women did not have pre-marital sex, this would not be necessary. 
It makes them fools, to think it is good and a right to cut a living thing out of their own body, which hurts, costs money, damages your body and decreases the odds of ever having another baby, damages your emotional health and only adds to the guilt and shame these women have—not the guilt imposed on them by others, but guilt they should have for sinning against God, which comes from the Law written on their hearts.
The wise men of this world, supposedly the leaders of their countries or the leaders, such as Justin Trudeau or the leaders of the UK or France, of certain groups even, such as Jimmy Kimmel and perhaps especially women such as Whoopi Goldberg, who have many viewers, who all denounce America of the current Trump administration, will be shown they are wrong. The nations leaders are implementing their own policies concerning health care and immigration. The first leading to huge costs for the government, where people are forced to pay for others, and for themselves for things they do not want—in effect breaking down the economy. 
The second is an influx of immigrants which for a big part consists of people who are not capable of working, making use of social security and health care due to bad morals with respect to work discipline and bad health, due to their lifestyle (Mexican and black people tend to eat less healthy than Americans, even though Americans are not healthy eaters either, but compared to Europeans the difference is much greater). 
In short, anything these leaders deem wise, is only bringing their country at a greater risk of defaulting financially, and anything these leaders of people (such as talkshow hosts) are proclaiming is only getting people into a deeper moral deficiency. 

*26 who confirms the word of his servant*
*and ~fulfills the counsel of his messengers~,* #biblestudy/questions
*who says of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be inhabited,’*
*and of the cities of Judah, ‘They shall be built,*
*and I will raise up their ruins’;*
*27 who says to the deep, ‘Be dry;*
*I will dry up your rivers’;*

His servants, those who obey Him, God will confirm. His servants will not randomly say things that dishonor God or that are not true, but they will be led by His Holy Spirit and say what the Holy Spirit tells them to say. So if their servants say, through a strong faith in God in their hearts, that God will save them, then God will confirm this word. For it is God in the first place who sent this word to His servant, and when His servant has said it and others do not believe God, God will confirm it to show others that His Word is true. 
I do not understand "the counsel of his messengers" though. Do his messengers have a counsel? If He is talking about angels, do angels gather together to have a meeting? And if they do and they actually *counsel*, that is give advice, then would God fulfill that? 
If I suppose this counsel consists of humans and they gather together, like elders in a church, to give advice on what is right. They propose a new law against abortion for example, or against euthanasia, then would God fulfill this counsel? 
In churches we must trust the elders that they have used their love and knowledge for God and for His people to come up with the best solution. But I can think of many examples where elders were not as loving or wise or knowledgeable. Would God fulfill counsel from these men (or even women)? 
They would not be God's messengers if they did not fulfill the criteria. So if this verse only applies to people who are actually God's messengers, such as Cyrus in the next verse, or king David or Samuel, of whom we can say in hindsight that they really were, then yes, God fulfills the counsel of *His* messengers because it is He Who sent them in the first place to bring a message of what He was going to fulfill. 
But the reason why God has to confirm this message and fulfill it is because these messages are miraculous. God is doing things that no one will believe. God will restore not only the land of Israel but the whole world as well. He will not only bring the Jews back out of slavery or captivity from Babylon, He will bring all of the world, captive by sin, into freedom through the coming Messiah. To prove that, and that is what His messengers are saying, He will show some "small" things first, shown in verses 26 and 27. He will rebuild the land of Israel and let rivers run dry by a simple command. 

*28 who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd,*
*and he shall fulfill all my purpose’;*
*saying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’*
*and of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.’”*

Even Cyrus, a non-Jew and pagan or former pagan, who perhaps believed in God, whether he believed in His existence or actually followed him I do not know, but he could be considered one of the messengers in the previous verse, and even a servant of God, for God confirmed his word and fulfilled what he gave as counsel. 
Cyrus said that Jerusalem shall be rebuilt, and according to verse 28 #todo/opzoeken  which I still need to read myself in the books of Ezra and Nehemia, that the foundation of the temple shall be laid and God made it happen. Not because Cyrus said it, but because God Himself said, through this man, Cyrus, confirming that what Cyrus said was indeed from God.
