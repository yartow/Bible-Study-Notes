# Isaiah 28
#biblestudy/devotionals/isaiah

**Woe to the Leaders of Ephraim and Judah**
*1 Woe to that wreath, the pride of Ephraim’s drunkards,*
*to the fading flower, his glorious beauty,*
*set on the head of a fertile valley —*
*to that city, the pride of those laid low by wine!*
*2 See, the Lord has one who is powerful and strong.*
*Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind,*
*like a driving rain and a flooding downpour,*
*he will throw it forcefully to the ground.*

Beauty in our eyes does not mean anything in God's eyes. Even though He created beauty, even though He can see the outward beauty of some people, of buildings, city and of nature, of organizational structures, to Him it is nothing if there is no obedience to His Word. He will destroy it all over a contrite heart. 
To Him, the Almighty, beauty is created in a millisecond through His spoken Word. 

*3 That wreath, the pride of Ephraim’s drunkards,*
*will be trampled underfoot.*
*4 That fading flower, his glorious beauty,*
*set on the head of a fertile valley,*
*will be like figs ripe before harvest—*
*as soon as people see them and take them in hand,*
*they swallow them.*

A wreath of flowers, meant to be the crown of winners and victors, of freshness and beauty, for not every flower is suited to be inserted in a wreath, has faded or was never beautiful to begin with. To man, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and when man decides to choose his wreath with this premise, most surely wrong flowers are going to be picked. 
Of course, this is true of our government as well. The people of our land can choose whomever they deem fit for government. Some choose character, others choose decisions on causes they would support themselves, such as abortion and euthanasia. But who chooses on the basis of what God finds fit for purpose, defined by a strong man and leader according to His Word?
But when the wrong people are chosen for government, they will be swallowed and trampled. Sometimes by the people themselves. They will find out that the consequences of their decisions have tremendous disasters. Sometimes this will happen by God’s intervention—of course anything that happens in the world is by God’s will. 
Take for example black people’s votes in the United States. Black people tend to vote more for Democrats, because they seem like they do more for minorities. Democrats are *for* Affirmative Action, government subsidized abortions, especially for minorities and *against* immigrations—of course to get their respective votes. Little do black know the true reason for this. Democrats are killing two birds with one stone. First, they are getting votes, second, they are getting rid of black people and other minorities through legal methods and paid for by tax money. Currently more black babies are being aborted than are born in the state of New York! Most Planned Parenthood facilities are in minority neighborhoods. 
It will probably be too late when black people discover this. Half or more of a whole generation will have been killed by then and Democrats will have gained a lot of power. By then, and most unfortunately *only* by then, will black people swallow up the Democratic party and blame them for lying to them. 
The Democratic party will meet its downfall, as God has promised in Deuteronomy 32:35:
> Vengeance is mine, I will repay. In due time their foot will slip.   
> Their day of disaster is near, and their doom rushes upon them.   

*5 In that day the Lord Almighty*
*will be a glorious crown,*
*a beautiful wreath*
*for the remnant of his people.*
*6 He will be a spirit of justice*
*to the one who sits in judgment,*
*a source of strength*
*to those who turn back the battle at the gate.*

But the Lord Almighty, He will be and stay and has always been a glorious crown of beautiful flowers. Though people have seen God as a terrible ruler, a dictator, a director of a movie where we are actors or extras, poorly treated and only living for God’s pleasure—we were all wrong. God’s guidance and directing of this world’s events has all been for our *good*! It has been to benefit us, to set us free from the curse of sin and death (cf. Romans 8:1) and to give us an abundant life (John10:10). 
God alone is our King and should always have been our One and only King. We rejected Him, we rejected the prophets and quenched the Spirit (1 Thessalonians 5:19, see also Stephen’s speech to the council),
#todo/opzoeken  “council”, official name? Where in Acts? 
the Jews wanted to choose our own king back then and right now we want to choose our own President (as for the United States) and our government everywhere else. 
Look at what it has brought to us? The number of believing people are drastically declining in every country. Where is it growing? In China, Africa and India. In the former two the government was not chosen—I do not know about the latter. Perhaps South-Korea (and Japan as well? #todo/opzoeken Rising number of Christians in the world) is an exception in the democratic world where governments are chosen by the people, but everywhere else it is declining. 
This is not deduced from the declining church attendance rate, because those statistics probably never meant anything. Real faith is not shown by attendance, but a declining attendance rate is a symptom the health of our faith. 

*7 And these also stagger from wine*
*and reel from beer:*
*Priests and prophets stagger from beer*
*and are befuddled with wine;*
*they reel from beer,*
*they stagger when seeing visions,*
*they stumble when rendering decisions.*
*8 All the tables are covered with vomit*
*and there is not a spot without filth.*
*9 “Who is it he is trying to teach?*
*To whom is he explaining his message?*
*To children weaned from their milk,*
*to those just taken from the breast?*

The wreath of people, chosen by the people, are drunkards. In the ancient times they were so and they still are. How much alcohol is going around in campaign funding events or in politics in general? How much have Kim Jong-Sun, Jong-Il and his son, Jong-Un, been drinking, eating, partying and binging on porn? Perhaps the North-Korean leaders are bad examples, because they were not chosen. But it is the result of what a man really is like when he is set free from most of the worldly—and spiritual, for that matter—bondages.
This means that the men chosen to be in our governments are just as bad, potentially. They are merely restricted in their behavior. When they are not restricted, they start drinking and getting drunk as their predecessors did, the former kings of Europe, czars of Russia, emperors of the Roman kingdom as well as those of the Middle-East and Asia. Granted, the Muslim rulers probably did not drink alcohol, but were just as abusive as the rest, abusing women, sex, power and food.
How can a group of such people—that is, not only men, for women would have likewise bad behavior—lead the people, let alone teach them? It is not academic knowledge that the people need, they need to be taught moral values. 
But it is a vicious circle. And another circle connected to it, because it seems like I am repeating myself. It all comes to the same point. How can a people with a lack of morals choose the right people to teach them these morals? They can not. 
Only God can choose and send those men (or women) to lead them, like He did in the time of the judges. And the people are only willing to accept these judges when they are at their wits’ end, desperately crying for help. 
So I am afraid that this still needs to happen, and will happen soon. 
[see also the millennials? Those are the children just taken from the breast]

*10 For it is:*
*Do this, do that,*
*a rule for this, a rule for that;*
*a little here, a little there. ”*

All these leaders can say is to do this or that. And that exactly is what our European government has been doing. It is like driving a bicycle for the first time, going to the left and then to the right, keeping adjusting the steering wheel without a purpose, only to compensate for the wrong that has been done in the precious action. Rules are made, because that is easier than changing the previous rule. 
After so many years they still do not realize that that is all they have been doing. Instead of setting a course towards fulfilling God’s purpose, they are merely doing what the people want and correcting the previous ruler’s wrongdoings, or making them worse by one’s own longings. 

*11 Very well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues*
*God will speak to this people,*

If this applies to Christians today, this would probably mean that the Christians in the Western world are all about statutes, whereas we see that Christianity in underground China and India as well as other places throughout Asia and the Middle-East—which are also part of the underground and persecuted Church—are much less structured in the sense that they let God lead them. In one sense we can see an evolution from the orthodox church to the catholic ones, a small change in flexibility, and then from Reformed to Baptist, Seventh Adventist and to Evangelical ones, progressing in flexibility. 
Though statutes still exist in the more “evolved” denominations, a great deal is achieved through prayer for God’s guidance. This is not enough though. And God says that if we do not want to listen, we will have to look at how “foreign” Christians, such as those of the countries and areas of the world mentioned above, are led by God and take an example from them. 
The Discipleship Making Movement (DMM) is one of those movements that arose in India (or in England—I am not sure if Mike Breen was first or followed after) where we “do away”—so to speak—with the rules.

*12 to whom he said,*
*“This is the resting place, let the weary rest”;*
*and, “This is the place of repose”—*
*but they would not listen.*
*13 So then, the word of the Lord to them will become:*
*Do this, do that,*
*a rule for this, a rule for that;*
*a little here, a little there —*
*so that as they go they will fall backward;*
*they will be injured and snared and captured.*

The Lord has said many a time to trust and abide in His Word. Rest in His promises and do not try to fix things yourself. Realize that God has all the answers, why should we then not listen to Him and let Him handle things? Or at least ask God for directions and then use His directions to solve matters?
If we do not, then the Lord will let us be. If we want fixed rules—instead of flexibility, that is dynamic guidance, based on the circumstances—then we will get rules and this is what we have got: rules. Those rules have captured us. 
While we created these rules to keep control of our society—while God never meant us to do this, as mentioned above, we should trust in Him and take His rules, instead of making our own (cf. Mark 7)—these rules backfired and made sure we cannot even go into action when we want to (through veto restrictions for example in the NATO) or laws that cannot be removed and can only be added to, which makes the practice of laws almost impossible, only possible for someone with a law degree and even worse, one will win lawsuits on the base of knowledge of the law, instead of on being morally right. 

*14 Therefore hear the word of the Lord, you scoffers*
*who rule this people in Jerusalem.*
*15 You boast, “We have entered into a covenant with death,*
*with the realm of the dead we have made an agreement.*
*When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by,*
*it cannot touch us,*
*for we have made a lie our refuge*
*and falsehood our hiding place. ”*

It is a big mistake to make a deal with the devil, also known as the father of all lies. Some make a deal with him and trade in their soul for wealth, status and fame. Some pop stars, and especially rock stars, have shown this to be almost a fact. They worship the devil by worshipping everything that is against the Law of God. Bands such as *Mötley Crue*, *the Red Hot Chili Peppers* and *Nirvana* promote free sex, drugs and living life on the edge without respect for others or for anything for that matter, only for themselves. 
Out of those groups mentioned above, only Kurt Cobain has committed suicide, unable to handle the downside of the deal—the other side of the coin. The rest is just hanging on, but they know themselves that they have caught the short end of the straw, although they might be too proud to admit it. 
Why would the father of all lies not lie straight into your face when he says he has a deal for you? A deal that will make you happy and rich? He lies about the duration—Kurt Cobain was only 27 years old when he passed away—he lies about riches—all of the above are fairly rich, but are not truly rich in their hearts. In short, the devil has lied to them about what true happiness was and that he could provide it. 
The Democrats, unfortunately, believe in this same lie. They are hiding behind a lie but the truth is unfolding. Some are paying right now with short term imprisonments, but when the truth has fully unfolded, larger debt will have to be paid. Lives will be lost. 
As surely as God lives, justice and righteousness will occur—for all the deaths that have taken place through abortion, racism and corruption. 

*16 So this is what the Sovereign Lord says:*
::*“See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone,*::
::*a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation;*::
::*the one who relies on it*::
::*will never be stricken with panic.*:: #biblestudy/memorization/todo
*17 I will make justice the measuring line*
*and righteousness the plumb line;*

As powerful as the Democrats are right now, or the Left wing is, or Social Justice Warriors (SJWs), or in short, everyone who is not a Christian, God only has to do one thing to fix it all: draw a line. He will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line. #personal/family/familytime/done Leuk idee om met een loodlijn te werken en dan te weten dat alleen wat recht is, geschiedt. Kartonnen schijf die kan draaien over één punt. Touw met gewicht eraan. 
There is only one line and there are no (other) objectives. It is not a maximization of winning souls, like in a debate or in a vote, or a pastoral conversation, where one has to be careful with one’s words and have a good balance between love and the light (i.e. the law). No, God just draws a line and either you are on the right of it or on the left. 
Everyone will be on the left, for all have sinned, but only a small part is redeemed through the righteousness of Jesus Christ’s blood.
This line, and this righteousness, are both brought forth through one stone, the Cornerstone which symbolically resembles Christ. Jesus Christ alone can set the line between what is righteousness as He showed it Himself on Earth. 
Now it must be understood that righteousness or any other [term….] #todo/opzoeken  hoe wordt zo’n woord genoemd, niet ideologie, niet grootheid, maar ... [algemeen motief, value?] 
is independent of whether man is able to achieve or show that in practice. But God Jesus showed it anyway. In a certain way He is saying: “The life I have lived here on Earth, is the epitome of righteousness.” If anyone can achieve that, he has obtained righteousness. In other words, Jesus has set the bar. 

At the same time Jesus is the foundation upon which we can build and lose our fear. Whereas so many are afraid of this value i.e. righteousness, which leads them to hell if they have not enough of it—even though many do not even believe in a hell, they still have anxieties and angst—Christians can rest in peace despite knowing far more certain than their counterparts (i.e. non-believers) that hell exists, precisely *because* of the existence of Christ.
Christians are so certain of their salvation that they are willing to die. 
They are certain that hell exists, but they also know that hell will not be part of their destination. They know that Christ is stronger than hell, that He has conquered it, that Christ holds Himself to His promises and that His blood is enough to atone for our unrighteousness. #todo/opzoeken  this is a good way to test whether people are saved or not
Unlike the protagonist Kenshin in the manga series *Samurai X*—or *Rurouni Kenshin* in Japanese—who was constantly on a journey to find ways to atone for the people he has killed, including his own wife (though by accident), Christians can rest assured that the unrighteousness done to Christ, or in other words His blood, is enough to cover our transgressions which led to our sins and unrighteousness. 

*hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie,*
*and water will overflow your hiding place.*
*18 Your covenant with death will be annulled;*
*your agreement with the realm of the dead will not stand.*
*When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by,*
*you will be beaten down by it.*
*19 As often as it comes it will carry you away;*
*morning after morning, by day and by night,*
*it will sweep through.”*

The Left trusts in lies. Deep down inside their hearts—for some, for others it is on the surface—they know they are wrong. They know that it is their party that is using violence against the right, restricting freedom of speech. 
And whether they agree with the Constitution or not, they know they are going against the Second Amendment #tags/politics/amendments/second, i.e. to defend oneself (with arms). 
Their facade is slowly exposing itself to be a lie. Though the Left may still be pro-choice—that is, for abortion—Planned Parenthood (PP), which is a symbol of that, is crumbling away under the facts that have shown that PP has been illegally selling baby body parts, and perhaps a lot of other things. 
Now the people to which pro-choice is the most important right, more important even than the right of someone else to live—those people, in fact, are the type of people who will use violence, because they only care about themselves and only their opinions matter—will still support PP, because of their view on abortion. They do not care whether it is legal or not. 
People like Dave Ruben on the other hand, who are more rational and care not only about the feelings of the Left but about all people, has already left the Left party and is more inclined towards the center. I am wondering whether he will eventually end up at the right, because the Right eventually is the party that wants to conserve the Constitutional rights of everybody. 
My contention is that when everyone knows the facts and understands these, and their heart is on the right place, like Dave Ruben’s, they will be somewhere on the Right. 

In any case, this verse is telling that the hail will come, the water will come, morning will come and it will all turn out to be a lie. Just like the pop and rock stars have found out that the devil with whom they signed a contract is a chronic liar, so the people supporting the Left will find out that the Democratic Party is as well. Bit by bit this kingdom of theirs will fall apart and expose itself to be a facade of evil. Every goal was either money or power, driven by selfishness—although Obama’s goal was the destruction of the United States, yet through his selfish goal of colonialism.

*The understanding of this message*
*will bring sheer terror.*
*20 The bed is too short to stretch out on,*
*the blanket too narrow to wrap around you.*
*21 The Lord will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim,*
*he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon —*
*to do his work, his strange work,*
*and perform his task, his alien task.*

Democrats are in terror right now, as we speak, on March 7th, 2018. A terror so bad they do now know what to do. Isaiah describes this phenomonon with such a beautiful metaphor of a bed that is too short and a blanket that is too narrow, which is very frustrating to say the least. It takes hours for me to fall asleep when I have such blankets and I will wake up in the middle of the night trying to fix the blankets. 
They are in this great terror because of the Truth, that is, the truth that many Republicans that are finding out and speaking of, such as Ben Shapiro, Dinesh D’Souza, Ann Coulter and many more of whom I do not know the names. 
Even Democrats are coming out and telling the truth about what is happening there. Though only reading headlines, even Condoleezza Rice, former Secretary of State, is [supportive of] gun rights and condemning [some comments] #todo/opzoeken what did she say
—just to name one. 
Is this happening on the Republican side as well? Perhaps, I do not know, because I do not watch their channels, news or their videos, but I doubt it. Because a truth stays a truth, there is nothing conflicting between the truth and morals. It is like the Truth (of God) is +1, when multiplying it with other +1s, it stays 1. But everything of the devil is -1, and when continuouly multiplying it, it becomes positive and then negative and so on. There is no certainty there. 

*22 Now stop your mocking,*
*or your chains will become heavier;*
*the Lord, the Lord Almighty, has told me*
*of the destruction decreed against the whole land.*
*23 Listen and hear my voice;*
*pay attention and hear what I say.*
*24 When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually?*
*Does he keep on breaking up and working the soil?*
*25 When he has leveled the surface,*
*does he not sow caraway and scatter cumin?*
*Does he not plant wheat in its place,*
*barley in its plot,*
*and spelt in its field?*
*26 His God instructs him*
*and teaches him the right way.*
*27 Caraway is not threshed with a sledge,*
*nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over cumin;*
*caraway is beaten out with a rod,*
*and cumin with a stick.*
*28 Grain must be ground to make bread;*
*so one does not go on threshing it forever.*
*The wheels of a threshing cart may be rolled over it,*
*but one does not use horses to grind grain.*
*29 All this also comes from the Lord Almighty,*
*whose plan is wonderful,*
*whose wisdom is magnificent.*

The main goal, seemingly, of this piece is that God has a way He will deal with all nations. Every nation and every person are different, and they need different ways to be motivated—and in some situations perhaps even coerced—to obey God. Yes, God knows every button of every person and people. His wisdom is magnificent. 
But the part before this coercion is the plowing.

Plowing, the breaking up of land, will not take place continually. At one point the farmer will see that it is broken up enough for the seeds to fall in deep enough to grow root. And then, after the harvest, each type of wheat is treated differently. Threshing and grinding are done in different ways.
But plowing is needed, before sowing and all that comes after can take place. It is a symbol of God breaking the hearts of people. God needs to break the hearts of all people, because they are not listening and because they need to be punished. Why? Because the seed of His Word can otherwise not enter the soil of their hearts.
Very important is the word “continually”, this means that God is faithful to His Word. He will punish a person for the transgressions he has done, He is righteous and will give what one deserves. So the plowing will come to an end. 
It this related to hell as well? Will the punishment there come to an end as well? We see that *in this case* plowing serves a double purpose. The first one is as a means of punishment, the second one is to prepare the person for the next phase, to receive God’s Word (again). This of course implies that God is gracious enough to give this person another chance, for some do not receive this chance and are not plowed, but are killed—in some events even literally instantaneously (see the story of Achan in the Old Testament and the couple lying about their givings in the New Testament). 
Yet in hell people do not get a second chance. So could the punishment there be seen as plowing?
