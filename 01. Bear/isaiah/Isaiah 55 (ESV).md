# Isaiah 55 (ESV)
**The Compassion of the Lord**
*1 “Come, everyone who thirsts,*
*come to the waters;*
*and he who has no money,*
*come, buy and eat!*
*Come, buy wine and milk*
*without money and without price.*

God is offering this gift to everyone to two type of people: those who thirst and those who have no money. I presume the latter are also thirsty and hungry because they have no money, and that God is putting an extra emphasis on His compassion with the weak and poor by repeating the first line, but only for the poor ones. 
Being thirsty, as with many if not all of the adverbs in the Beatitudes, is a trait you cannot force yourself to. One cannot force himself to be thirsty, or to be meek or have a broken heart (poor in spirit). Just like in Celebrate Recovery people come on their own initiative when they have reached rock bottom, when they have become thirsty without water to quench their thirst or people to help them. 
You do not have to wonder whether you are eligible to get this wine and milk for free, that is whether you are thirsty. First of all, when you are at the stage where your "body" needs water, you will *feel* it. Second of all, if you were not thirsty, you could still force yourself to drink water.  However, in the case of spiritual thirst, one would never come to God out of one's own initiative—people are too proud for that. We cannot simply *decide* to follow God and get what He has to offer. We need to drop to the bottom of a pit with only one way left to go. Only then can we make the "choice" to go up—even though that is not an actual choice because there was only one way. Some, however, choose to stay there and die.

God tells us to buy, even those without money. God does not desire money, He desires our hearts. #todo/opzoeken  Somewhere in the Bible this is written. Those who are at the stage that they are finally willing to give up themselves to God must have a broken heart. It is with our broken heart and soul that we pay for these blessings of milk and wine. Just like David wrote in Psalm 51 #todo/opzoeken  that a broken heart you will not contrite...
The first attribute of this milk and wine, this blessing, is that it is not paid for with money, although it is not for free. One can only ask with a broken heart. The second attribute is that it is price-less. Not only is it priceless in the sense that its value cannot be measured, like peace of heart, hope and joy, but also it is priceless in the sense that it is not possible to set a price for those who want to buy it, even a price in terms of broken hearts. God does not say that your heart needs to be broken at least 85% before this wine will give you blessing or be effective. Even if God said that He needs but one broken heart to sell this, it is still an amount and hence a price. 
I think the reason for this lack of price is that how much you pay for it is how much you will get from it. Those who come with their broken hearts can have their hearts fully restored, no matter how broken it is. But if one comes with a fully broken heart and only gives 10% of his heart to God, then only this 10%, or less—because issues of the heart are usually connected to other parts and one part cannot heal unless the other is healed as well—will be healed. 

If you think about it, it takes an awful lot of time and effort just to get a little bit of milk and wine. It takes an enormous amount of water, especially in hot countries where water evaporates even quicker, to let grapes grow, even when the ranks #todo/opzoeken  already exist. 
A big amount of these grapes will be, I expect, not ripe enough, too small, too sour, or eaten by pests and animals. 
Then the harvesting needs to be done with great care. For those not grapes ripe enough the farmer will have to go a second time to harvest them. 
The rest of the process of turning these grapes into wine is something I will not describe here, but one can imagine that it is tedious work. 
As for milk, one can only think of the amounts of water needed to water the grass, the time it takes for cows to grow to fertility, getting pregnant, bearing a calve and after that regularly milking the cow. And that is for but one cow only. How much milk is that? #todo/opzoeken 

*2 Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread,*
*and your labor for that which does not satisfy?*
*Listen diligently to me, and eat what is good,*
*and delight yourselves in rich food.*

This verse exactly describes the way of living in the 21st century and it probably was this way in the 21st century BC as well. God never intended us to have this kind of life. 
We spend our money, not on things to let us survive, but on things to gratify our lust and desires. 
We buy goods, not because we need them, but because we want status and others to envy us—like cars and houses. We do not buy stuff because we want to grow and become healthy—like food—but because we want to bulk up, lose weight and become more beautiful so that we can be like others. 
God does not want us to be like others. He wants us to be like Him. Why? A hint for a small reason is given in the second line: because it does not satisfy. God does not want us to work for things that do not satisfy. 
The main reason, however, is that we have been created in His image and thus should live in His image and feed ourselves in His image as well. Does God make creatures like animals and people, and the Earth for fun? No. He created it to be their Father, to have a loving relationship, an intimate one like a husband and wife should have. 
That is also why we should take care of our bodies and feed it well because other things than good things will destroy it. 
God is saying this because of the holistic aspect. In the next verses in this chapter Isaiah will be talking about the covenant. Why should we as humans accept a bad deal, something like a covenant with the devil where you sign to give up something far more valuable than he has to offer. Something like giving up your soul to burn in hell eternally and drag a huge number of fans with you, while the devil promises you riches, fame, status, power, psychological heights through sex, drugs and alcohol—but great depths with that as well—and ultimately, sometimes as a cause of those depths, death (sometimes as a cause of suicide). For many these heights are only for a decade. Stars like Elvis, Bruce Lee, Janis Joplin and Kurt Cobain died under their fiftieth, fortieth and thirtieth year, respectively.
So God warns us for bigger things by showing us smaller things first. He teaches us to get the best deals. Get the good deals with what you eat, with what you work for, what you buy and sign the covenant that has the best deal, which is—by definition—God's covenant.

**A few more things about bread.** In our age specifically, even if we do buy bread, it is not actually bread, because nowadays they have put so much other stuff in bread, such as fructose syrup, unhealthy yeasts, and they use bad materials such as processed sugars, salt and GMO grain as well. It can barely be called healthy while bread used to so #todo/opzoeken  voedingsvol nutritious/nutritional that Jesus even used the term "our daily bread". 
Now, because of the decline of nutritional value and overweight in our society, carbohydrates are seen as the enemy and bread is seen as something to avoid. Carbohydrates, gluten, GMO, salt and sugar all are to be avoided and even better would be to live vegan and avoid dairy and eggs as well—all things that make up the ingredients for different types of bread. 
There are two things to consider here. First, most bread these days is of inferior quality indeed and is better not to be ingested as our daily bread. Second, on the other hand, another reason that bread is not healthy because of too much sugar, carbohydrates and salt, is because we are getting these too much in the rest of the food we are eating. 

If I am allowed to create a hermeneutical bridge here without compromising in exegesis: back in those days religion was seen as something good. It taught one how to be moral, to live under authority both under God and those God appointed to us, to be social and civil and let not our desires lead us, but through love sacrifice ourselves by being merciful and just, by being gracious and kind, gentle and all other things that show the character of God. 
Later on, so many things have been added to religion that gave this term a bad connotation. Many Christians even use the saying 
> God does not want religion, He wants a relation.  
and even Tim Keller makes the distinction between religion and the Gospel in his book #todo/opzoeken ... . The definition of religion, however, is looking for God and that is exactly what Christians are doing. #todo/opzoeken  artikel opzoeken in Daily Wire over dit punt. We just do not want to associated with the bad aspects of it and therefore have used a new word. 
Just like the word *Christians* has a bad association because of all the people who say they believe in God but do not act as such. Now there are deeper levels of Christianity by saying that one is a *reborn Christian* or *a follower of Christ* or someone *walking in the light*.
So that is the first part, too much stuff has been put into religion just as it has been done in bread. The second part of this argument is that too much of the good elements of religion are obtained or done outside of religion already. 
Where do we get most of our salt from? Usually not from bread, but from fries, pizza, cheese and other unhealthy snacks. It is not a wise argument to eat less bread, so that you can eat more pizza, rather it is better to eat less pizza and eat healthy bread. 
In religion it is the same. Non-believers look at religion and say that good things are done, such as societal work and moral lessons. But they say that these things can be done through other religions and organizations outside of religion as well. What they do not realize, however, is that these good elements come in bad forms. 
Outside of religion good works are done to ease one's conscience and feelings of guilt, to create a good image, to spend time for those who are bored, not out of genuine altruism and love for God and obedience to Him. 
Moral lessons are taught everywhere, nowadays by the media, through (Hollywood) movies and even comedians such as Jimmy #todo/opzoeken  what's the name of that guy who kept saying Matt Damon would appear, not Jimmy Kimmel or Fallon.
That is why people do not need the morality of the Bible anymore. Of course they are wrong, because not only are the moral values of the world not sufficient, they are also not correct. 

Lastly, an extra analogy with bread could be that there is too much variety in it. There is the Lebanese flatbread, Indian roti, Dutch or German floor bread, French croissant, brioche and Parisienne (the French are masters in bread), Chinese bao (buns) and not to forget the sourdough whole wheat for example, some containing more nutrients than others and some tasting better than the other. #church/material 
This too can give bread a bad image. My wife, for example, has been exposed to bad quality of bread, plain white (toast) bread and later on to semi whole wheat bread. She never had quality organic whole wheat or sourdough bread fresh and warm from the bakery.
The same goes for churches and "semi-churches" like those of Jehova's Witnesses, the Mormons and people of other sects or cults who call themselves Christians. 

*3 Incline your ear, and come to me;*
*hear, that your soul may live;*
*and I will make with you an everlasting covenant,*
*my steadfast, sure love for David.*

Yesterday I had a talk with someone who said she did not believe in God and that it was probably because her heart was not honest enough 虔誠, #todo/opzoeken  
Of course we all know that God is the first person Who acts and chooses us. Also, all of us are not honest and pure enough. That is not the question. The question is whether we can say that someone does not believe because he has not opened his heart or his ears enough. 
This woman told me that she indeed had a moment where she had to choose between Buddhism and Christianity and she chose to abandon the latter, in part due to a rebellious nature and due to pressure put on her that she *had* to go to church. 
But is that the case with everyone? Surely not everyone even gets this choice of going to church, but is there always an excuse such as teenage rebellion and pressure? 

Whatever the answer, God asks us to *incline* our ears, I think that means to *open* our ears, to come and to hear—so that our soul may live. 
I was going to say that there are three verbs here, inclining, coming and hearing, and that coming is the only action you can actually do. Humans cannot literally sharpen their ears to get better reception and people cannot choose to hear or not. But I think this verse should be interpreted differently. The first two lines are built up of something like a cause and effect. The first line indicates the appropriate attitude and order in which things must be done. It seems like God is saying here:
> *First* incline you ears, *then* come to me.  
Do not go to God without your ears sharpened. It will be a waste of your time to go to church, a waste of their time and you might even misinterpret all you have heard there. 
The second line paraphrased, is
> *If* you hear me, *then* your soul may live.   
Of course the deeper meaning here is the explanation of the *reason* why we should hear God and that is *so that* our soul may live. 

Now inclining your ears may not be possible, but to improve your reception there are several things you can do. Getting closer to the source of the sound is one of those things. However, that would be contradictory. If God were to tell you to get closer to Him so that you can you can hear Him better, yet He says not to come near Him unless your hearing is good, then what are you supposed to do? 
Even though human beings cannot turn and move their ears like dogs, for example, to increase their hearing, humans *can* focus mentally on a specific sound source. Just like when you are in a crowded train and can focus on what a single person is saying while filtering out all of the "background noise". I do not know how the brain does that, but it has to do with concentration and perhaps with corresponding movements of the other as well. For example, if the other person's lips are moving according to what you hear then those lips help you focus on what this person is saying. Perhaps looking at someone's head and hand movements will help as well. 
#church/material

I think that this is a prerequisite to come to God. You cannot come to Him, but He comes to you. He is everywhere around you, so in that sense He does not need to *come*, but what *coming* means, is that God will speak to you as soon as you focus on hearing Him, by being quiet, focusing on His voice only and not the background noise, watching not His lips, but His "hands" move in your life and that of others.
Then, when you hear God telling you to come, you may come and then you will hear more than just His voice, you will hear His Word, what His desire is, how great His grace and mercy are and how much He loves you. 
Now hearing this per se will not let your soul live, that is it is a necessary condition but not a sufficient one. You need to hear His Word, because only then you know what action to take and you can actually do it. 
The action you then need to take is to choose and accept God and surrender to Him, with *all* of your life, for *everything* of Him. Note that these are two decisions. You can choose to give part of your life or your whole life, that is the first choice. The second choice is this: you can choose to follow a few laws of God or all of It. 
In all, there are four possibilities. If you only partially obey God in part of His Words, you will be what is called a Christian in the flesh—even though that term should not exist, because there could not be such a contradictory thing. This type of person would be like someone not interested in reading the Word, but when he reads it or hears about a law, he relativizes it. An example of such a thing is a gay person who calls himself a believer but does not obey most of God's laws and what he does know about homosexual sin, he relativizes into a sin of being not hospitable. 
The second type of person is one who fully obeys God, but only part of His laws. This some people would also call a Christian in the flesh, because there are still things that the Christian attaches and cannot get rid of. It is not because he cannot get rid of these things, it is because he does not think they are wrong. In essence, he only follows the rules he does agree with, even if it is not easy. The difference with the former type is that the former is easy on every law, and relies on the so-called hyper grace theory, that  God will forgive every sin and therefore sinning is no problem anymore. 
This second type is often embodied in Christians who do not pay their taxes, because they are still materialistic in nature or because they do not have enough faith. They also do not follow the rules of the Sabbath and tithing, although the latter is not a fixed number anymore, but they skip the rules when it is convenient for them.
The third type is one who obeys God partially, but to all of His commands. Those could be named Pharisees. They know the whole Law and they obey it in human's eyes, but the core of the Law, which can only be fulfilled through one's heart, they do not obey.

#todo/afmaken
* The hyper grace (the gracious glutton)
* The fleshy Christian (fleshy fellow)
* The Phalanxious #todo/opzoeken Pharisee
* The follower of Jesus who walks in His light, and accepts Jesus as Savior and King. The saved servant. 

*4 Behold, I made him a witness to the peoples,*
*a leader and commander for the peoples.*

It is no doubt that Jesus is the leader for the peoples and the only right one. Moses was a good one in our sight, but he depended on God to provide for water and bread. A true leader would provide himself. 
Moses was humble, the most humble in the whole world, but he still had fits of rage when he saw injustice to God or to His people—which caused him to kill the Egyptian and to break the tablets. 
So no matter how good Moses was, Jesus is better. Jesus had rage as well, but controlled rage. He made a rope and trashed the materials, but it does not say He whipped the people. He made remarks about the Pharisees and He could have said things such as "whitewashed stones" like John the Baptist did, or some other insults like Paul #todo/opzoeken  did in Acts. Paul apologized because he did not know he was speaking to authority, but Jesus would not have to apologize because He is the Authority. 
Still, we do not see Him cursing the Pharisees and scribes, or punishing them, because He has things under control and He does not want to mess up any plans His Father has for Him. 

*5 Behold, you shall call a nation that you do not know,*
*and a nation that did not know you shall run to you,*
*because of the Lord your God, and of the Holy One of Israel,*
*for he has glorified you.*

The land of Israel will be so famous that other countries who did not know Israel will now know it. 
It is hard to imagine in this day of information that is available to everyone who has access to the Internet, that anyone would not know about Israel. It is even hard to imagine that in those days, because Israel was known for its miracles and for king Solomon's riches and wisdom for example. But perhaps further north, east and south, in Russia and Australia for example they might never have heard of Israel. Not China, because the Chinese travelled all the way to Morocco and crossed through Israel on their way.

[#todo  hier nog een stuk van Evernote in plaatsen dat ik had geschreven. Waarschijnlijk nog niet gesynchroniseerd vanaf de OnePlus.]

As I understand it, something happened, perhaps a famine or something else, and other nations heard about it and wanted to see it. Perhaps God is talking about the incarnation of Jesus Christ when the wise men from the east were coming to visit the King. 

*6 “Seek the Lord while he may be found;*
*call upon him while he is near;*

On one hand God comes to man, while on the other hand He may be found. Is that a contradiction? No. It is always certain that God comes to man first. He reached out to man by offering Him grace. For us this was 2000 years ago and so now it is our turn to respond to His grace. But how about the people in Isaiah? Did God offer His grace through His Son, when Jesus would come 700 years later? 
Those people too, from the very first person, Adam, on had already received God's grace, simply by knowing His Name. 
God made Himself known through His Word and through people's hearts. They knew what was wrong. They could respond to God by doing the right things. For Jews even more, they would have to know all about God's grace by reading the stories of their own people in Judges through Kings.
A second point that might lead people to think this verse contains contradictions, is the word "while". Is God not already near you? Can He not always be found, no matter how much we sin? 
God is most certainly present all the time, but that does not mean He may be found. God can hide Himself from one person, but show Himself to the person very next to Him. He was clearly present in David and Samuel but invisible and unhearable by Saul. So no, God can not always be found. God can hide Himself temporarily or forever. God gives a number of chances to each person. After those chances God will not be in touch with you anymore. After a certain number of wasted chances even repentance will not suffice anymore. 
We can see this not only in 1 Samuel about Saul, but also in Exodus #todo/opzoeken concerning the pharaoh of Egypt, whose heart got hardened by God. 

*7 let the wicked forsake his way,*
*and the unrighteous man his thoughts;*
*let him return to the Lord, that he may have compassion on him,*
*and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.*

In this verse too we see three steps in the process of being pardoned. The sinful person, denoted here by wicked and unrighteous, must *forsake* his way *and* his thoughts; he must *return* to the Lord and God must *pardon* him. 
Each step has its difficulties. 
To forsake your way, you need perseverance. For most people it is not something you can do right in one time. Most people will fail and will need to try again. And even if  they succeed in forsaking the way, they must still forsake their thoughts. That, perhaps, is the hardest part of all, for I think that in most—if not all—cases it is the thought that leads the way. 
The second step comes, which is to *return* to the Lord. Return means *going back*. But how does one go back if he has been raised as an atheist and has never believed in a God? Surely there is one thing he can go back to, which is his righteous life. Though each man is born sinful, his sins only start piling up as soon as he intentionally and by definition knowingly transgress the Law. 
I believe there is an age before which nurture is of great influence. Any child under approximately seven years of age who sins, is most likely and for the greatest part influenced by his caretakers and surroundings. For a small part this child is "innocent" in as far as people can ever be innocent, given their age. 
Within this innocence they must be able to hear God, for everyone has been created with a heart, a soul and a spirit. These are the "tools" God created in us to connect with him and which distinguishes us from other animals. (As a side note: perhaps these tools are visible in the human body as well, such as through the tongue bone structure—which allows us to speak—and our brain size and consequentially its capacity—which allows us to form words and thoughts and with those communicate with God.)
So as long as their heart not been hardened, they should be able to find God, provided that God has already come to them first. 
This "first" means that God does not come to everyone, but only those He has chosen. This would also mean that those not chosen by God would not be able to hear Him. 
This step of seeking God is also a difficult one. For far too often we are distracted and disrupted in our search for Him. We get distracted by our goals—why is it necessary to look for a Creator? Why can I not just focus on my career or family?—and disrupted by the devil in making us believe He does not exist, through ways as evolution, immorality of humanity and pain. 
Provided they can hear Him, the third step ...

I lost all of my data on these two verses and part of the data on verse 7, in short everything I wrote on 20190212—which only amounts to half an hour, but half an hour of spiritual inspiration nonetheless. 
But perhaps there was a reason to losing the text I wrote. What I wrote was that Gods ways are not only higher in that we do not know them, and that God has infinitely more possibilities of achieving His plans than we do, but also that God's ways and thoughts could be so much higher than we can ever comprehend. It is just like a dog trying to comprehend a human, or a worm trying to comprehend a being even more complex than humans. 

W.L. Craig against physics professor about how unjust God is, by comparing it with a person who created sentient robots and destroys them all. But his opponent forgets that humans can never make sentient robots and we will never be able to, because we are too limited. So we cannot imagine *how* it will be. It is on a whole other level we are operating if we ever were to talk about these decisions and the morality of it. 
The thing is, if we were ever able, then yes, we would have the right to kill it as well, because if we were able to do that, we would be so wise and so intelligent that we would know what morality truly means as well. 
But the fact is that we are not able to do this and so we do *not* understand God's decisions and cannot even hypothetically fathom the thought of destroying our sentient beings. Therefore, we cannot judge about it—most certainly not by extrapolating the thought of how ... #todo nog af te maken

Humans could never create sentient beings, because they do not even understand their own sentience and where it comes from. They know it is somewhere in the brain, but they do not understand how the brain works. They have mapped a few places of electric activity in the brain during certain types of activities, but that still is backward engineering on a laughable scale. This mapping would not even work on ambidextrous people and will probably work differently on people with mental illnesses. 
Now our creations, if we could ever *create* something, which we will not—for, as I have mentioned before, humans never create anything but only build things out of things already created; they have never built a cell, perhaps a molecule though, but that is about as far as it gets, they have never grown or healed anything, bones and skin heal by themselves, the doctor only patches up the patient—would never be on the level of humans, because we could not impute knowledge of our system in them, because we simply do not have this knowledge. 
God could have done that, He could have created lesser gods and He probably has done so with angels. But even angels would never fully comprehend God. 
Would God be able to create a being as great as He is? That is a philosophical question and the answer is not answerable. He can do anything, but He could never not be the Only One. If He could, though, this Being would be God Himself and then there would be two Gods, but because they would by definition be equally smart, they would not be alike, they would be exactly the same, in character, Name, personality etc. This second God would merge with the first God to One again. 
But back to what I started with. I think it was necessary to write down this appraisal of Gods holiness, His uniqueness and unfathomability. #todo/opzoeken/engels 
To Him alone be the glory forever and ever. Amen!

::*10 “For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven*::
::*and do not return there but water the earth,*::
::*making it bring forth and sprout,*::
::*giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,*::

The beauty of water is that none of it goes to waste. Literally everywhere it goes, something is done with it. It can go to the depths of the ocean or in caves, where no sunlight ever appears, and still some bacteria who can be found only at those places, will live in these waters.
It is such a long process of where water goes and what it does. It makes seeds sprout into vegetables, trees and fruit, all the while staying in this wood or in this fruit, until it is used on another place. 
I have heard stories of trees who experienced their own stories. The wood of three trees was made into a crib, a boat and a cross. Each tree had a good story to share. 
But the story of water drops would be even more fantastic. The story would be that the droplet was in a seed and then went forth to the fruit. Then it went inside a body and help out flush the bad #todo/opzoeken stoffen. Then it fell in the sewer and then there are a plethora of possibilities of where it could end up. One of those is that it vaporized in the air, yet from there on another plethora of possibilities open up. #todo  Verhaal schrijven hierover

Of course this cannot be completely alike with God's Word. The Word, which is Jesus, in Greek *rheima*, creates things and life; the written Word of God, which is the Bible, in Greek *logos*, gives spiritual life to those already living a physical life. 

::*11 so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth;*::
::*it shall not return to me empty,*::
::*but it shall accomplish that which I purpose,*::
::*and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.*:: #biblestudy/memorization/todo

God is speaking of *logos* here #todo/opzoeken  and He says it will not return empty. Not only will it not be empty, it will accomplish that which God has purposed. This means that every word from the Word, every time someone opens the Word, or perhaps reads a few words from a verse on a billboard, the Word accomplishes its purpose and succeeds in the thing for which God sent it. 
Now you might not see the effect or perhaps even a contrary effect, such as someone getting even more against at God when reading the Bible—Richard Dawkins is one of those, getting examples from the Old Testament where God commands the Israelites to kill other peoples. But then too, we may assume, the Word accomplished its purpose. Apparently Gods purpose was to ignite anger in this person. 
In the situations where we not only see no effect but where there actually is no effect, we may assume God did not want this person to be able to read it. God not only opens hearts, He opens eyes as well. As a matter of fact, in the beginning of Isaiah God was clear about this. #todo/opzoeken  I'm not exactly sure where, but God says He made some of them deaf and blind, so that they would not hear the Word and be converted. 
How has this verse then actually accomplished anything? It is God then Who did something in this person's eyes or brain, by not letting him understand this verse, is it not? It is not the verse itself that did anything. The answer is that God indeed is the One Who worked, but the person reading this verse will remember this verse and also remember that this verse did not have any effect on him. 
It could very well be that a "neutral" person would read a verse without feeling anything and without any negative thoughts. Some time later this person might think: "Let me pick the Bible again and see if I can get anything from it", just to give it another shot. Then, his eyes might be opened the second or third time he reads it. 
If God does not want this, He can make this person remember that he read it and that there was no feeling, so why would there be any feeling this time? 
So even in not having any effect on the listener or reader God's Word can accomplish its purpose. 

*12 “For you shall go out in joy*
*and be led forth in peace;*
*the mountains and the hills before you*
*shall break forth into singing,*
*and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.*
*13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress;*
*instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle;*
*and it shall make a name for the Lord,*
*an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.”*

In verses 6 and 7 God commands the wicked and unrighteous to turn from their ways, and then He gives a number of reasons, all starting with "for". 
> *For my thoughts are not your thoughts,*  
> *For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven...*  
> *For you shall go out in joy and be led forth in peace;*  

Paraphrasing, this means the reason why we must turn from our old ways is that
* we do not know what God's supernatural goal and purpose is
* the Word will always accomplish its purpose. There is no chance for us to escape from it. 
* what we do know is that obedience to God will lead to joy and peace. 

An example of this would be as follows. 
Suppose there is a dark alley and God tells you not to go in there and God tells you: "I can explain this to you, but you will not understand anyway. 
Then you are thinking, well, I do understand that there is some kind of warning, but there is always a chance that this warning will not come true right? Are there not always exceptions? 
But then God says: "No, my Word—i.e. the consequences of not obeying my rules and even my advice—will *always* be accomplished."
Then you might think, "Ok, I will accept the negative consequences, but I will have positive ones as well, right?" 
Again, God says: "No, if you want joy and peace in your heart, that is not the way for you to go. You will have to walk My way."
