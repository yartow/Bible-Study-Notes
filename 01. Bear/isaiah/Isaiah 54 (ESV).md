# Isaiah 54 (ESV)
**The Eternal Covenant of Peace**
*1 “Sing, O barren one, who did not bear;*
*break forth into singing and cry aloud,*
*you who have not been in labor!*
*For the children of the desolate one will be more*
*than the children of her who is married,” says the Lord.*

God can make barren women fertile again, at any age, but He can also give women children without them being married. What can we say of Amy Carmichael who fostered so many children in India either involved in temple prostitution or merely an inch away from it. And what about ... #todo/opzoeken see Torchlighters, active during the Japanese war in China, being the spiritual and foster mother of many children?
I know that this is not what women are looking for when they simply want a child. But I think that it is exactly because of children, that women become weak and care more for their own child than others.
Having a child of your own is a blessing, but on the other hand, it is a blessing given for the weaker ones among women. The strongest women are those who can take care of children not their own, yet bestow on them the love of a biological mother. Or even more, those who can take on multiple children; or even more, those who are willing to take on the most difficult ones of them all, rascals, criminals, children who have been in and out of juvenile prisons and foster families. 

*2 “Enlarge the place of your tent,*
*and let the curtains of your habitations be stretched out;*
*do not hold back; lengthen your cords*
*and strengthen your stakes.*

God promises that the children of the barren woman will be more than of the fertile woman. Not only does He say this, but He also says to enlarge her tent *in advance*. It is a step of faith to enlarge one's tent, for it could be that nothing came and this one would be laughed by bystanders asking why your tent is enlarged even though this person is alone or with her husband if she is married. 
God takes it even a step further and says "do not hold back" as He wants us to take large steps of faith. 

*3 For you will spread abroad to the right and to the left,*
*and your offspring will possess the nations*
*and will people the desolate cities.*

Is God making this promise to everyone or only to the Israelites? First of all, I've read in MacSBNnkjv that the promises for Israel cannot be extrapolated to Christians. Second of all, this statement was only meant for the barren, and I suppose God means women then. 
The Israelites, or the the Jews, did indeed spread all over the world and peopled desolate cities, although I am not sure which cities exactly. Their offspring did possess the nations, though not necessarily as a Jew, but if we only look at how many Jews controlled and still control nations through the world of finance, science and academia. Now, though heavily weakened due to anti-Semitism due to the conflict with strongholds in so-called Palestinian areas, they still control their own country, in the midst of the Middle-East, who are against them and literally have pointed their weapons and rockets towards them. 
They controlled the nations most definitely. After a dispersion of Jews, most fortunately not a mass killing, across North-Africa, illiteracy rose and the economy dropped, due to the Jews leaving and taking all their knowledge with them. 

*4 “Fear not, for you will not be ashamed;*
*be not confounded, for you will not be disgraced;*
*for you will forget the shame of your youth,*
*and the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more.*

The Jews who fled North-Africa might have felt a lot of shame that they could not be part of the nation where they grew up and built their lives, and that their own country and fellowmen kicked them out, because they were Jewish. But in the eyes of God, and in our eyes, the Jews were brave because they did not follow the Islam just so that they could stay there. 
However, this verse is about widows. I thought the previous verses were about women who could not or did not have children, either married or unmarried, but of course, widows are a category as well. 
God is talking about women who were widowed at a young age, fertile and infertile, and those widowed at an older age, but infertile. These are the only reasons why these widows would be barren. 
In God's eyes they do not have to be ashamed. God allowed them to be barren for a reason. Not always is it because they are stronger and more fit for the task of taking care of multiple children. Sometimes it is because they are unfit to take care of anyone, take for example those who are disabled in any way. 
Either way, God comforts those women and lets them know that a husband as He is, is even more important and sufficient. 

*5 For your Maker is your husband,*
*the Lord of hosts is his name;*
*and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer,*
*the God of the whole earth he is called.*

What would it be worth to you, to lose everything that gives you status, respect and fulfills you thought-to-be purpose? I am speaking children here, but more than that as well. Women would be longing to have these three things. Their children would give them status, as women with many children were seen as blessed by God. Respect would probably come along with it, or at least not the condescending look of other women who would think you were blessed or to be pitied. Also, their purpose would be to bring up their children. 
Would it be worth losing all of this to gain one husband, who is better than all other husbands? I think so. Even when you have no children, but a wonderful and romantic and loving husband, women who have a lot of children but not this kind of husband would envy you and tell you how lucky you are, even though you would be telling them how lucky *they* are to have so many children. 
The barren woman, however, does not understand that most children are not something a parent is pleased with every day. Most children are stubborn, need care or discipline, extra tuition and moral wisdom as well. It is a day task. But where the happily married woman has a supporting partner in her life, to support her in every field, not only in taking care of children, but also in how to dress or behave, the other women have a husband who is demanding aside from and on top of your already (physically and mentally) demanding children. 
In short, the other women can tell from their experience that it is better to be barren with a good husband than the other way around. Now God is even better than a good husband, so the answer is easily found to be "yes", finding God is definitely worth losing everything you try to gain in this life for. 

*6 For the Lord has called you*
*like a wife deserted and grieved in spirit,*
*like a wife of youth when she is cast off,*
*says your God.*

Now God is or was not speaking to barren women literally, but to the people of Israel. They had become barren and lost their children. Perhaps it is because the children did not want to leave Persia—some of them had already been there for twee generations—but the parents did want to back to Israel. 
We all lose children when our children grow up in the West. Most of them convert to atheism or leave Christianity in another way, how fearful would that be for someone whose children decide to follow a pagan god such as Buddha, Hindu or Allah. 

*7 For a brief moment I deserted you,*
*but with great compassion I will gather you.*
*8 In overflowing anger for a moment*
*I hid my face from you,*
*but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you,”*
*says the Lord, your Redeemer.*

In Isaiah 50:1, God asked the rhetorical question of *when* he divorced the Israelites or sold them. It was rhetorical because the answer was *never*. 
Here He explains in more details what He has done. Though this seems contradictory with his rhetorical argument, it is not, because Isaiah 50 was about divorcing and not deserting. Especially deserting *temporarily* is a whole other approach than divorcing. Whereas divorce means one is tired and gives up, because he cannot hold out anymore, deserting temporarily could mean the woman—in this case—should learn her lesson, or the man needs some time to gather strength and try again. 
God deserted Israel temporarily for Israel's sake, to let them realize how much they needed God and how bad the other gods would "treat" them or, in other words, how well they would fare without God by their side and enemies all around. 
God *was* angry, though for a moment, and therefore hid His face from Israel. But notice the contrast God speaks of here: Angry for a moment vs. love *everlasting*. As a matter of fact there is not even a "versus" in here. The momentary anger is part of the everlasting love. God loved us from the very beginning and will always do so, and somewhere in the middle there is momentary anger. 

*9 “This is like the days of Noah to me:*
*as I swore that the waters of Noah*
*should no more go over the earth,*
*so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you,*
*and will not rebuke you.*

This, now, is a more difficult question because this really looks like a contradiction with verse 8. God never has been angry with people in that way again. For God perhaps, or perhaps there are different words for different kinds and levels of anger in Hebrew, the anger in verse 9 is different from that of verse 8. Remember that in verse 8 it was a *momentary* anger meant to let the object repent of his mistakes. In verse 9, however, God is speaking about an anger that wipes out all humanity, of such great force that there is no forgiveness anymore (but assuming there had been a chance, in Noah's case of approximately 120 years). 
#biblestudy/questions contradiction with verse 8? MacSBNnkjv says that this oath is about the period *after* the restoration of Israel. But is this the oath? 

So that is the first explanation, namely that God is speaking about different kinds of anger. The second explanation is that God is not speaking about now, but about the future, after the second coming of Christ. At that time God will not be angry with us anymore, because then evil will have gone and those who have made their choice to be with God when there was a choice, i.e. here on Earth and during their lifetime, will go up to heaven or Paradise. Then, when God has removed the Satan, the question is whether there is still evil in our hearts, which although cannot be incited by the Satan, it can still come out, be it ever so little. 
In any case, if God says He will never be angry, I will assume that even if there is evil present anywhere, it will never come out. 

*10 For the mountains may depart*
*and the hills be removed,*
*but my steadfast love shall not depart from you,*
*and my covenant of peace shall not be removed,”*
*says the Lord, who has compassion on you.*

God knows how long it took for mountains to depart. As a matter of fact, I think that the mountains we currently see have never departed in a natural way, unless they were destroyed in some way. Either way, it takes a long time, longer than humanity can survive here on Earth. Before all humanity goes extinct, I presume, Jesus will have come back and in an instant afterwards destroy Earth with fire. Most probably all the mountains will be destroyed then. 
So in other words, God's love for us steadfast and will not depart from us, at least until after the New Earth. 
This then is also valid for God covenant of peace. What is this *covenant of peace* exactly? #biblestudy/questions According to MacSBNnkjv, the answer is given in Isaiah 59:21, it is the covenant where God says that His Holy Spirit is on "us" and that His words will never depart us or our offspring. 
Even more questions arise then, such as "who is *us*?" If "us" refers to the Israelites, then that means the Holy Spirit is or was on the Jews. Another question is whether only God's words will never depart "us" or that *both* God's words *and* His Holy Spirit will never depart us? A third question is whether God means by His words His actual words or *the Word*, i.e. the Bible? #todo/opzoeken reima or logos used here?
Combining the different possible answers it could mean the following: 
"Us" could refer to all nations, but including at least Israel.  
The Holy Spirit is on at least some of the Jews, as it was on Saul, David and Samson. 
I think this will stay an unanswered question for me until later. The general consensus or doctrine, at least, is that the Holy Spirit will never leave Christians, since after Jesus' ascension to heaven. This does rise the question of whether the verse before can be applied to this age as well. 

#todo/opzoeken Which and how many covenants of God with Israel and others are there? 

*11 “O afflicted one, storm-tossed and not comforted,*
*behold, I will set your stones in ::antimony::,*
*and lay your foundations with sapphires.*
*12 I will make your pinnacles of ::agate::,*
*your gates of ::carbuncles::,*
*and all your wall of precious stones.*

**The stones.** Stones were used as a remembrance when Joshua and the Israelites crossed the Jordan river; the patriarchs used these as well to remember encounters with God. Perhaps this verse means that our memories, the good ones at least, will be preserved by God. Not only will they be remembered, they will be placed in a prominent place. 
Though the world does not know many of the Christian and Jewish martyrs, even when they are written in the Bible, or just outside of it, such as the disciples of Christ, in heaven or somewhere else these memories are placed prominently, for God to see and perhaps for others in heaven as well. 
**The foundation.** Our foundations are the most important thing here in life. It is what makes life pleasing. Our foundations are in Jesus Christ, that is our moral values about every aspect of life. The breaking of foundations are what cause pain and strife in the current world, hunger for power and jealousy and everything else that is negative. But it all started because the world chose to build their house on something else than the Rock.
This foundation as well has been forgotten by most people, but God will put it in sapphires, so that no one can pass by it without noticing it. It will be so beautiful and remarkable that people want to touch it. It will be so hard that people will want to test it to see if they can make any scratch on it, which they cannot, unless they have diamonds. #todo/opzoeken  diamonds in the Bible? Already existed? 
This exactly is what God has done with the foundation of Jesus Christ, that is His Word. The Word and recorded version of it, the Bible, has been tested, but nothing has broken its claims and no book on Earth has more historical value and truth, or even predictive and moral truth, that this book. 
People have tried to replace God's moral values with science, with so-called post-modernism to show that the moral values in the Bible are old-fashioned and not fitted for the current age, with concepts such as fluidity and non-binary genders and a *difference* between gender and sex, which there is not and which used to be synonymous. 
We can see how this foundation of theirs is already crumbling. It will cause a cease in births, which is bad for the economy, unless IVF is used, which is less beneficial for society, due to emotional and mental health issues for those born from it. People are not happier and actually have a higher suicide rate (when they commit to sex change operations). In every aspect of life and society and any form of healthy, their foundation is worse than Jesus'. 
**The pinnacles.** The pinnacles, *plural*, of our being is that we are children of God and Jesus' friends. There is nothing greater than that. It is worth dying for. It is worth living here on Earth for and to go through everything the bravest martyrs have gone through. 
As for Jesus, perhaps the greatest thing He has done is dying on the cross. I am not sure whether that is a greater thing than creating the whole universe. But it was more painful. 
If we are talking about human pinnacles, then I would say it is the establishment of anything that is Bible-like and what Christians have invented, hospitals, universities (perhaps), capitalism (as a logical results of the American Constitution) and equal and human rights. By the way, even if the discovery of DNA was by a Christian, I would not mention it in this list, because it is not an invention. 
Humans have invented a great many things, but nothing, no technology, has had such a profound impact on humanity as those things done by Christians simply because the Bible commanded us to do so. 

**The gate.** The gate is that part through which other peoples enter the city. It is a symbol of the city and sometimes of everything that happened there as well. Paris has the Arc de Triomph, and New York Miss Liberty. Washington DC has the Lincoln Memorial and Amsterdam the memorial to remember WWII veterans. 
It is also the place where local government resides and where, I assume, taxes are being geïnd #todo/opzoeken  inned? collected.
If the gates are laid in with jewels, figuratively, then God blesses even the local government. Where in the history of this world have we ever seen a government who has done so much for its country or city that it should be praised and remember? We know of US presidents who died, such as JFK, and those who have been relatively good, such as Reagan, but those like Lincoln are less than a handful. As for other countries, I know not many, but God will make sure that this will be the case in Jerusalem and in all of Israel, or at least in the New Jerusalem in the New World. 
God's Law is perfect, which means His civil law and governmental laws, which are of it, are perfect as well. Imagine what the world would be if everyone held dearly to God's moral laws. We would have a pure and lovely world, without all of the things on the political agendas the separate parties. There, in fact, would be no parties left, because there would be nothing to differ on. 
Immigration would be no problem if everyone keeps the rules, euthanasia and abortion, gay marriages and other issues would be agreed on if everyone had God's Law on His heart. 
The nature and the environment though, might still be an issue. Even if everyone already maintained strict rules on separation of waste, and no factories would dump their waste in the rivers or oceans, and the temperature of the Earth would still be rising, then there would be some still inclined to think that it is due to human interference with nature. 

**The wall.** God has given us a wall to protect us. But just like with government above, people look at walls as being bad and ugly things, causing separation and segregation, such as the Berlin Wall. Or take the Great Wall in China, for example, which was created with forced labor and during the building of which killed as many people as its length (in meters) through this labor and the circumstances. I do not even need to speak of the wall in the United States on the Mexican border—which does not have a name yet. 
The walls God will give us will be made of carbuncle, another gem. People will look proudly at them, which means they will realize how many bad things are kept out. They will see the advantages of having this wall. 
They will know that is the wall that provides them safety. They will thank God for it. 
At last, God receives thanks and appreciation for all that He has done. 

*13 All your children shall be taught by the Lord,*
*and great shall be the peace of your children.*

Perhaps now already, some of these events mentioned above will be fulfilled partially, that is *before* the end of the end times. We already see that a small group of people appreciates these five things: 
1. Stones. Historical events by God. 
2. Foundation. A society based on God's Law, including marriage, families and the correct way of courtship. 
3. Pinnacles. The great things achieved in the name of Christianity, with Jesus' death on top. 
4. Gates. A government obedient to God's will. 
5. Walls. God's Law which is perpetual and perfect. 
The rest of the world, however, does not see God's perfect view of a foundation, achievements, government, etc. as perfect. 

#church/material

*All your children shall be taught by the Lord.* Orthodox Jews have taught their children well. Of course there must be Jews from orthodox families who have rebelled and escaped Judaism altogether or they have become not secular Jews, but slightly milder orthodox Jews, like Ben Shapiro, without the beard, but perhaps without the #todo/opzoeken keppeltje. In Christianity there are Amish people as well who have learned to live according to God's laws. However, it seems that they are bound by their community to live in such a way, and hidden from the world, while orthodox Jews are living in the midst of a non-orthodox community, resisting the temptation to become like the secular people. 
Now, however, is not the end of the end times yet, and so we see not that *all* children are taught by the Lord, but some are. Perhaps I am mistaken here, because it says *by* the Lord. I would assume that no one right now is taught *by* the Lord, but perhaps that means that one learns *about* the Lord. 

Those who have been taught, correctly, by the Lord and those who have accepted, have become good Christians (or Jews, but I am not sure, for if they had truly been taught by the Lord, would they have not learned that Jesus should have been in the picture as well?) and they have great piece. 
In fact, they have so much piece that they are willing to give up all they have, which for some (missionaries) was a lot, such as an education, a job and career, status, perhaps even their family, and friends, and of course their home country, and go to another country where they not only knew no one at all, but had to work hard for their living, to help others and to do work for the Kingdom, such as translating the Bible, sometimes without ever seeing the fruit of it, and yet be persecuted by their surroundings and the government. 
I am thinking of Adoniram Judson while I am writing this, but there are many more, more than the *Torchlighters* series has animated. 
This might be (an example of) the pinnacle of inner peace, although it is actually external peace, peace from God Who lives within us. 

*14 In righteousness you shall be established;*
*you shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear;*
*and from terror, for it shall not come near you.*

This has deep meaning. Isaiah does not mean to say you will have no oppression at all, what Isaiah says, is that you will not have "real oppression", because we will not fear. The same goes for terror, which we will not experience as long as we trust in God. 
The real oppression is the inner oppression, where one has fear and stress and is not free. If something "presses" on you, you have not much space to go to anymore. 
But if something physical oppresses you and we are not afraid, then spiritually, mentally and emotionally we are still as free as birds. 

*15 If anyone stirs up strife,*
*it is not from me;*
*whoever stirs up strife with you*
*shall fall because of you.*

God has allowed other countries to attack the Israelites, but being captive or killed were never the only outcomes. The Israelites had a chance and a choice, up until the very last moment. Their strife within their fellow Israelites, or between Israel in the north and Judah in the south, was their own choice.
Judah had once tried to attack Israel, and lost, not because it was weaker, because right before they had won a very big war against a powerful enemy. #todo/opzoeken But they lost, because they should not have attacked their brother. 

*16 Behold, I have created the smith*
*who blows the fire of coals*
*and produces a weapon for its purpose.*
*I have also created the ravager to destroy;*
*17 no weapon that is fashioned against you shall succeed,*
*and you shall refute every tongue that rises against you in judgment.*
*This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord*
*and their vindication from me, declares the Lord.”*

God purposely writes here not that He created the weapons and all the inventions of man, even though He knew about all of them, but that He created the creators of these. God gave power to those creators but responsibilities as well. This leads to a difficult question, should the creator of weapons have invented the weapon, knowing that it would be used against other humans? 
God was smart enough, however, to create something else as well that would protect His people against those weapons—something against which no weapon would succeed. This something could be either the ravager in verse 16 or God's defense itself. This is a weapon that surpasses the physical realm. 
In the first case, the ravager could be some country controlled by God, such as Babylon, who invades your enemies, but not you. Though the ravager himself is in the physical realm, his control is not. 
In the second case, God has as His "defense" for us His very own blessing, which prevents other human or angelic beings to mess with God's plan for us. 

However, about weapons, first note that God created *someone* to create a weapon *so that* it would have human flaws. God most probably cannot create something that contains any errors—that is my theory. He cannot and will not create a human being with physical handicaps, for example, just to prevent them from ever rising up against Him. He would never make everyone blind so that in the case people become bad, they would still be limited in how much they could hurt God. 
This is because, first of all, God would never get hurt by anything, but second of all, God is good and what comes out of His hands is good. He has made beings less powerful, such as insects and smaller animals, and more powerful, such as the angels, but all of these were made perfect. Even the ability to choose was perfect. The soul, however, though being perfect, had an element of freedom, free choice, controlled by the spirit of man himself. And as soon as something is controlled by man, it is not perfect anymore. 
So God could have created weapons, perfect weapons, but smaller ones, such as knives and a bow and arrow, but he decided not to. Perhaps for the following reasons: 
1. He would never be accused of being the creator of these weapons.
2. Weapons are always used for killing or defense, which in God's perfect world would never be needed. Even as a tool for cutlery or building they would perhaps not be needed. I am wondering though which tools would be used to make instruments in paradise. How would they saw through wood? 
3. If God had created weapons, these would be so good that these would have killed a great deal of animals or men. 
Could God ever create a perfect weapon that could not destroy another one of His perfect weapons? That would be contradictory, even if God created smaller and bigger weapons.
