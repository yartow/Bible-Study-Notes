# Isaiah 4

**Isaiah 4 (NIV)**
*1 In that day seven women*
*will take hold of one man*
*and say, “We will eat our own food*
*and provide our own clothes;*
*only let us be called by your name.*
*Take away our disgrace!”*

In my previous devotional I mentioned how women were, and still are in certain industries, disgraced when they think they have power as a sex symbol. Even men who think this are disgraced. They might get jobs more easy and be selected for modeling and acting jobs, but nobody likes to be appreciated only for the things he was born with.
This is the reason why Affirmative Action in the United States does not work, because it does not give a feeling of content to minorities who apply for this policy; this is also the reason why people like Jessica Alba and models like Cindy Crawford and Heidi Klum pursue careers outside of their ::[...traits...]::, which is their outer appearance.

There is now even more disgrace when women *desire* a husband, even up to the point that they are willing to share one with others. One can say that this is because of the culture, because women could not inherit anything without having children and they could not get a job that paid sufficiently in that time and culture.
But even in this day women still spend billions of money to please men by buying make-up and millions or more in learning how to apply these, billions for skin care products that do not fall under the category of make-up and treatments for better skin and health. 
They strife to outwin other women in order to get a man.

Today, still, a woman who cannot find a man is not an emancipated woman, or a proud feminist. It is someone who cannot please a man and who is lonely and finds comfort only in hiding behind facades of career, money and status, from which she tries to gain pleasure. 

**The Branch of the Lord**
*2 In that day the Branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel. 3 Those who are left in Zion, who remain in Jerusalem, will be called holy, all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem. 4 The Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion; he will cleanse the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire. 5 Then the Lord will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who assemble there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night; over everything the glory will be a canopy. 6 It will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain.*

No matter how dirty something or someone can get, God can always clean it. Even if something is as tender as wool, God can cleanse it through the fire and still preserve it. 
In this way he will preserve the women of Zion, which is their prerogative. The above verses may seem very condescending towards women, but one must understand that men in this context do not have prerogatives. Most of the men sin and die as a cause of their sin. But some of the women are cleansed. 
More than simply cleaning, God will be present and protect the Israelites from all influences, especially from the attacks of the devil, but even from smaller ones such as the weather. 
God is a hiding place where we can go to, not only for disasters, but also for simple rest.
