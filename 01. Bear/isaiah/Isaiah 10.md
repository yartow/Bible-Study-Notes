# Isaiah 10
**Isaiah 10 (NIV)** 
*1 Woe to those who make unjust laws,*
*to those who issue oppressive decrees,*
*2 to deprive the poor of their rights*
*and withhold justice from the oppressed of my people,*
*making widows their prey*
*and robbing the fatherless.*

I think it would not have mattered whether I were in Europe, Asia or the United States, nor whether I was living now, a hundred years or a thousand years ago, or in this case 3000 years ago. Unrighteousness has always been in the people and in the law of countries. Oppression of the poor has always occurred in any country and in any time. Widows and children of single moms have always been the victim. 
In Dutch movies about the past, though it is equally applicable in present day the Netherlands, these two categories have especially been highlighted to show the immorality of our culture back then. Movies such as *Ciske de Rat*, *Karakter* and *Kruimeltje* depict people from that environment. In the United States we see *present day* movies about the black parts of America where even now these categories are suffering tremendously. The setting of movies such as *Step up*, *Boyz in the Hood* and *Gifted Hands* #tags/movies (about Ben Carson), where there is a poor neighborhoods, high crime rates and lack of social control) still is common rather than exceptional, unfortunately.
Though the Netherlands used to have this problem within a subgroup in the white population, it has now transferred to the black population and a third category has risen, people with a father, but who is not very present in the raising of children. In the US this problem occurs with black and Hispanic people as well, because in those cultures the father is not often present or has left the family.

There are a number of unjust laws that are not good for the poor people in society. What I can think of right now are not laws that are directly targeting these minorities to *take* money from them, but rather laws that are *giving* them money. Why is that? It is keeping these people below a comfortable standard of living due to the deprivation of incentives to work. 
It is clear from practical observations that food coupons in the United States and social security in the Netherlands demotivates people to work. Working for a net minimum wage provides only a little bit more financial comfort, but at the cost of not being home 40 hours a week. When someone has children at home, he will need daycare for his children and not see his children for the bigger part of the day. In effect he would have a worse outcome than he would have had when he decided not to work at all. 
A second argument is given, I think, in the book *What's so great about America?* by Dinesh D'Souza. Supermarket rates increase because they know the government will pay for the groceries of those who have food coupons anyway. For a coupon user it does not matter if something costs 1 or 100 dollars. It will just cost him a coupon. While for the normal consumer it does make a big difference. This is a bad way of inflating the economy. 

*3 What will you do on the day of reckoning,*
*when disaster comes from afar?*
*To whom will you run for help?*
*Where will you leave your riches?*
*4 Nothing will remain but to cringe among the captives*
*or fall among the slain.*
*Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away,*
*his hand is still upraised.*

There will be a day when trouble will encounter us and on that day we will not be strong, so we cannot lean in our own power our intelligence. Our riches will not be able to help us, nor will anyone else for everyone will be suffering then. We will only have two choices then, to die or to become a slave. Which one will we choose? 
That is not the question though. The question is how we can turn away God's anger. 
Not by all of the above, for we are sure that God's hand is still upraised. It will take a lot more suffering before the Lord is satisfied with our punishment, before we have received what we deserve.

**God’s Judgment on Assyria**
*5 “Woe to the Assyrian, the rod of my anger,*
*in whose hand is the club of my wrath!*
*6 I send him against a godless nation,*
*I dispatch him against a people who anger me,*
*to seize loot and snatch plunder,*
*and to trample them down like mud in the streets.*
*7 But this is not what he intends,*
*this is not what he has in mind;*
*his purpose is to destroy,*
*to put an end to many nations.*
*8 ‘Are not my commanders all kings?’ he says.*
*9 ‘Has not Kalno fared like Carchemish?*
*Is not Hamath like Arpad,*
*and Samaria like Damascus?*
*10 As my hand seized the kingdoms of the idols,*
*kingdoms whose images excelled those of Jerusalem and Samaria—*
*11 shall I not deal with Jerusalem and her images*
*as I dealt with Samaria and her idols? ’”*
*12 When the Lord has finished all his work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem, he will say, “I will punish the king of Assyria for the willful pride of his heart and the haughty look in his eyes. 13 For he says:*
*“‘By the strength of my hand I have done this,*
*and by my wisdom, because I have understanding.*
*I removed the boundaries of nations,*
*I plundered their treasures;*
*like a mighty one I subdued their kings.*
*14 As one reaches into a nest,*
*so my hand reached for the wealth of the nations;*
*as people gather abandoned eggs,*
*so I gathered all the countries;*
*not one flapped a wing,*
*or opened its mouth to chirp. ’”*

God used Assyria to partially destroy Israel and Judah, but Assyria had other plans in mind and wanted to go further than God allowed. For this reason Assyria herself was destroyed as well. 
It sounds strange to me, because I assume the Assyrian, or the Assyrian king himself, did not hear a prophecy or permission from God to attack Israel now. I suppose it was in his own will to do so. In fact, he probably would have gone against any country he came across. 
But God is right and He most probably must have put some kind of restraint in the king's heart. Something like *I have plundered enough, the people have surrendered, I should not commit any war crimes or torture them without any cause.* Most likely the Assyrian king did not listen to the conscience that God provided—which by itself is punishable enough. This goes for every Assyrian by the way. But if some were righteous, God deals in a different way with those who did listen to their conscience. But we do not know *how* God deals with those people. 

*15 Does the ax raise itself above the person who swings it,*
*or the saw boast against the one who uses it?*
*As if a rod were to wield the person who lifts it up,*
*or a club brandish the one who is not wood!*
*16 Therefore, the Lord, the Lord Almighty,*
*will send a wasting disease upon his sturdy warriors;*
*under his pomp a fire will be kindled*
*like a blazing flame.*
*17 The Light of Israel will become a fire,*
*their Holy One a flame;*
*in a single day it will burn and consume*
*his thorns and his briers.*
*18 The splendor of his forests and fertile fields*
*it will completely destroy,*
*as when a sick person wastes away.*
*19 And the remaining trees of his forests will be so few*
*that a child could write them down.*

In doing so Assyria thought of herself as being greater than the God Who allowed them the victory of Israel, but they did not realize that the Holy One could and would destroy the whole empire of Assyria within just one day.

I am inclined to say that a single event in Biblical history refers strongly to this sickness, which is when Hezekiah prayed to God for protection of Jerusalem when the Assyrians offended God, and the next day all of the Assyrians had died of the plague. 
Not a lot of (extra-Biblical) information is found about this sickness on the Wikipedia article [Hezekiah - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezekiah#Political_moves_and_Assyrian_invasion), unfortunately, and even though the Assyrian siege by Sennacharib would only occur in Isaiah 30, it still seems like a striking resemblance. 

**The Remnant of Israel**
*20 In that day the remnant of Israel,*
*the survivors of Jacob,*
*will no longer rely on him*
*who struck them down*
*but will truly rely on the Lord,*
*the Holy One of Israel.*

The Israelites were relying on buying off their safety by presenting gifts to the Assyrian king, while he would eventually strike them anyway. 
What a great number of miscalculations the Israelites had made. 
Firstly, the Assyrians killed and captured many of the people from their neighboring countries, doing cruel things to them, such as skinning them alive and putting salt on their bodies afterwards. For this reason Jonah did want to forgive them nor give them a chance to repent. 
Secondly, they did the same (probably) to their own brothers, the people from the northern part of Israel. 
So that is two negative things the Assyrians have done. If the Jews from Judah had retributed two negative things to the Assyrians, they would be equal. 
But they had not. In fact, they even sent gifts to them, which is their third miscalculation, praying—one might say—that they would leave Judah alone. 
Fourthly, they not only gave away their precious gold, but even the treasures from the holy temple of *God*, which was not even theirs to give. 
Fifthly, they assumed the Assyrians would listen to them. There was not even an agreement upon which the Israelites had to pay this ransom, Hezekiah decided to just send it and hope the Assyrians would not attack them. Sending a gift first and then asking a request is foolish. 
Sixthly, they trusted the Assyrians would hold themselves to an agreement. Though honor has a high place in this culture and age, would a people so cruel keep their word? Perhaps they would for people of their own family or of their own country, but they would not, as it is clear from history, for the Israelites. 
Seventhly, they did not put their trust in God. This was their greatest mistake and miscalculation.

The people of Israel are many, being fruitful and blessed by God with many children and little sickness, although many may have died during famines and sieges. Assyria was het first siege, as far as I know, but there might have been more disasters, though of a smaller order. 
But this time, it is as if God promises, instead of warns, that only a remnant will remain. A very small portion will remain. 
The people were supposed to show and tell about God's greatness to the world. With such a small remnant there will not be a lot of witnessing anymore of the goodness of God. Rather, it will be the wrath of God that will be testified of here. 
The people might say that God is a god who destroyed his own people, one without love, but that is because they are not aware of the magnitude of the sins the Israelites were in, for they were sinning in worse ways themselves and they did not know either. 
But even if God lacked receiving the glory that was due to Him in doing this act, except for showing that He can destroy a whole nation as He wishes to, which He did with northern Israel,  He more than compensated for this by showing His might and glory through the minute controlling of the attacking countries. He defeated Assyria in Jerusalem, 180 thousand men in one day, the transformation of Nebuchadnezzar and the death of Belshazzar, and the worship of Darius to the Lord God Himself. 
Israel was protected and watched over all this time.

In one go God punished the Israelites with captivity as well as all its oppressors with extinction, although this "go" lasted for several decades.

Before this, hundreds of years passed by without serious oppression or loss in a war of this magnitude. Financial crises occurred due to famine and bad tax policies, but nothing was as invasive as when the Assyrians defeated Israel, both north and south, except for Jerusalem. 

God has shown multiple times in history that He is a patient God, and gives small punishments to warn us, so small they even seem negligible. But when we neglect those, He will not increase the severity of the punishment over time. Though that may *seem* fair to the unexperienced and worldly eye, it actually is sadistic. 
Take the example of the frog who likes the cold water, but is slowly cooked to death, so long as you heat up the water slowly enough. But if you put a frog in hot water at once, it will jump out. This is why God punishes us at once. He does not want us to get used to these punishments as if they are a form of life. As if poverty, slavery and oppression are just part of life. No they are not, and neither is lending money from other countries. 
Israel and America—at one point, whether it still is now, is the question—are the only two countries that are shaped according to God's plan. Though I am not convinced yet of the ideology of separation of church and state—I do understand that that would not be very evangelical if people from another religion were forced to abide by the religious rules of our country—America has a constitution with a Christian background and the constitution of Israel is perhaps based the Judaic Bible as well. 
This is the reason why these two countries are free and rich, have

Criminals and illegalities are one thing, but it is the law that should say how to deal with those. And those opposing the constitution and God's principles are making sure crime rates keep rising and moral values keep sinking.
So everything that is not perfect about Israel and the United States is because of everyone who does not abide by the spirit of the constitution and thereby disobey the law of God. 

*26 The Lord Almighty will lash them with a whip,*
*as when he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb;*
*and he will raise his staff over the waters,*
*as he did in Egypt.*
*27 In that day their burden will be lifted from your shoulders,*
*their yoke from your neck;*
*the yoke will be broken*
*because you have grown so fat.*

One day, however,  the Lord will return to help His own people, as He has always done. The Lord will let His people be taken captive when they are disobedient, but when the peoples executing the commands of God go too far, God will intercede and punish these peoples as well. But as always, God will relent when He thinks the people have suffered enough or learned their lesson and deliver them from the hands of their enemies. He has done this with Egypt (although I do not know what Israel had done wrong there, this is still a mystery to me), many a times in the period of the judges, and once more during the Babylonian siege, when God only released the Jews to go back after the Persians had taken over Babylonia. It is unclear to me, however, what exactly happened with the Jews in Assyria. Were they so sinful and stubborn they were dispersed to never find their identity anymore? Or are they the tribes that kept through which the Jewish heritage kept on living, even when almost every Jew was killed in the Jewish Revolt in 66AD?

This whole part from verses 28 on is showing how the Assyrians approached Jerusalem through many of the cities of Israel, but when they reached Mount Zion on top of which Jerusalem is located, God stopped them. Until there and no further they could go. God has a clear limit in mind, and even though we do not see this, when anyone crosses this line, he will be cut down like with an axe.
