# Isaiah 18
*Isaiah 18 (NIV)* 

**A Prophecy Against Cush**
*1 Woe to the land of whirring wings*
*along the rivers of Cush,*
*2 which sends envoys by sea*
*in papyrus boats over the water.*

The woe is now sent across continental borders. It was sent to Israel and Judah (in other books), their neighboring countries—their cousins by Esau (Edom) and relatives of the sons of Noah (Shem and Japheth)—and now even to the further continent of Africa (by Noah's third son Ham). #todo/opzoeken  Ham was first or third child?
In the future warnings in Revelations will spread to the European continent, to Greece and perhaps to Rome and Spain. I am wondering if Asia is in the Bible somewhere and how the warning to other continents such as Australia and America is depicted. 
#todo/opzoeken  Where does Moab come from?

*Go, swift messengers,*
*to a people tall and smooth-skinned,*
*to a people feared far and wide,*
*an aggressive nation of strange speech,*
*whose land is divided by rivers.*

Is this a stereotypical and racist slur or people from Cush, which is (part of) Ethiopia? On the one hand it is giving two compliments on their looks and their reputation, but it is giving a critique or observation on their culture. Being tall and smooth-skinned are good things, no one would object to that. "Being feared far and wide" shows their military prowess, which—especially in that time—is a compliment. 
"Strange speech" is not stereotyping, the Cushian language most probably was not known throughout the Middle Eastern world, unlike Aramaic or any of the other languages spoken by the world dominators at that time, i.e. the Assyrians and the Babylonians, or even the Egyptians. 
The best argument, however, is that God is writing these things. Even if "aggression" is stereotyping a people, God is by definition saying the truth. The Cush were an aggressive people. Whether they still are now, I do not know, but this shows that it is possible to say of a *whole* people that it is aggressive. 

#todo/opzoeken  What did the Egyptians speak before the Arabic invasion and when did hieroglyphs come into existence? When did the great pharaoh of Gizeh live, compared to the Biblical timeline? Also, look up more about Joseph's possible existence in Egyptian history. 

*3 All you people of the world,*
*you who live on the earth,*
*when a banner is raised on the mountains,*
*you will see it,*
*and when a trumpet sounds,*
*you will hear it.*

Everyone hears or sees a clear signal. But as mentioned in the previous chapter, Isaiah 17, they do not see the message that God gives them? It is not because God has hardened their hearts, but because they are listening to their hearts and their own will more than to God's. 
God is telling them to stop invading and looting other countries, but their own hearts are telling them to make their own nation greater and to get many wives and slaves. This is why they ignore God's message.

*4 This is what the Lord says to me:*
*“I will remain quiet and will look on from my dwelling place,*
*like shimmering heat in the sunshine,*
*like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”*

And this is why God is silent. He will exert His power and execute His punishment on the peoples of this world. But since they have ignored Him, He will no longer give them warnings anymore than through His prophet Isaiah, which is through this letter. 
But in the mean time God is not doing nothing. He is like shimmering heat. The heat is getting hotter and the dew is rising. These should be signals clearly enough. 
Even when God is silent He is still warning people of this world of what is coming. Even when they do not want to know Him, He shows (cf. Romans 3) and gives them miracles. 
#todo/opzoeken  God lets it rain on both the good and bad. 
The signals are the many messages coming from across the nations of the invasion of the Assyrians. The heat of the battle is closing in and it is only a matter of time before the Assyrians invade Cush. Why would the Cush be safe? Only because of the distance? 
#todo/opzoeken  Until where did the Assyrian army reach? Is this part of Isaiah about Assyria or Babylonia? 

*5 For, before the harvest, when the blossom is gone*
*and the flower becomes a ripening grape,*
*he will cut off the shoots with pruning knives,*
*and cut down and take away the spreading branches.*

God is in time. His time is the perfect time, for anything He does is perfect. There is no better way. He will not let anything die that does not need to die. "Need", however, must be seen in a specific context. A *perfect* time does not mean the result is perfect. Maximizing timing and perfection still does not mean perfection has been obtained. Perfection can only be obtained with perfect tools in perfect circumstances and humans, as we all know, are far from perfect. 
See the next illustration to get an example of perfect timing. 

#todo Example, during a robbery, hostages are held and one is killed every hour if the robbers' demands are not met. The police is gathering the right people and preparing the team to break in and save the hostages, but if they do this without enough preparation, many or all of the hostages may die. On the other hand, if they wait too long, they hostages will die one by one. 
When is the exact time to break in? 
One must realize that there is never a good result in this question. There may be a perfect answer, up to the millisecond, but the result will never be good, because of the situation that people are in. 
So it is with God. God knows the exact time He has to intervene, His answer is perfect, but the result is far from perfect. But realize that no better result can ever be possible than using God's method. If people are to get free will and exercise this, God can only exercise His influence through the free will of others. 
God waits long enough to punish the wicked people of a country in order to maximize the number of people to repent, but He does not wait too long in order to minimize the number of people that are oppressed by the wicked. 
There was a perfect solution without casualties, but free will changed the rules of the game. 

*6 They will all be left to the mountain birds of prey*
*and to the wild animals;*
*the birds will feed on them all summer,*
*the wild animals all winter.*

God will cut off the parts of the people, He will *prune* His branch so that the rest will not die. **Some need to die so that others can live or else the whole branch will die.** This is one of the first principles we need to keep in mind when we analyze history from God's point of view. His punishments might seem cruel, but they were necessary in order for the people (the Israelites and other peoples) to survive. 
The Israelites especially would have been extinct a few days (or perhaps even less) after arriving in the desert, wanting to return home to Egypt out of lack of food and water. Those who returned might have been killed by the Egyptians. Those who remained in the desert would be too few to form a new nation with, considering inbreed and minimum number of people to start a new and healthy population. 
If not for food or water, they would have been extinct by their own desire to worship idols. The Israelites are known by their God and without this God they would have merged with the Egyptians. I am only up to Exodus so far! There are many times when the Israelites were on the brink of extinction because they were following other gods.
When God prunes, not only will the main branch and the good branches not die, they will also grow better and carry more and better fruit. That is the second principle. **God punishes for us to increase in quality, not quantity.** Those with disbelief will hold back those who belief, if only because those who believe must explain so much to the disbelievers, but also in decision making, they would need to convince so many to make the right decision, such as in the case of Joshua and Caleb, who needed to convince the whole congregation to follow God. 
Or take my own example in my previous church. I needed to convince my own church leaders to allow the DISC course, so that people would know how to appreciate each other. I needed to convince them to start a 40-day campaign so their Silent Times and relation would be boosted again. How did that impact growth? The leadership did heavy damage to the growth of my previous church out of disbelief. They had a belief in God but not in what was best for the people.
I have not been around to see what happened after our former pastor decided to move on to a new church for I too left the congregation for another church where I could be of more use.
A third principle is. **Those who die are food for those who prey on Christians.** There will always be people who use God's Name to proclaim their own truths. Those who have been cut off and have never known God, those who say they were "religious" or are "former believers" have become atheists instead and try to convince the world of it. They convince the world to go *for* atheism and *against* Christianity. 
This group is getting greater by their own evangelization, but also by the ones "cast out" of the churches. Perhaps not casted out by people, but by their own unbelief.
In other words, after pruning we become stronger, but so does the enemy. We need a stronger enemy, however, to become stronger ourselves. 

*7 At that time gifts will be brought to the Lord Almighty*
*from a people tall and smooth-skinned,*
*from a people feared far and wide,*
*an aggressive nation of strange speech,*
*whose land is divided by rivers —*
*the gifts will be brought to Mount Zion, the place of the Name of the Lord Almighty.*

At that final moment, at the end of the world, though I hope it will be before the end of it, even from this aggressive nation, gifts will be brought to God in Jerusalem. For our age this could be translated not into aggressive people *per se*, which would be the Hindu and Islamic people where violence is rule, such as the people of Pakistan, Nepal, India and the Middle-East, but also where a different form of violence and intolerance is taking place, that is in the West where freedom of speech is increasingly prohibited for Christians by the Left, which are only growing. 
But fortunately we may know that all this will come to an end. Jerusalem will be the final place. Though Mount Zion will is not meant literally here, for Jesus said that at "that" time—although I do not know whether He is referring to the same time—people will worship Him from all over the world, it is one place for sure where the God of all nations will be worshipped.
