# Isaiah 16
**Isaiah 16:1-5 (NIV)**
*1 Send lambs as tribute*
*to the ruler of the land,*
*from Sela, across the desert,*
*to the mount of Daughter Zion.*
*2 Like fluttering birds*
*pushed from the nest,*
*so are the women of Moab*
*at the fords of the Arnon.*

If anyone had told me that the women of Moab were not guilty, I would not have believed them or accepted that as a valid excuse. The argument of Leftist people would probably have been that women were in inferior positions and had no choice but to obey their husbands in performing idolatrous practices. Also, in societies of that time there was no freedom of religions, just like there is not in India, Nepal and many other countries. So because of the social pressure, and because they did not know any better, especially those who had never been abroad to Israel or Jerusalem to see Jews, they are—in a sense—innocent. 
I would not have accepted this argument. But it is Isaiah speaking the Word of God here, and Isaiah is saying that these women are like birds who cannot even fly yet. Granted, they are not newborn, they can flutter, so they can do a bit, but not enough to fly or stand on their own. That indeed is true of women. It was very hard for a single woman without a family or husband to survive on her own. 
If it is God saying to accept these fugitives, then I have to accept these fugitives. Is God saying here to accept all fugitives? I do not know. The argument is for the (innocence of the) women. 
I have mixed feelings about letting men in. Let us leave out the children in the argument, that is, let us assume that if the women are innocent, the children are even more so. Arguments for accepting the fugitive men as well are as follows. 
Single women in Israel at that time had a hard time surviving. Now add to that the care of children, being a foreigner and the time of war and scarcity and there is a deadly mix. Though women in Israel were not simply taken as slaves, because of its judicial system, which functioned less well, I presume, during times of war and in periods that a bad king rules the country, but overall should protect women, they were still prone to finding a husband just in order to let them and their children. However, they probably had husbands in their own country. This meant that they would either starve to death or break the marital covenant. 
Arguments for not accepting the fugitive men would be these. In cases of both men and women, bringing in fugitives means bringing in their culture and gods as well. If the primary culture and majority of the people is big enough, and spiritually strong enough in their shoes, a few fugitives would not influence the mass, and in the theoretical case where Judaism and Christianity are practiced correctly these would rather influence the fugitives into converting into Jews or Christians, respectively. 
Israel, however, was in a spiritually bad state. Education of the Bible was limited to only a few (and people were probably not interested due to the state of war and their hunger), there were lots of other idolatrous influences (which is (most probably) also one of the reasons why Israel got attacked by Assyria—if I remember correctly the places of worship in the high places (i.e. for other gods) had not all been removed yet)—and poverty was not an issue of concern for most people, due to the moral regression as a result of following other gods. 
Part of the above statements are speculations yet based on logical reasoning. Assuming I am correct, though, the influx of idolatrous Moabite fugitives would severely blow a deal on Jewish moral values and religion. The Jews were even prone to returning to the gods from Egypt and of their neighbors, when there were no foreigners in their country, let alone what would happen if the idolaters were living among them!

**The link with Syria**
The link with present day Europe is very clearly seen. There is a country full of idol worshippers, i.e. Muslims—although they technically do not create any idols (statues), but their god is to Jews and Christians an idol—full of people who want to flee their country and find solace in (western) Europe. Syria is the country I am speaking of.
Should we let the Syrian fugitives in our countries? Our countries are spiritually on the verge of breaking. Less than ten percent claims to be a Christian and even less are truly professing the Christian faith. 
Or should we let only Christians in, who would then have to abandon their families if these families were not Christians but Muslims or atheists? Though familial relationships are not as bonding as marital ones, it still would not give a good example of Christian love which the non-believers especially need to see. Yes, they would severely hamper our Christian growth and increase the growth of their own religion, Islam, but we would get much more opportunities to evangelize and show our love in this way. 
I cannot interpret this verse in Isaiah as applicable to every war and every influx of fugitives, but the question is, should I? 
Should we do that at the cost our own countries, in the same way the Left is afraid of doing so because they have enough problems at the moment? 
Almost every country has and will have enough problems. That should not be a reason for not accepting and helping fugitives. 
I do not have strong arguments for that. Only my prophetic view which I have written above here, is my testimony of what God has told me, and I feel that we should help out Syrians, both Muslim and Christian. As for other wars, we will need to ask God then, or better said, He will tell us then.

*3 “Make up your mind,” Moab says.*
*“Render a decision.*
*Make your shadow like night—*
*at high noon.*
*Hide the fugitives,*
*do not betray the refugees.*
*4 Let the Moabite fugitives stay with you;*
*be their shelter from the destroyer.”*

Isaiah is asking Israel to make up her mind on the one hand, but on the other hand he is urging her to hide the fugitives. This is a decision she only can make, just like God gives us free choice, but it does not mean that every choice is correct. 

*The oppressor will come to an end,*
*and destruction will cease;*
*the aggressor will vanish from the land.*

Hiding these refugees will not be forever. God promises that the oppressor will come to an end. We must understand that even for these immoral people the oppression is serious and devastating. 
Even though they have no feelings for God or subtle sensitivity needed to understand His law and love Him and others, they can feel grander emotions such as pain and fear. They too, after all, are humans, created after God. 

*5 In love a throne will be established;*
*in faithfulness a man will sit on it—*
*one from the house of David —*
*one who in judging seeks justice*
*and speeds the cause of righteousness.*

It is only when we show love to these people that a throne will be established. Of course, God establishes His throne with or without us, and He does it with love. But we are not helping in bringing others to His throne if we do not show them our love. 
Like the Jews, the want this throne established, but they did not want other peoples to participate in it or have any share of it. 
If we want to "establish" a Christian country or make a Christian country out of existing countries, we need to show that what we do is out of love. The whole Left are motivated by love, at least in their thoughts, and that is what can convince them to support Christians as well. 
For example, abortion, racism (affirmative action, the *fictional* celebration day for black people, *Kwanzaa*), LGBT, all are implemented or proposed out of an *intention* of love for those people and especially minorities. It is unfortunate that the Left has wrong moral values, a lack of knowledge and that they use the wrong methods (silencing people and using violence and forcing people to pay for abortions and forcing business to make what they desire, even if it contradicts with their own conscience. In other words, they are forced to say and write something, which is a violation of the First Amendment #tags/politics/amendments/first of freedom of speech. 
But in general the motivation of leftists are still love, except for the latter example of forcing a Christian baker to create a cake for a gay wedding and then suing him for not creating one. That one is purely out of hate for Christians. 
But once again, if we want to reach the nations, it will and must be out of love and we show that by accepting the fugitives. 

Now the question arises again, should we accept every fugitive? The Bible does not speak of setting strict rules for immigrants and fugitives. It does always say that we should be good to foreigners and not let them go hungry, and accept them as our fellowmen. 
But it is no longer saying anything about letting them in, in general, only that when they are already in our country, we should be good to them. 
Furthermore, even present day Israel does not simply allow everyone to enter the country for migration for the same reasons as stated previously. It is too small a country with too small a population and it could be easily disrupted in her growth. 
It is for the same reasons that God had His laws and put death penalties on breaking these laws. 
I am wondering if these death penalties should still be valid. Of course my opinion is that it should, because God's Law is forever valid, although that would be hard in a state where there is separation between state and religion. 

*6 We have heard of Moab’s pride —*
*how great is her arrogance!—*
*of her conceit, her pride and her insolence;*
*but her boasts are empty.*
*7 Therefore the Moabites wail,*
*they wail together for Moab.*
*Lament and grieve*
*for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth.*

Moab was proud and arrogant, but there was nothing to be proud of. The country has not achieved anything great, I do not remember any great battles it has won. Yes there is one, where the Israelites fled, perhaps out of fear, but it was only after they had destroyed Kir Hareseth already.
Back then they might have proud—even if they were deceiving themselves—of having defeated the Israel, but now there is nothing they can bring up anymore. The casualties are too many. They are so badly beaten that they are even willing to put aside their pride and beg Judah to take them in.

*8 The fields of Heshbon wither,*
*the vines of Sibmah also.*
*The rulers of the nations*
*have trampled down the choicest vines,*
*which once reached Jazer*
*and spread toward the desert.*
*Their shoots spread out*
*and went as far as the sea.*
*9 So I weep, as Jazer weeps,*
*for the vines of Sibmah.*
*Heshbon and Elealeh,*
*I drench you with tears!*
*The shouts of joy over your ripened fruit*
*and over your harvests have been stilled.*

Not only the people, but the land too has been destroyed. The beautiful land and the choicest vines that not only looked good, but tasted good as well. It is sad, because it is beauty that has been destroyed, and beauty is something that God has created. 
Inherently man will feel sadness when beauty is destructed, whether it is beautiful person, a painting or a car or a meal. Beauty means that effort has been put into it. A beautiful body is partly the result of effort, of healthy eating and lots of exercise. But aside from man's effort, it is the work of God who gave this beautiful person the right proportions in its body and face. 
As for paintings and cars, though man made this, it still is God Who gave man the abilities to create such things and the inspiration and the talent of creativity to create such wonderful beautiful masterpieces.
Literally *everything* is created *by* God and *for* God (cf. Colossians 1:16).

*10 Joy and gladness are taken away from the orchards;*
*no one sings or shouts in the vineyards;*
*no one treads out wine at the presses,*
*for I have put an end to the shouting.*

God can take away gladness. He knows how, because He created gladness. He sow big things like death and destruction, but he can also take away the little things that make people happy, such as taste and beauty. 
God is sad and it is time for us people to feel His sadness, although we will never fully comprehend the fullness of His sadness. 

*11 My heart laments for Moab like a harp,*
*my inmost being for Kir Hareseth.*
*12 When Moab appears at her high place,*
*she only wears herself out;*
*when she goes to her shrine to pray,*
*it is to no avail.*

God also wants the people of Moab to realize it is futile to go to her own gods. What does it take to let the Moabites know that there are no gods and that there is only One God in Heaven above? The passed disasters were not enough and apparently the silence from their own gods is not enough too, for after all these events the Moabites did not convert and repent and were ultimately either taken captive or killed by the Babylonians.
#todo/opzoeken  Wat is er gebeurd met de Moabieten?

*13 This is the word the Lord has already spoken concerning Moab. 14 But now the Lord says: “Within three years, as a servant bound by contract would count them, Moab’s splendor and all her many people will be despised, and her survivors will be very few and feeble.”*

Though we all know this happened and that this is proof that God's Word is always true and will always come true, many here today still do not heed the warnings given to them and they do not fear the consequences. They think they can handle the consequences and that they can will deal with it, but they are far from the truth. The Moabites thought so too, but look at them wailing now. They thought the invasion of the Assyrians was all, but God let another power come that was much greater, the Babylonians and then the Moabites regretted, for they did not expect such cruelty nor did they expect it would happen to them. 
God can make *anyone* in this world regret their actions, but whether they regret it before they get their last chance, that is the question.
