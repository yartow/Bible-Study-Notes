# 1 Peter 3 (ESV) 
***Wives and Husbands***
::*1 Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives, 2 when they see your respectful and pure conduct. 3 Do not let your adorning be external—the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear—*::

Why would God have given mankind beauty in their outer appearance? Why did he not make people just like animals who all look beautiful. There are hardly any dogs with glasses and all dogs and horses, for example, look beautiful. Even insects, although some would disagree, are amazing looking creatures and not one looking better or worse than the other. 
Unfortunately we do see differences with domesticated animals, dogs which are bred into ugly looking Mexican dogs, for example, or animals that are too fat, such as certain chicken, but cats and dogs as well. It is because of man's sin that there is so much difference. People like smaller dogs and breed them to form just the dog they want. People like having much meat and fat on the bones of the animals they eat and so they breed fat chicken. 
In the same way we have caused our own bodies to deteriorate because of sin. Perhaps we all were healthy and beautiful, as Adam and Eve most definitely were, and most likely the people in the generations after that were still very beautiful as well. If everyone was (just as) beautiful there would be no distinction and people would not distinguish on the basis of external appearance through the braiding of hair, jewelry and clothes. 
So the answer to the question I began with, is that God has given mankind beauty, because He is beauty Himself and He can only create beautiful things. But God never wanted anything to become ugly. When ugliness showed its face through sin, people saw the differences in beauty and people became envious with all due consequences. 
If God has made everyone and everything ugly we would not have had envy, perhaps, but we would not have enjoyed our view on this world, that is of nature, of animals and of people, as much as we do now when we see beauty. 

::*4 but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. 5 For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their own husbands, 6 as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are her children, if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening.*::
::*7 Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.*:: #biblestudy/memorization

***Suffering for Righteousness' Sake***
*8 Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. 9 Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. 10 For*
*“Whoever desires to love life*
*and see good days,*
*let him keep his tongue from evil*
*and his lips from speaking deceit;*
*11 let him turn away from evil and do good;*
*let him seek peace and pursue it.*
*12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,*
*and his ears are open to their prayer.*
*But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”*
*13 Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? 14 But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, 15 but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, 16 having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. 17 For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil.*
*18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, 19 in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, 20 because they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. 21 Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.*
