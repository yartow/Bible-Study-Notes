# Romans 3 (ESV) 
**God's Righteousness Upheld**
*1 Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? 2 Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.* 

Not coincidentally this is the same subject and question I was talking about in the prior devotional. The advantage mentioned here is that they were the first ones to hear about God and receive His revelations. Even more, they were *entrusted* with it. Now in itself the latter does not have any advantages, but everyone knows that when a master, teacher or parent entrusts you with something, it makes you feel proud, because this person trusts you. 

*3 What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? 4 By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written,*
> *“That you may be justified in your words,*  
> *and prevail when you are judged.”*  

The point made here is that God is by no means nullified. None of His characteristics, especially not His faithfulness, are minimized by the Jews' unfaithfulness. It can intuitively be seen that one's faithfulness is dependent on the other party's faithfulness. This goes for everything in life, business, partnerships and marriage. For example, what if a husband pledges loyalty and faithfulness to his wife, but the wife keeps committing adultery? The husband will not be unfaithful to his wife, but he will separate himself from his wife, until she repents. 
God has not become unfaithful, but He has separated Himself from the Jews until they repent. God's Word is true, as are His promises. Even if everyone else lies, God will keep His Word. 
God did not lie, He transparently foretold the consequences of leaving God for idols or what would happen when the Israelites hardened their hearts. 

*5 But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.) 6 By no means! For then how could God judge the world?* 

There are many important points in this part. First, the fact is that when everyone in the world sins, it only contrasts the goodness of God. For no matter how hard He is pressured, He will not sin, just like Jesus showed us on Earth under immense pressure and unrighteousness. Can it be stated then that our unrighteous was "good" or a so-called *necessary evil* to show the goodness of God? If we were not unrighteous, then no one would know the goodness of God. The latter may be true in theory, but in practice no one is righteous.
Unlike some stories or movies where a father introduces some evil in his child's life in order to train the child in such a way that the child will become stronger or see the contrast between real enemies and his strict father, God does not need to do this. There is enough evil in this world already. If anything, He has been withholding evil from our lives. 

Now then comes the human question why God is righteousness in inflicting wrath on us, while we were bringing glory to Him? There is a difference here between you bringing glory or the situation bringing glory. When you do something wrong and God needs to save you and others, it is God Who used the situation to bring glory to Himself. You cannot say that you did something good. No, in fact, you put people in harm's way. That is why you deserve punishment. So God is not wrong if He inflicts harm on you. 

*7 But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?*

As for lying. It is through the many lies that God used people like Josh McDowell to revive the topic apologetics, research what had been written about this in history but also prove once again to many "Christians", agnostics and atheists alike that the claims of God in the Bible are real and true. Did those who lie then contribute to any of this? In part of the equation, the answer is *yes*. Without those lies Josh McDowell would not have given God glory in this way. But in the total equation the answer is *no*, for they have caused so many to fall away, throughout all ages, which is most likely irrecompensable 
by the number of new Christians that are reborn through Josh McDowell's ministry. 

*8 ::And why not do evil that good may come?::—as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.*

This brings us to the question of Buddha asking whether (or stating that) it would be righteous to kill a person if he knew this person would kill others. God has not stated an explicit law for this kind of situation in the Bible, but He has placed similar *situations* within of which we only know the outcome in hindsight. 
Saul was supposed to kill everyone, men, women and children in the war with the Amalekites #todo/opzoeken , as were others in the Bible in certain occasions. Whenever this did not occur, we see the repercussions of this. Joshua did not kill the Gibeonites and later on this people demanded the death of seven of Saul's sons, which would be the end of his whole line except for Mephibosheth.
I am not sure if the Israelites were ever intended to kill all of the Edomites, but that guy in Esther who hated the Jews, was an Edomites, as was Herod, who killed Jesus and who was a traitor for letting the Romans rule Israel. 
But those who used verse 8 were not talking about such situations, and they were [#todo/opzoeken/engels# helemaal al niet] not saying this for a selfless cause   
—out of altruism that is. No, it is the complete opposite. They want to do what they want, no matter how many people get hurt in the process. Then they do not want to accept the consequences, i.e. be punished, but rather protest that either God is unrighteous for punishing them for creating a situation in which He can be glorified, and perhaps they even want the glory for that as well. 
The movie *Unbreakable* shows this plot as well, when Samuel L. Jackson tries to justify his criminal actions to find the superhero. 

**No One Is Righteous**
*9 What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, 10 as it is written:* #todo/opzoeken  waar?
::*“None is righteous, no, not one;*::
::*11 no one understands;*::
::*no one seeks for God.*::
::*12 All have turned aside; together they have become worthless;*::
::*no one does good,*::
::*not even one.”*::
*13 “Their throat is an open grave;*
*they use their tongues to deceive.”*
*“The venom of asps is under their lips.”*
*14 “Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.”*
*15 “Their feet are swift to shed blood;*
*16 in their paths are ruin and misery,*
*17 and the way of peace they have not known.”*
*18 “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”*

Note very carefully that this is not only meant for Jews or for the bad Jews. No, it is for everyone, Jews, Greeks and Christians alike—about our flesh-like state. 

In everyone, both Jew and heathen, all of the above statements are valid. These statements are no small matters. They are accusing of killing people. 
Their feet are swift to shed blood. Does that not mean that we are not only willing, but easily willing to kill people? 
Perhaps even worse, we put people in ruin and misery, and let them suffer their whole lives. Now we can think of some bad people responsible for those actions, like politicians and mighty people such as George Soros, who bought up businesses to sell them afterwards for a huge profit. 
Then what about their throat being an open grave with mouths being full of deception, and curses and bitterness? 
These are not directly killing, but they have a tremendous effect on people's lives. Bullying and verbal abuse for example will cause people's character to change and the whole course of their life. If these do not cause depressions in one's life then they will cause some kind of sociopathic behavior. 

*19 Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God.* 

No arguments are possible for God's infallible reasoning. The law is enough proof of man's sin. Man could provide many arguments to prove his innocent in the case of many transgression's, but never for all—and that is what matters here. Even one sin alone could send one to hell. But even more so, it deems one *accountable to God* and *that* is what man should know. 
So, summarizing, man has nothing to say about his accountability to God. He is the only one they should be accountable to.

*20 For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.*

The law is not a method or way to be justified, first of all because no one can keep all of the law, but second of all because whatever transgression you had which was not sin because you were not aware of it, now *becomes* sin because you have been made aware of it by the law. 

**The Righteousness of God Through Faith**
*21 But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— 22 the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe.*

Now God still provides a way to get to Him, and though it is not *through* the Law, the Law and the prophets, who proclaimed the Law, are part of the plan. The plan is, as we all know, through faith in Jesus Christ. 
Now in what way would the Law and the Prophets be involved? The Prophets indicate the books of the small and big prophets here, and in those books the Law was proclaimed to the people of Israel, and other nations, and the consequences of not following it or setting your heart on God. 
It is through the Law that we can see how sinful we are and therefore we see how great the forgiveness is of God. A reading of the Law alone as in the books of Moses would not suffice in our understanding of the gravity of our transgressions.

We would think per Leviticus that the sin of the people amounts to the sacrifice of bull, while the sin of a leader amounts to that of a goat.
But we need the warnings of Jonah and the wailing of Jeremiah, and among others the suffering of Joel and Ezekiel to show how serious grave the punishment is for us. The Jews kept thinking they were not as bad as the Babylonians or the Assyrians, but Paul is saying here in Romans that they are, everyone is!
We also need the prophets and the Law to show that atonement is the only to get closer to God and the prophets point us to the Messiah who makes all of this possible. 
Personally, I have not been able to find passages about the Messiah coming to forgive us all, only that the Messiah will be powerful and rule with an iron scepter and that He will be sacrificed like a lamb (cf. Psalm 2 and Isaiah 51). The sacrifice mentioned here, however, does not say specifically that it is for the sin of man. On the other hand, I am not a theologian and I have not studied the whole Bible yet. #todo/opzoeken foretellings of the Messiah.

*For there is no distinction: 23 ::for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,::*  #biblestudy/memorization *25 whom God put forward as a ::propitiation:: by his blood, to be received by faith.*

God put something forward as propitiation to Himself. That is like telling someone what to buy for one's own birthday. That alone in itself is a strange thought, but what if this person even pays for his own present? Now this happened in the case of Zeus, who put forward a beautiful white bull to be offered to him by king Minos and he was furious when it was not offered. The reason for offering, however, was because he wanted to be worshipped, which was what kept the gods alive. Zeus did not case about king Minos at all. 
This is the big difference between Zeus and God. God does care about human beings, so much so that he did not *create* a perfect animal to be offered, but He sacrificed Himself (because God does not do wealth creation. If He did, it would have been an easy sacrifice for Him). And after He offered Himself to all humans, the thing He was angry about was not that He had to die, but that some did not even want to *accept appeasement* with God! 
He died so that mankind could be united with God but most of mankind does not even want unity. Those who do not want it then try to influence and convince the few remaining people who do want it, and when that does not succeed they create a web of lies—almost literally, in the *world wide web* of the Internet—and spread lies about God, Jesus, Jews and all of history, even in science—just to remove any evidence of God's presence. 

Now all that God asks us in return for receiving this propitiation, is faith—faith in that Jesus is righteous and that God has saved us through His Son Jesus and that His salvation covers all sins and is everlasting. Is that so hard? 
Would it be like receiving a car only upon having faith that this car is faster than all other cars? That is a hard thing to believe, but still it is different from what God asks of us. For in the case of salvation we ask God for eternal life, which already is something impossible and non-existent according to the secular world. God then says, *if you want me to give you eternal life, the least you have got to do is* believe *that I can give it.*

#todo/opzoeken Make list of statements that say that Jesus is God, both by Himself and by His disciples. 

*This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine ::forbearance:: he had passed over former sins. 26 It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.*

Why is it so hard to see that God is fair. Why does the whole world think that God is unfair for not saving everybody but that instead He *requires* something. They already find it strange that Jesus had to die for us, while God could have just wiped away our sins. That is because they do not understand the logic of consequences and payments. But aside from that, even after Jesus has died, why does God not give this offer to everyone? God has indeed selected a few, but that is outside the scope of this question. What they really want to know is why God does not simply provide his offer to everyone and then everyone will be saved, whether or not they have given their lives to Jesus Christ or even have faith in them. 
::The first answer to this question is answered in our own lives. Do we do things for others when they do not believe in us?:: #todo nog af te maken 

Another related answer is, is why God would let anyone in heaven to live with Him if this person does not even want to live with God? 
Another reason is that God only allows people of good character in heaven. Now no one has a good character, except for the Father, but God can still accept the imperfect characters and make them perfect when they arrive in heaven. Can he not do this then with people who do not believe in him? Many have good characters according to the standard of this world, although many have very bad characters either. If God loves them, why can He not give them the free gift of eternal life, for which He has already paid? The answer is love. It is exactly *because* God loves them that He does not want to force people to go into heaven when they do not want to. Here on Earth the question has already been asked of them whether they want to go to heaven. Is there any atheist who says he wants that? Is there any atheist who says he wants to be with God all of his life? If there is, they why does he not start doing so right now? 
::Now what if an atheist says he does not want to know God, but if—it appears—that in the second after his death he comes to find that the Bible was true after all, and he repents of not having known God, will God then forgive Him?:: #todo nog af te maken #biblestudy/questions  Misschien is het antwoord dat je nog je lichaam kunt trainen en testen zolang je nog een lichaam hebt. In de hemel is dat niet meer mogelijk. Een ander antwoord is dat als je in de hemel bent er geen platform is waar je nog kunt kiezen tussen de hel of de hemel. De rijke man in de parabel met Abraham, zat in een domein van waar hij niet meer naar de hemel kon. Vanaf de dood is het een Y-splitsing. 

The answer as far as I can get this from the Bible is *no*, because God thinks people have had plenty of opportunity to repent. Either without the Bible they would have known what is bad, and with the Bible they would have had enough situations in which they could feel the love of God or perceive the logic of God. It is like an evolutionist who at some point in his career sees that his theory of evolution does not fit the results and starts doubting the validity. If at that point—and God is the judge of whether that doubt is strong enough to give rise to a consideration of alternative theories—he does not give in to this doubt as a *rational* thinker—for he is an evolutionist and therefore claims to be and must be rational—he forfeits this chance of knowing God. He might get more chances in life, God is very merciful, but it still is one chance he has forfeited. 

*27 Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.*

**Example.** Man who is claimed innocent by judge who puts guilt on his own actually innocent son (i.e. Jesus). Will this man have fame? Of course not. The journalists outside the court will despise him but the judge as well. 
Example of "cosmic child abuse" quoted from atheist. #todo/nogaftemaken  #church/material/sermon

The question posed here in verse 27, "*By what kind of law"*, means that when one says it is not acceptable to be boasting, this means that one has to provide a reason for that. So when I tell you you should not boast, I will also tell you why, and that is, for example, because there is someone who can do it even better than you can, or because you cheated, so it does not count. Here we also see the word "count" and one might ask again, *according to whom does this not count?* The same goes for verse 27. Why is boasting excluded? Because of the law of faith.
Now that does not really answer the question, most certainly not for unbelievers. The premise here is that some have been justified, i.e. their sins have been removed. Now if one has had faith and done works in in his lifetime, God sees both and accepts this faith as sufficient to grant you justification and eternal life. He did not consider the amount of works as a payment for your salvation. 
It would be just like handing in two exam papers, both with the same name. Let us say the first one was done by someone else, but the second was done by you. The first one passes the test while the second one does not. You cannot boast about passing when the test was not done by you. Now in this case God sees our faith and that passes the test, and our works never pass the test, because that is literally impossible. So we cannot boast in our works.
Can we then boast in our faith? No, neither can we do that for it is God Who works in us to act and to will (cf. Ephesians 2:10 #todo/opzoeken ) and even our faith is imputed unto us. 
#church/material

*28 For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. 29 Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,*

Another question is asked here that starts with "or". This is a rhetoric question to prove that God is the God of Gentiles as well. Now what does that have to do with justification? It is connected to what is said in the previous verse. It is the second reason why boasting is excluded. 
This reason is that it would not be fair for Gentiles to compete in this race. Gentiles would not be able to boast in their works of the law, because they do not have the law that Jews have. Yes, as mentioned before, they have their own law, the law written on their hearts, by which they will be judged, but the law by which they should be justified is the Law of Moses, c.q. the Law of God. 
So if boasting in the Law was not excluded (by faith) then the Jews could boast in their works, but only because the Gentiles did not have this work. This would be like boasting in the results of your exam while you have your books to learn from but others do not. Passing your exam then is hardly something to boast about. Then again, everyone would fail this exam, for no one would be able to achieve all the works possible. 

*30 since God is one—who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. 31 Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.*

What does verse 29 have to do with the Trinity of God? This unity refers not to the tri-unity of God but of the unity between people. God is also one in that He treats people in the same way, as verse 30 explains. 
Verse 31 then concludes that if the law is not used to justify anyone, then why do we have it?
