# Romans 15 (ESV) 
**The Example of Christ** 
*1 We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves.* 

We have to bear with the failings of the weak. What would be the opposite of bearing? Bear requires a lot of patience, what comes to mind is anything that does not require patience, such as getting food right now, like fast food instead of healthier food, or even slower food when one makes it himself. What else requires bearing? Irritating behavior of our fellowmen. 
In everything that we bear, we are not pleasing ourselves. Paul says it rightly, pleasing ourselves is the opposite of bearing with another, especially bearing with the *failings of the weak*. Now it is bad enough to bear with another person, because there so many differences between people—which is not wrong, but among others DISC and enneagrams explain the differences in personalities and how one would avoid fights and is rather peacekeeping, but another would confront it to solve things quickly—but bearing the *failings*, which is a fault, and even more so, that failings *of the weak* is even worse—and opposite all of that is the pleasing of ourselves. 
Why does God command us to do this? Pleasing ourselves is not wrong in and of itself, but it does not train us for harder work, just like resting is not wrong, but one does not get stronger by it. 
So we do not become stronger and neither does our neighbor get any closer to God. But when the two of us come together and when the stronger Christian shows his love and bearing, the weaker one, whether Christian or not, will see and feel God's love for him and mature, and so will the Christian—at the cost of his own pleasure. 
There is ample pleasure in heaven, let us work now, and relax later. It is not as if God asks us never to relax. We have received the Sabbath from God as a *gift*, to rest and to worship God—it is a gift, we cannot take it for granted. God could have forced us to work seven days a week—but at the same time we cannot discard it either. A gift from a respectable person with wisdom or king is never thrown away, and from One Who is both and even more, this gift should be used for it was given for a reason. 

*2 Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up. 3 For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.”* 

God had a plan when He wrote the Scriptures. It has multiple layers for multiple purposes. He wrote it for the first hearers, such as the people of Israel so that they would know the Law; for the people in later generations, so that they would know history; for the lawmakers and other leaders, to know what is wisdom; for personal use, so that each can know God and feel Him; of course it is also for the world, to let them know Who God is, Who created the world and for what purpose, namely to send His Son and to save them; and for His Church, so that they have hope when doing the difficult things in life. 
One piece or story in the Bible could have several purposes. The story of Jesus, i.e. the Gospel, lets us know that we are saved through Him, but it also tells us to be like Him and to bear with the failings of others. Furthermore, it also gives us strength in doing that. It gives us strength because it tells us that everyone that the pain we bear is borne by Him. It is more than just giving an example. It is not like when I tell my son: "Look at me, people are reproaching me incorrectly, but I am gentle, and so you must be as well." It is rather the like following example: "Be gentle like I am, and every time they reproach you, I will bear the pain." Would that not give you immense strength and courage to do anything? 
It is like you go out and attack the villains and every bullet that is shot at you is felt by Jesus, but not you. On one hand you would be fearless and do all the good you want, but on the other hand you would try to minimize the hurt, because you know Someone is going to pay for it. 
Some people would rather not go out, not out of fear of being hurt, but because they do not want Jesus to be hurt. There is something these people do not realize. First of all, Jesus could feel all of the hurt, when He was human, and now He still feels hurt, but the hurt He feels, is not because of sticks and stones, or even words, but because people reject Him. He is sad in two ways when one person attacks another: because the attacker does not obey Jesus and because the victim is suffering and Jesus is suffering with Him because of His compassionate heart. 
If we do not go into battle Jesus would be suffering two times, because if the attacker does not attack us, he will attack someone else. But if we do go into battle, there is a chance that this attacker might have a change of heart and if he does, Jesus will be suffering less for it. 
However, if we return our attacks towards this attacker, Jesus will be suffering four times, for the same amount of hurt that was done the first time, is now towards the other person. 
So therefore, when someone attacks you, enter the line of fire and do not fear, for it is the only way to approach the other, and when you are near him, open your heart towards the other and love him, and the more you are hurt be stay gentle, the bigger the odds the other will hurt you less and be changed. 

#stories/bible/idea 

*4 For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.* 



*5 May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus, 6 that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 7 Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.* 

Everything we do has one purpose and that is that we have harmony with one another. How marvelous that is! It is so marvelous because God always has a plan. In *The A-Team* #tags/movies Hannibal always says: "I love it when a plan comes together" and even though we expected him to say that, because he always does that at the end of an episode, it still is exciting to see what he has come up with. Now God's plans are even more surprising because He makes plans that span a thousand years or more and then comes up with a twist no one could ever think of, with the ultimate plot twist of sending His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on Earth to bring Jews and Gentiles together. The plan is so intricate that for thousands of years of easter eggs (no pun intended, as easter or Pesach is also referring to Christ's resurrection), some hidden better than others within the typologies of the stories of Abraham and the Exodus, while others are implicitly proclaimed by the prophets of Israel such as Isaiah 53, and some explicitly prophesied by the likes of Daniel—and still no one, except to whom it was revealed, figured out what God had planned, not even when it happened right in front of their eyes. 
It was publicly revealed by God through Paul who then wrote down this mystery in the letter to the Ephesians (chapter 3) so that the whole world could know it. 
So marvelous is this that no has can and ever will establish—and the greatest plot twist is yet to come! 

**Christ the Hope of Jews and Gentiles** 
*8 For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs,* 

If this verse is not written correctly one might interpret this as if Christ has  come to Earth only for the circumcised. First of all, verse 9 needs to be taken into account as well. Second of all, this verse could also be interpreted as follows. 
"I became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness; I became a servant to my parents to show them the fruit of parenthood and the meaning of family; I became a servant to my friends to show what humility is." 
There are multiple reasons why Jesus came, which can be seen in the notes on verse 4 #todo corrigeren? 
We should take the first part of this chapter into context when interpreting this verse, which is implied by the word "for." So this means that we should bear all the failings of the weak because confirm the promises given to the patriarchs and so that the Gentiles will glorify God and become followers of Him of course as well. 
The second reason is extensively supported by the quotes in verse 9 and further, but what does this bearing have to do with the promises to the patriarchs? Those promises to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were about Yahweh being their God and the land of Canaan being their inheritance in return for Israel's faithfulness to God. But what does this have to do with bearing one another? #todo/nogaftemaken It is not directly linked, but it would be strange to inherit a country and then continue fighting with each other as the two kingdoms did. This does not affirm anything to the Gentiles about God's promise. The land might've been split up in ten parts if God didn't intervene, or be taken over, because all these little parts refused to work together. 
Also, it wouldn't show how great God is. So both promises would not be affirmed then. 

*9 and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written,* 
*“Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles,* 
*and sing to your name.”* 
*10 And again it is said,* 
*“Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people.”* 
*11 And again,* 
*“Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles,* 
*and let all the peoples extol him.”* 
*12 And again Isaiah says,* 
*“The root of Jesse will come,* 
*even he who arises to rule the Gentiles;* 
*in him will the Gentiles hope.”* 

God wants to reach the Gentiles and He wants them to glorify Him for His mercy—not just glorifying Him because of His beauty and His strength. Paul already explained in Romans 1:18 and further that God's invisible attributes are already seen by man through the things He made, which is all of the universe and everything here on Earth. But His mercy He revealed through His Son to His people. Greatness can be revealed in what one does by himself, but for mercy a second party is needed. Love is what God the Father could give to His Son and to the Holy Spirit, but mercy He could not, because Jesus never required any mercy nor grace. Only to sinful people can mercy be granted. 
So through the sinfulness of the Jewish people the goodness of Jesus is contrasted and the grace and mercy of God the Father are shown. His mercy is shown in the withholding of eternal death and His grace is shown in providing another chance to them to be reconciled with Him through Jesus Christ. 

*13 May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.* 

But the Lord Yahweh is a God of hope. Through His Holy Spirit He provides us this power to hope. 
Though hope is a powerful thing, one needs a lot of power to obtain it and to contain it. 
**Obtaining hope.** God grants us this hope, it is right before us, free of charge, and one can read about it in the Bible. All it requires is one single step: hand over your life to God, or in other words, put your trust in Him. This means so much as doing something when God asks you to, or not doing it when He tell you to. It means refusing a job, giving up a career or breaking up with a partner with the possibility of not getting a replacement for either of those. 
**Containing hope through faith.** Yes, there is hope in getting a better *alternative* for those things we give up—even when it concerns our *life*—but this hope requires *faith*. 
Now faith as well is a powerful thing. With enough faith it is impossible for man to break you. History has shown that man of faith were unbreakable, even when tortured, on the verge of death or even when their family was killed in front of their eyes. 
**Sustaining hope through faith.** Take for example the [Boxer Rebellion]( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion) ) #tags/historic events# where so many Christian missionaries were killed with not only their family being killed in front of them, but also the long line of other Christian ministers and their families before them. When one sees the body of Christ being slaughtered one by one for hours in a row, people without faith would recant their belief in God in order to be saved. But these missionaries and their families persisted until the end. 
**Remaining faithful through hope.** They never recanted because they knew what was waiting for them in heaven. They never rebelled because they loved the Chinese people and attacking them would only move them farther #todo/opzoeken/engels of further? 
away from God. 
**Gaining joy through hope.** During this period a great number of missionaries fled and the Christian world mourned for the loss of their Christian family as well the loss of the Chinese, because no one reached out to them. A few years before that though, Mrs. Saunders from Melbourne, Australia, lost her two daughters, Elizabeth Maud and Harriette Elinor Saunders, who were missionaries from the Church Missionary Society in China, in another attack by Chinese Buddhists, the [Kucheng massacre - Wikipedia]( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kucheng_massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kucheng_massacre) ), and decided to go instead of her daughters and said the quote 
> *I am sorry I do not have more daughters to send to China*   
She still could find the joy to serve the Lord in this great loss. That is how powerful hope is. It is not something human or even humane, it is supernatural and it can only be obtained from and sustained through the Holy Spirit.

**Paul the Minister to the Gentiles** 
*14 I myself am satisfied about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another. 15 But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder, because of the grace given me by God 16 to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.* 

*17 In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God. 18 For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience—by word and deed, 19 by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God—so that from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ;* 

#biblestudy/questions What is the relationship between verses 17 and 18? Paul says that he has a reason to be proud of his work, and what is this reason? 
What does the "for" in verse 18 refer to? It could refer to the fact that it is *in Christ Jesus* that Paul has a reason to be proud, or to the *pride* or to the *work of God*. The last one seems to be most in line within the context. 
Paul has many things to be proud of, but he only mentions his work for God—and even that is *in Christ Jesus*. Why does he not mention other things he is proud of? He does not explain. He only says that he will not *venture* to speak of anything else. 
It is a strange sentence, because the answer seems to be lacking. It is as if I am saying: "I will talk about my music skills, because I dare not speak of anything else." But why would I not dare to do this? 
The answer seems to become more apparent in the next verse. 

In verse 20 Paul explains that he has already fulfilled the ministry of the Gospel between Jerusalem and Illyricum—which is somewhere in Hungary— #todo/opzoeken  but not further than that. Therefore he makes it his ambition to preach the Gospel in other places where Christ has not been named yet. 

So in short Paul says that he will only speak of his work for God, because he will not venture or dare speak of anything else, because his ambition is to preach the Gospel. 

*20 and thus I make it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on someone else's foundation, 21 but as it is written,* 
*“Those who have never been told of him will see,* 
*and those who have never heard will understand.”* 

Paul gained his ambition from the places where he saw that the Holy Spirit was working, which is in ministering to the Gentiles. However, he adds an extra condition to that and that is that it needs to concern places where they do not know Jesus yet. This extra condition is founded on two arguments: he does not want to build on someone else's foundation and he wants to fulfill the foretelling from the Old Testament from Isaiah 52:15. The argument is not a valid one in and of itself. Why would it be bad to build on someone else's foundation? Did not everyone do that when they continued #tags/famouspeople Hudson Taylor's *China Inland Mission*? 
I am not certain of this, but perhaps it is because of what Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 1:13 about the division occurring between people over who baptized them. Perhaps Paul did not want to have any discussions about whose teaching it was they followed. In a way, Paul would not prevent this problem, but only move it to other persons. If he decided not to minister the people who had already heard of Jesus, then another person would have to do that and then this person would encounter the problems associated with teachings of another which might need to be corrected. 
So I do not understand the first argument. #biblestudy/questions 

**Paul's Plan to Visit Rome** 
*22 This is the reason why I have so often been hindered from coming to you.* 

Paul's reason for being hindered is a valid one. He had his ambition which was motivated by the purpose given to him by God. He knew it was his purpose because he saw that what he did among the Gentiles was blessed. Did he see that the fruit of his work at other places was not blessed? I do not know. As far as I know the Bible does not speak on that, but I can imagine that changing a culture could be harder than introducing one, and changing a religion could be even worse. However, introducing a new religion among the Greeks and other Gentiles is not an easy or safe job either. It seems to me that Paul also liked what he did. He felt that he needed to teach the basic teachings of Christ and even of Judaism. It is what he was a Pharisee for. All pieces fall together. 
He was instructed in academia, many of whom, and in those times perhaps everyone, were to become teachers. So adding his talent to his passion of teaching, his background of being both a Pharisee Jew (who was strict about the Law) and a Christian and the spiritual blessings of signs and wonders and words and deeds (perhaps Paul had these respective gifts as well) it almost forms a perfect S.H.A.P.E. of Spiritual Gifts, Heart, Ability, Personality and Experience—if I had known what his personality is. 
From his writing I cannot extract his personality. My writing, for example, is much different from how I speak, and how I speak also depends on how I have prepared myself for the situation. 
I can trust in God and I have my hope in Him that He has given everyone a perfect SHAPE, but a Romans 8:28 already says, this is only for those who love God. But even for Christians, the only way to know one's SHAPE is to go like Paul did, and experience the wonders that the Holy Spirit gives you, to find out if your passion and ambition lie there and to see if you are suited to do the things you are supposed to do there. 

*23 But now, since I no longer have any room for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you, 24 I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain, and to be helped on my journey there by you, once I have enjoyed your company for a while. 25 At present, however, I am going to Jerusalem bringing aid to the saints. 26 For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem. 27 For they were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings. 28 When therefore I have completed this and have delivered to them what has been collected, I will leave for Spain by way of you. 29 I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.* 
*30 I appeal to you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf, 31 that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints, 32 so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company. 33 May the God of peace be with you all. Amen.*
