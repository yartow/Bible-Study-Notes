# Romans 14 (ESV)
**Do Not Pass Judgment on One Another**
*As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions.* 

It is quite often that I would like to welcome people to have a debate over certain issues, such as apologetic, doctrinal or political. Perhaps that is in the didactic personality I have, but it is more in the drive I have to convince others of what I believe is the truth—or perhaps to convince others that I am right. 
Now I realize that this is not the right way—it is not the right way to evangelize nor is it the right way to build up Christians. Teaching them and inviting them to seminars is another thing. With this in mind they know what they are choosing for and will enter my house with an open mind, but when one is invited for dinner or a movie, he will be surprised by the subjects and will likely feel the need to defend himself. 

*One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables. ::Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him.::*

From *MacSBNnkjv* we obtain a different interpretation of the verb "to pass judgment" as I have written in my notes to verse 4 below, which I will continue there. It is also a perfect response to our current situation with the Coronavirus. We are despising the other or having some kind of other contempt, while they are holding us to be irresponsible and perhaps depraved. 
This is what *MacSBNnkjv* writes:

> *(MacSBNnkjv) “Despise” indicates a contempt for someone as worthless, who deserves only disdain and abhorrence. “Judge” is equally strong and means “to condemn.” Paul uses them synonymously: The strong hold the weak in contempt as legalistic and self-righteous; the weak judge the strong to be irresponsible at best and perhaps depraved.*   

The problem between Christians right now, in the current Coronavirus-crisis is that of letting another take offence

Now usually this only concerns brothers, that is other Christians, with a weaker faith. We can help build them up, by not putting a stumbling block in their and restricting their growth by imposing anything on them which—to God is neither wrong nor right, for it is not wrong to abstain from eating meat nor to eat meat offered to idols—rather than letting them ignore their conscience, which is a bad habit (the latter is also taken from *MacSBNnkjv*).
We would also not purposefully drink alcohol when there is a non-Christian alcoholic, but that has more to do with general love for the other, instead of building up the other person, for the non-Christian has no faith, so there is no faith to build up. It could give a bad image to other Christians, however.
Notice then the following two points: 
1. Refraining from passing judgment is only applicable when the subject matter is neither wrong nor right, and 
2. this is done to build up the fellow Christian's faith or to love the other when it concerns non-Christians and provide a good example of Christ.
With the current issue between Christians where one part says we must stay home (whether it is out of fear or to obey the government) and another says we should still meet as Christian (which is almost always because they obey the Bible, but which could also be out of legalism or irresponsibility) it is hard to say whether this is wrong or right. The only way we can make a distinction here is by having scientific proof and a standard of what is dangerous. 
The thing is, we do not have scientific of the contagiousness #todo/opzoeken/engels besmettelijkheid ? 
of COVID-19 and even if we had it, say it is 30% when a person is in the direct vicinity of 0.5 meters, then what is the threshold for something actually being dangerous? 
We also know that most persons are asymptomatic carriers and that of those who do get symptoms, a large part will recover. But that still does not answer the question, is that part large *enough*. Who decides on that? 

We can say, for example, that if the efficacy of COVID-19 is equal to that of a "yearly" influenzavirus, which means that the contagiousness might be less, but the mortality rate might be higher, in effect causing the same number of deaths, but over a shorter period, would the amount of danger or risk then be the same? And if that is the case, would it then be acceptable to meet each other in churches and ignore the government's instructions? 

On one hand "yes" but on the other hand "no". As for the risk-factor I do not see any arguments anymore why Christians should not meet each other, but there is another factor, and that is that of taking offence to another. It is this for this reason, which is even stronger than other reasons, that we should change our attitude. 
Notice that some laws in the Bible are emphasized more than others and some transgressions have heavier punishments than others. What God wants most of all from us, is this:

Concluding #todo/nogaftemaken 


*4 Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another?*

As for a person weak in faith, it is the same, that is, he will be surprised by our "attacks", but Paul goes on to explain that it is not for that reason but rather for the reason that we should not pass judgment on others who do or think differently than we do.
If we merely think about *judgment* we might think it strange that we are not allowed to judge the one who eats. Most Christians will actually think it is not strange, but for a wrong reason. They will use Paul's last line "*Who are we to judge others?*" and "*Why should we judge anyone for what he is eating?*" They do not understand, however, that this last line is not a rhetorical question perse. It could be rhetorical if you are a mere church member without knowledge of doctrine. But if you were to ask God or a godly priest this question, it would not be rhetorical.
So judging could indeed be done here, but Paul is rather saying that first of all *we* should not be the ones to judge—if we are not in the position—and second of all we should not judge others' servants. So for example, we should not judge a Buddhist for not being a good Buddhist or a good Christian, for he has a different master. 

*It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand.*

Now a new question arises and that is whether Paul is speaking to Christians here with a weak faith or to Jews with stricter dietary rules who essentially have another master. It seems to be clear from this line that it is not about Christians but about people with their *own* master. On the other hand, the next line where it says that God will uphold this person, and verses 6 and 7 seem to indicate that is about Christians. As mentioned before, it would be strange, but not impossible if Paul were to speak of non-Christians in verse 5 and of Christians in the later verses. Remember that he is in prison and all kinds of thoughts are running through his head and he is writing down what he thinks of, without the possibility to interject a few lines between his previous ones such as "Now as for Christians" before verse 5. 
In this case, however, it does not seem to be likely and there is an explanation for the seeming contradictions. 
Paul means to say here that if a fellow Christian with a weak faith stands or falls, he will stand or fall before God, not before us. So we should not be the ones to judge him. That is why a priest and a teacher do have the right to judge, because they are responsible to teach the right things to the people. 
Then if we do not have the right to judge non-Christians, do we have any right to judge Christians at all when we are not in position like that of a teacher or a priest? I am still of the opinion that we should be careful in judging because we cannot read the other person's heart. Also, we can form a judgment about something to know whether it is good or wrong, but we do not necessarily have to tell others or convict them of their faults. I have the feeling Paul should have used the term "convict" (ἐλέγχω) here, but Paul has not used this word for a reason, but rather "to pass judgment" and in the Greek translation we read the word *(kata)krinou* (κρίνω/κατακρίνω) which also means to damn or to condemn (cf. John 8:10 "has no man condemned you?").
Most likely there is a difference between the Dutch and the English translations here, because in Dutch we have a clear distinction between the judgment without the punishment, that is only the ruling, and the punishment itself. So for example, a judgment would be "The verdict is guilty" and the punishment would be brought forward as "I condemn you to three years in state prison" which in Dutch would be "oordeel" and "veroordeling", respectively. It could that in English the verb "to pass judgment" encompasses both of actions at once. 
In any case, we know from the Greek translation that Paul meant that we should not punish a person. This would render the translation of Matthew 7:1 as "do not condemn, so that you will not be condemned".

Will a person always be upheld then? No, not always, but my guess is that when it concerns smaller matters such as eating or not eating, that God will uphold one though his struggle with his conscience.  

*5 One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. 6 The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God.* 

If we are talking about Christians these verses are easily interpretable, but then the question would be why the previous verses would be speaking of non-Christians? 

What is most important here is that we do everything for the Lord and we can do it either by doing something or not doing something, although *not* doing something has to entail some kind of hardship. Not working and resting when you really want to work, is hardship for some, while for others the work itself is the hardship. 
Abstaining from food would be difficult for everyone, although for some more difficult than for others.

*7 For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. 8 For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's. 9 For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.*

Here it is made even clearer that the people Paul speaks to are Christians. 

Jesus never intended that only our lives would be His', He also wanted our *afterlives*, which include our deaths. We should not be afraid of dying, not for ourselves and not even for the thought of our deaths being a waste because we cannot serve the Lord anymore after that. No, even in our death we can be of use as well as after our deaths. Now I do not know how we could be of any use after our death, but just like God uses each person, no matter how helpless, or even someone like Nick Vujicic #tags/famouspeople to bless millions of people, children and teenagers who, though they have a perfectly working body, still have the same thoughts and hurts as he has. Nick wanted to die, but Jesus wanted to use him here on Earth. Hudson Taylor most likely wanted to live, because he still had a lot of (according to him) unfinished work in China, but God wanted him to die—perhaps so that others could take over his work, and it has been many more people after that who have become missionaries. 
If we look at the Torchlighters® series we see that many of those missionaries were inspired by another missionary from the same series, and that it leads back Hudson Taylor. He was one of the first and his sickness #todo/nogaftemaken 
and his death have led to much more result—perhaps more than he has done in his lifetime.  

*10 Why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God; 11 for it is written,*
*“As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,*
*and every tongue shall confess to God.”*
*12 So then each of us will give an account of himself to God.*

**Do Not Cause Another to Stumble**
*13 Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother.*

Very often I have given my wife tests by making it more difficult for her to come to her senses. The other day we had a fight and in my opinion she was wrong for being angry and not wanting to talk about it anymore. I believed she should be taught a lesson. 
I then left the home for some rest, knowing she would not like it, but I did not do that to get back at her. I did it so that she would come to her senses  and think about the wrong that she had done as well. 
Things only got worse afterwards and instead of thinking about her wrongs she only focused on what I did wrong.
However, verse 13 makes me realize that I was passing judgment on her—or in my own words, I was *judging* her and *condemning* her—and putting a hindrance in her way to recovery. Now I am not saying that my judgment was wrong, but Paul clearly tells us not to do that. 
Perhaps the word "rather" even indicates that this passing of judgment—whether the judging or the condemning part—is the same as the hindrance. 

*14 I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean.*

*15 For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died. 16 So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil. 17 For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 18 Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men. 19 So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.*
*20 Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats. 21 It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble. 22 The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who has no reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves. 23 But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.*
