# Lamentations 5 (ESV) 
**Restore Us to Yourself, O LORD**
*1 Remember, O LORD, what has befallen us;*
*look, and see our disgrace!*
*2 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,*
*our homes to foreigners.*
*3 We have become orphans, fatherless;*
*our mothers are like widows.*

The fathers would probably still be present, but during extreme sadness it is as if the people one counts one are gone. Just like Naomi who was depressed and could no longer take care of others and Ruth had to take care of her. Sometimes children have to take care of their parents as well, when their sadness has overcome them and these children are then no better off than orphans or even worse off, because they still need to take care of their parents *and* their siblings if any. 
The same thing goes for the mothers in the cities. Their sadness resembles that of widows who not only have lost their husband, but also their income and struggle with their daily living. 

I am not sure if it is the *disgrace* they are worrying about because of the *inheritance* had been taken by heathens. It would seem to me that they did not care about their Jewish inheritance because they defiled their own temples with statues and objects from other religions. Neither would it be a real disgrace if other nations saw what happened to their God or gods they were so proud of, for other nations were decimated in the same way by the Babylonians. 

*4 We must pay for the water we drink;*
*the wood we get must be bought.*

At this time the Judahites realized how blessed they were, not only to have their own land and freedom within it, but especially in Jerusalem where a natural source of fresh water was located. Now they had to pay for the water to survive, which is like paying for air to breathe. Whereas a country such as The Netherlands is cold and people need lots of fuel for warm their houses in colder periods, which costs money, they do not need to pay for water, as there is plenty of it. Israel, which is in the desert however, needs both water (and more of it as well, for a person in the Sahara would need to drink 8 liters a day) and wood all year round, for it gets very cold in the desert parts of Israel at night. 

*5 Our pursuers are at our necks;*
*we are weary; we are given no rest.*

At such a moment there is no rest at all anymore. If even a cup of water costs money while one has no money left, then what about food on the table or even worse the care for the young ones? In western countries people worry constantly when one gets to be without a job, about how they are going to pay the bills next month. Imagine how much higher the stress level is for those in Jerusalem at that time? They are worrying about the actual lives of themselves and their families, if these had not already been killed by the Babylonians. 

*6 We have given the hand to Egypt, and to Assyria,*
*to get bread enough.*

*7 Our fathers sinned, and are no more;*
*and we bear their iniquities.*

The generation of Jeremia indeed had to bear the consequences of the sin of their father, but so did the children who grew up in Babylon had to bear those of them. In that sense everything is "fair" until there is one generation who has not sinned like the previous one, but still has to bear it. 
In total everything is fair, because Solomon did not bear the consequences of his sin and bore the blessings of his father David, it is, however, not distributed fairly among the generations. This is, at least, how it seems to man in his eyes. We know that God is just and He rules justly. God does not punish those who are innocent. Bearing the consequences of another's sin is not a punishment, it is a harder condition to live in, but at the same time it is open for more challenge and opportunity. 
Take for example people who are born into a situation of poverty and have not chance for an education and whose only way up is to start their own business. Is it punishment for them to have been born in a economically poor area, with poor parents and people surrounding them, such as #todo/opzoeken  Allentown, Pennsylvania or Alabama (see Hillbilly Elegy #tags/movies)? No, but they have chances and more pressure to take those chances than those who have a chance to take the safe path and most likely would do so.  

*8 Slaves rule over us;*
*there is none to deliver us from their hand.*
*9 We get our bread at the peril of our lives,*
*because of the sword in the wilderness.*

The wilderness is not place to get the food, that in itself is like a sword. One will either die because of thirst or because of the wild animals there. But getting bread outside of the wilderness still is done with peril. Perhaps Jeremiah means here those who try to steal bread and risk a heavy punishment, or those who buy their bread for extremely high prices (cf. #todo/opzoeken 2 Kings ).  Either way, bread is no standard commodity anymore and one risks their live both by not eating bread or by getting it. 
In the same way eating the bread of life will cause the same thing. To obtain Jesus' body and be part of it, one must and will die (though this time not risking it, because it is certain, at least spiritually) and to not eat it one will certainly end in death as well. #church/material

*10 Our skin is hot as an oven*
*with the burning heat of famine.*
*11 Women are raped in Zion,*
*young women in the towns of Judah.*

#biblestudy/prophecy/fulfilled What was prophesied in Zechariah 14:2 was fulfilled here. 

*12 Princes are hung up by their hands;*
*no respect is shown to the elders.*
*13 Young men are compelled to grind at the mill,*
*and boys stagger under loads of wood.*

This is the part that is not spoken of in details explicitly in the Bible. The cruelties of the Assyrians and the Babylonians have been described in historical archives, and those of the Egyptians as well, but what happened to the Israelites exactly has not been described in the Bible. The authors, and hence God, must have thought it sufficient to describes all of the afflictions caused to the Israelites somewhat "poetically" as here in Lamentations and in Isaiah for example. Perhaps the historical writers, such as Samuel and Ezra (who wrote his eponymous book, Nehemiah and most likel Kings and Chronicles as well) did not think it to be formal to mention details of the execution or treatment of their enemies for their historical reports. Neither did they mention the details of the afflictions caused to other peoples by the kings of Israel and Judah.

*14 The old men have left the city gate,*
*the young men their music.*
*15 The joy of our hearts has ceased;*
*our dancing has been turned to mourning.*
*16 The crown has fallen from our head;*
*woe to us, for we have sinned!*
*17 For this our heart has become sick,*
*for these things our eyes have grown dim,*
*18 for Mount Zion which lies desolate;*
*jackals prowl over it.*

What is probably meant here with the sick heart is that a person does not have the will to live on anymore. A similar description is being used for the eyes who have grown dim. Young people with the will to live show this in their eyes. It is said that patience and anger can be seen through the eyes. In other words, the eyes show what the heart feels.
Verse 18 explains that the loss of this will to live is not only because of all the affliction caused to them and the depressing situation in the city where old men have left the city, perhaps indicating they have died, and young people lost their joy, but moreover because Mount Zion, the *source* of their hope, is desolate now. 
The situation there is strikingly similar to the situation here in The Netherlands and elsewhere due to COVID-19 lockdowns #tags/historic events/corona#. The old people have not all died, even if we believe the numbers—which are not reliable—but the joy of the land has disappeared. Streets full of music and the sound of people have disappeared and here the churches lie desolate. Instead of jackals on Mount Zion it is the government prowling on the churches to see if there are any attenders and whether they are abiding the new social distancing laws. The only distance is in verse 16: the people of the The Netherlands are now repenting and admitting they have sinned. Rather yet, they are only continuing and aggravating their sin. 
The result for The Netherlands will be much worse than the Babylonian Exile. The exile occurred after this repentance in Lamentations, but if a people continues in its hardness of heart, it might end up like all the other empires such as that of the Assyrians who repented once, in the time of Jonah, but later on continued anyway and were literally wiped off the face of the Earth only to be found a few decades ago *under* Earth after many excavations and perhaps only because the Bible mentioned it. #todo/opzoeken was the name Nineveh known elsewhere? Compare this with Matthew 11:24: ""it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you."

*19 But you, O LORD, reign forever;*
*your throne endures to all generations.*

It is sad to see that Mount Zion lies desolate and that the people of Israel have left their God, but this does not mean that God is not present anymore. God reigns forever and He is still present now for those who have opened their hearts to Him. 

*20 Why do you forget us forever,*
*why do you forsake us for so many days?*
*21 Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may be restored!*
*Renew our days as of old—*
*22 unless you have utterly rejected us,*
*and you remain exceedingly angry with us.*

Jeremiah is pleading with God for mercy but he is doing so respectfully and not crossing the boundary of God's will. In verse 22 he clearly states that God should not even restore us if He remains exceedingly angry with us.
