# Lamentations 2 (ESV) 
***The Lord Has Destroyed Without Pity***
*1 How the Lord in his anger*
*has set the daughter of Zion under a cloud!*
::*He has cast down from heaven to earth*::
::*the splendor of Israel;*::
*he has not remembered his ::footstool::*
*in the day of his anger.*

In this part and in the next verses we see *how* angry and great His wrath is. It is like one who forgets all of his earlier made promises and is only out on revenge and destruction. Imagine a man who made a house or a statue for his wife with his own hands and now destroys it—just like God casts down the splendor of Israel—and it falls down in millions of pieces, never to be made whole again. Even if things are made whole, pieces would be lost, blown away by the wind. Some pieces are too small to be fixated and some pieces need to be cut or shaved, in order for other pieces to be mended.
But in all, the splendor will never be as it was before. It will be like the Venus of Milo, which might look nice, in a different, artistic, way, but missing elementary body parts. Even if she had her arms back, there would be visible traces of where the arms have been glued together. 

God calls Earth His footstool, and this is not a belittling of Israel, but rather an honor. For who could work in God's courts as the lowliest servant, still has a better place than the highest ruler in the best palace on Earth. As David spoke: 
> *"For a day in your courts is better*  
>     *than a thousand elsewhere.*  
> *I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God*  
>     *than dwell in the tents of wickedness."*  

But the Earth is not worthy of being God's footstool anymore. She was never worthy of it and was only granted this position out of the generous grace of God. But God has withdrawn His grace and does not remember His footstool. 
Never was the footstool anything He needed. Just like man does not need a footstool to place his feet on. It is something he enjoys and which he can rest with. But if it causes him tireless effort and work to repair and maintain the beauty of it, then it should be thrown away in the fire.  

*2 The Lord has swallowed up without mercy*
*all the habitations of Jacob;*
*in his wrath he has broken down*
*the strongholds of the daughter of Judah;*
*he has brought down to the ground in dishonor*
*the kingdom and its rulers.*

The depiction of God's anger gets even more intense. God Himself breaks down the strongholds of His own beloved city. He intends for this city to be attacked without any defense. This was His plan. He did not give them anything to protect themselves with. He does not give them any odds of surviving. When God does something, He is thorough. He will finish it, and when He destroys something, He will make sure not a single piece is left. Inasmuch as God *wanted* to destroy this, He has done so accordingly. Every Israelite who survived this period, survived not by luck, but by the will of God. 
Can anyone be angry with God when his family has been killed, or even just one member of his family? There are so many depictions of this in movies and in literature, all based one way or the other on true events. Even C.S. Lewis #tags/famouspeople/christian has troubles with this and I remember Adoniram Judson #tags/famouspeople/christian/missionaries as well when their wives died. But should man not rather be glad that he survived and that God was merciful on him? Instead of thankfulness we turn this back on God and curse Him for His mercy. Instead of devoting our lives to God for this mercy, we push God out of our lives because we are blind to His mercy and look only at our loss and not at what we have gained. 
We do not realize how great this mercy is that He has given us. It is a very small number of people who are chosen to stay alive and who are allowed to serve the Lord of hosts. 
The Israelite population was more than decimated when the Assyrians came and took away ten tribes, and when the Babylonians came and took the rest, after many had been killed in resistance. How many of those who remained have intermarried men and women of other religions and lost their inheritance and did not pass these on to their progeny? How many decided to stay in Persia after the emperor, or king Cyrus, allowed them to go back to Israel? 
It has been said that out of the remainder in Persia, only ten percent returned. Effectively this would be only one percent of the original population of Israel. #todo/opzoeken hoeveel exact

**Voorbeeld.** #todo/nogaftemaken  huis opengebroken. Man die huis heeft gebouwd, breekt expres de deur af en de poort die het huis horen te beschermen zodat het helemaal openstaat voor inbrekers en relschoppers. 
Het kan hem "niets meer" schelen wat deze mensen gaan doen met het huis, al het bezit in het huis of zelfs met de mensen in deze huis. 
Nee, eigenlijk kan het hem juist heel veel schelen en het is juist omdat deze mensen hem zoveel schelen dat hij zo boos is geworden. Maar mensen worden boos en emotioneel en doen dan dingen waar ze later spijt van hebben. Ze zeggen ook dingen waar ze spijt van hebben zoals: "Ik hoop dat je dood gaat." 
Maar God is niet Iemand die dingen doet waar Hij spijt van krijgt. Als Hij al spijt zou krijgen van iets, dan zou Hij van tevoren al weten dat Hij er spijt van zou krijgen en dan zou Hij dus bewust gekozen hebben om toch die beslissing te nemen. 

Jonah die boos wordt op God nadat hij uitgespuugd is op het land, omdat het schip waarmee hij reisde verwoest is, de lading is weg. Hij voelt zich schuldig naar de kapitein of ship's owner toe omdat het zijn schuld is dat alles nu weg is. Zijn nieuwe kleren zijn helemaal kapot en hij weet niet waar hij is, maar zal heel veel tijd kwijt zijn en geld om zijn reis te betalen naar waar hij heen wilde gaan. 
In plaats van dankbaar te zijn naar God omdat zijn leven gered is en toe te geven dat God almachtig is, en zich over te geven aan Zijn wil en zijn leven in dienst te stellen van Hem, loopt hij zelfs weg van God.

*3 He has cut down in fierce anger*
*all the might of Israel;*
*he has withdrawn from them his right hand*
*in the face of the enemy;*
*he has burned like a flaming fire in Jacob,*
*consuming all around.*
::*4 He has bent his bow like an enemy,*::
::*with his right hand set like a foe;*::
*and he has killed all who were delightful ::in our eyes::*
*in the tent of the daughter of Zion;*
*he has poured out his fury like fire.*

We should note that God killed those who were delightful in *our* eyes. Quite often it is the case that when we think of something as delightful, that it is not as delightful as we think it is—especially not to God! We love the things God detests. God detests our lust for fame, money and sex, and we thrive in it. These are the biggest moneymakers in the world. 
But also when it concerns people, the ones we love the most are the most detestable persons. Obama is seen by many as a great president—except by those who see the truth—and no one criticizes Bill Clinton, whether for his role as president or for the many women he slept with. John F. Kennedy is always praised for his accomplishments and speeches, but never are his affairs seen as something immoral and unworthy of a president. #tags/politics I do not even need to mention the many sports and movie stars and singers with their immoral behavior on and off the screen which are delightful to the many, but detestable in God's eyes. 
When God killed all of those in verse 4, whether He was in a rage or not, He is righteous to do so, for these people were unrighteous and God is never unjust. 

*5 The Lord has become like an enemy;*
*he has swallowed up Israel;*
*he has swallowed up all its palaces;*
*he has laid in ruins its strongholds,*
*and he has multiplied in the daughter of Judah*
*mourning and lamentation.*

This is true, but a strong understatement in my opinion. God is more furious than all the enemies of the world combined together and His wrath and fire burn hotter than the hottest temperatures in the universe—even hotter than the core of the biggest star. The mourning He causes is greater than any enemy could ever do to people. No device of torture could ever even approach the likes of the pain God can inflict on the body, the mind and the soul. As a matter of fact, not even the Satan can torment the soul, not even a bit—let alone how puny man is. But God can *destroy* the soul. 
It is unimaginable how great the mourning was in Jerusalem, knowing that God can affect every aspect of a person's life. A woman who would have lost her father, husband and child—the older ones as soldiers, and the younger ones as infants—at the same time would already have an unimaginable loss to most of us—although this is still a reality in many parts of the world and in history whenever there was war—four kinds of love and the same number of kinds of grief. But God does not stop there. He adds to it the loss of one's home, the city, the despair of not having food and on top of that mockery by one's enemies. 
In normal cases a person would not even go through this kind of misery because his feelings would have been blocked or he would have killed himself to prevent himself from feeling any more pain. But God allows this pain, because it is necessary. He can multiply the worst pain any man in history has ever felt, except for that of His Son, Jesus Christ. 
But know that God is *like* an enemy. We are fortunate that He is *not* our enemy or Jerusalem—and we as well—would have been worse off. We cannot imagine how there could be anything worse than this, but we should fear Him and Him alone. He is the only one Who can make the Satan and his demons tremble merely by letting them hear Name of His Son.
Our God is so great and revered. All of his character traits and every part of His personality is to be praised in the highest. No criticism is allowed for our God—all criticism from the world is because of a lack of understanding of the greatness of the Lord Yahweh and no one understands the Father fully but His Son, Jesus Christ, and no one understands the Father at all except through His Holy Spirit. 

*6 He has laid waste his booth like a garden,*
*laid in ruins his meeting place;*
*the LORD has made Zion forget*
*festival and Sabbath,*
*and in his fierce indignation has spurned king and priest.*
*7 The Lord has scorned his altar,*
*disowned his sanctuary;*
*he has delivered into the hand of the enemy*
*the walls of her palaces;*
*they raised a clamor in the house of the LORD*
*as on the day of festival.*

What examples of extreme opposites are given here. God's altar, which is so holy that whoever puts anything unholy on it will die, as sort of happened with two sons of Aaron. Yet now the Lord Himself has scorned it and disowned His sanctuary which is supposed to be—as the name says—a sanctified place. It was supposed to be holy and set aside for the Lord, but the people used it for other gods or they might have sacrificed on it with an undevoted #todo/opzoeken/engels heart that was not devoted to God. 
Now, the enemy comes and invades the house of the Lord, the temple that is, and God does not take action #todo/opzoeken/engels ingrijpen because the house already has been desanctified #todo/opzoeken/engels defiled. Nothing holy is trespassed or made unholy. All of this has been done already. 
Whereas silence should always be present in the temple for the reverence of God and clamor on the most holy days, now there is silence on the streets due to mourning and clamor in the temple in the most unholy way. The enemy is trespassing a multitude of laws, but God does not take action, for He has left this place and the punishment He is inflicting on the people has not been enough yet. The enemies are 
* gentiles who enter the temple, even up to the Holiest and the Holiest of Holiest #todo/opzoeken/engels heilige der heiligen—to which even the righteous Israelites are not allowed
* they are irreverently make noise in the temple 
* they are touching everything that cannot be touched
* did not not wash themselves or cleansed themselves before entering 
* took away and 
* destroyed the holy artefacts of the temple.
God killed #todo/opzoeken ... for merely *touching* the Ark—and he did it with the right intention! But now God does not take any action at all, which shows how far He is from the Israelite people and how much He has *allowed* his temple to be laid waste like a garden (see verse 6) but even more than that, He has *delivered* the walls into the hands of the enemy, as a gift, just like the walls of Jericho were delivered to Joshua.  

*8 The LORD determined to lay in ruins*
*the wall of the daughter of Zion;*
*he stretched out the measuring line;*
*he did not restrain his hand from destroying;*
*he caused rampart and wall to lament;*
*they languished together.*

The Lord *determined* to lay Zion in ruins. We know from Isaiah 14:24,27 that no one can stop God when He has even *planned* it, and even less people (although there cannot be any people less than "no one", but hypothetically speaking) could stop God when He has *purposed* it. Here, God is *determined* to destroy Jerusalem, which is almost as strong as having a purpose. 
Of course God's purpose for building Jerusalem was not to destroy it, rather yet, it is to make it His holy city—and for this very reason He has to destroy what is not holy about it, which is *everything* at the moment—including all the things and people within in! 
But see the hope that lies here, which is the measuring line. What God has measured and planned for destruction, that has been determined, but what has not been measured, that is still redeemable. God is infinitely righteous and will destroy and punish according to the greatness of the sin. Now the sin the people committed, is infinitely great because it is committed towards an infinitely holy God, but God relativizes this according to their knowledge of the Law and moral values and He has punished accordingly. 

*9 Her gates have sunk into the ground;*
*he has ruined and broken her bars;*
*her king and princes are among the nations;*
*the law is no more,*
*and her prophets find*
*no vision from the LORD.*
*10 The elders of the daughter of Zion*
*sit on the ground in silence;*
*they have thrown dust on their heads*
*and put on sackcloth;*
*the young women of Jerusalem*
*have bowed their heads to the ground.*

The definition of a country is not whether it has a king or even a ruler. Israel was a sovereign nation before she had her first king, Saul, or any judge mentioned in Judges, because she had her true ruler, which is God. But without a ruler, there is no enforcement of the law, without the law morality is hard to find and without the prophets there is no replacement for this law. 
Notice that this is like the three branches of government (by [Montesquieu](https://www.biography.com/scholar/charles-louis-de-secondat)) that is implemented in most western countries, but that these are not three separate organs acting out the responsibilities, for God is perfect and just and able to fulfil all three by Himself. In the period of the united kingdom of Israel, the executive and the judicial branch was led by the king, where he also served as a judge (see for example Solomon's ruling in 1 Kings 3:16-27 and Jehoram's ruling in 2 Kings 6:28ee). The judicial branch, however, was led by a prophet, like Nathan was before David—not that any new laws were made, but perhaps interpretations of those. In the classical age (around 0 AD) we see that the scribes (usually the Pharisees) had taken over this role and that prophets were rare—only a few still appear in the book of Acts (e.g. the daughters of Philip and one in Jerusalem upon Paul's last return there #todo/opzoeken ). The scribes might have had the same secular authority over the people, but spiritually seen they were most certainly not on the same level as the prophets. The rabbis would later on take over the role of the scribes and create books such as the Talmud, with in it "the  [Mishnah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishnah)  (משנה‎, c. 200), a written  [compendium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compendium)  of Rabbinic Judaism's  [Oral Torah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_Torah) ; and the  [Gemara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemara)  (גמרא‎, c. 500), an  [elucidation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/elucidation)  of the Mishnah and related  [Tannaitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannaim)  writings that often ventures onto other subjects and expounds broadly on the  [Hebrew Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh)" (quoted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud)). The oral traditions would most likely have been practised in Jesus' time, but were written down c. 200 AD. These traditions contained rules that deviated from God's intention for the people, as can be seen in the fact that Jesus often mentioned and corrected the Pharisees on their interpretation and use of arguments from the Bible. 
Moses' ruling is similar to that of the kings' in that Moses was both judge and leaders of the executive branch. However, he himself was the prophet who heard from God and received and interpreted the Law, so in that sense, the leader of the judicial branch as well. He is the only person who has led all three branches of government at the same time, but note that God was strictly on him. God provided the Law, God provided the ultimate judging and execution of criminals, and God executed and implemented the laws or let Moses do it but corrected him whenever he did anything wrong. 
Also note that although this elements of government were implicitly incorporated in God's form of government, they were not executed as such as can been seen in the fact that both Moses, the Judges and the kings led multiple branches, which defeats the purpose of the *trias politica*. God did used the branched form of government in another way, namely in the branches of the king, priest and prophet and there only Jesus has ever been and will ever be the only One Who fulfills all three roles. 
A true theocratic country, which the United States is not, unfortunately, should have the role of someone who listens to God (the prophet) and someone who offers to God an atonement. A minister of God the Most Holy should be a prophet and advising the President on how to run the country, but instead, in 2020 a leftist comedian named Jimmy Kimmel has been called *[America's conscience](https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/03/media/jimmy-kimmel-las-vegas-conscience/index.html)* (see also https://www.libertynation.com/jimmy-kimmel-americas-conscience)—someone who not only is not educated for this role, but also has severely immoral values, shown in his shows. 

*11 My eyes are spent with weeping;*
*my stomach churns;*
*my bile is poured out to the ground*
*because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,*
*because infants and babies faint*
*in the streets of the city.*
*12 They cry to their mothers,*
*“Where is bread and wine?”*
*as they faint like a wounded man*
*in the streets of the city,*
*as their life is poured out*
*on their mothers' bosom.*

When the author, most likely Jeremiah, returns to the first person he describes all of his psychosomatic pains, i.e. his physical pains caused by mental factors. His stomach hurts so much that his bile, i.e. his gall, is poured out—although this probably meant figuratively. It could be that he vomited literally and that there was bitterness in it, but there would be no gall in it because the vomit would only consist of the contents of the stomach and the gall is further down the gastro-intestinal tract. Either way, most importantly, Jeremiah describes the reason *why* he has so much pain: it is because of the destruction of the daughter of Israël, which is—in my interpretation—the *women* of Israel, and because of the *children*. 
It would be normal to see many slaughtered men in a war, but to see little children literally fainting from hunger, children as thin as sticks with their bones visibly protruding from under their skin—that is a sight that no sane and moral man can stand. On top of that Jeremiah saw the crying of the mothers who could not do anything about it and could merely hold them in their bosom while they fainted and died from hunger. The most insensitive man—figuratively, for the Nazis had done worse to Jews and others in concentration camps, as well as communists such as Mao and Stalin #tags/famouspeople —would have sorrow for this reason and Jeremiah was no insensitive man. As a matter of fact, as a prophet he was speaking on behalf of God when writing this and his feelings are representative of God's feelings. It is God *Himself* who is weeping over *His own daughter and children*! 

*13 What can I say for you, to what compare you,*
*O daughter of Jerusalem?*
*What can I liken to you, ::that I may comfort you::,*
*O virgin daughter of Zion?*
*For your ruin is vast as the sea;*
*who can heal you?*
*14 Your prophets have seen for you*
*false and deceptive visions;*
*they have not exposed your iniquity*
*to restore your fortunes,*

The prophets of Juda could have rescued Jerusalem, but instead of exposing her to true prophecies of Israel's and Judah's sin, they gave her false visions of wealth. Jerusalem did not change her way because she did not see her sin. Partly this is the prophets' fault, but Israel itself is to blame as well, for she did not want to see her own sin or know anything about God. 
The example of the warning of a nation is given by multiple prophets. Perhaps most notable is the example of Jonah where a whole city changed its ways—one of the most depraved cities of all, Nineveh, which boasted many idols and was the capital city—perhaps the religious capital as well—of the Assyrian Empire. A whole city was saved because of the warning of one prophet. Ezekiel, however, did not manage to save the people—aside from the fact that he was in Babylon. 
Why did God, through Ezekiel, want to let the people know what was going to happen? The Jewish people could not have done anything anymore right? #biblestudy/questions Or could they have changed their ways and prayed for their brothers in Jerusalem? #todo/nogaftemaken

*but have seen for you oracles*
*that are false and misleading.*
*15 All who pass along the way*  
*clap their hands at you;*
*they hiss and wag their heads*
*at the daughter of Jerusalem:*
*“Is this the city that was called*
*the perfection of beauty,*
*the joy of all the earth?”*

The greatest shame of a person is a lack of honor at one's grave and contempt over it. For this city, which is depicted as a person, it is the same. The people see this graveyard of Jerusalem and instead of crying over it, they make sarcastic remarks. Even after this city's death, its enemies still gloat over it. 
Was this a prediction to motivate the Israelites to confess their sins and turn all of this around? No, it was too late for that. By the time of this writing the Israelites had already been taken away by the Assyrians and been spread across the peoples; The Judahites were still "present" but Jerusalem had already been destroyed. #todo/nogaftemaken 

*16 All your enemies*
*rail against you;*
*they hiss, they gnash their teeth,*
*they cry: “We have swallowed her!*
*Ah, this is the day we longed for;*
*now we have it; we see it!”*

This shows that the people who destroyed Jerusalem were aiming for Jerusalem, first of all. It was not about gaining more land, because otherwise they would have had the same feeling when they conquered other big cities in Israel. But second of all, they were intentionally raiding and destroying Israel. It was not about a conquering of the nations. Israel was a specific target! 
Assyria and Babylon, the mighty high empires were specifically targeting Israel! 
Why would they be so interested in destroying Israel? Why would other empires be so focused on them too? I do not know about Syria and Greece for example who were also colonialized by the Roman empire... #todo/nogaftemaken 
In the past one could say that Israel was specifically targeted for its stash of gold and later on for its strategic position on the Silk Route; Jerusalem could even be taken for its strategic position in warfare because it was so hard to conquer, but now that it had been conquered—perhaps with ease, due to God's help—this honor and reputation would be gone. All that was still good about Israel was its plenty of fertile land and its vicinity to water, i.e. the Jordan and many other rivers.

![](Lamentations%202%20(ESV)/Israels-rivers-after-Bar-Or-2000_Q320.jpg)

That, of course, would or could be a main reason for targeting Israel. When an empire wanted to expand its territory it would need sufficient people and hence water to populate and maintain it.
In the eyes of historians this might have been the case, but from a Biblical perspective we know that there is a spiritual warfare going on. Why else would the countries of the United Nations and the UN itself spend to much time on condemning Israel for its "acts of terror"—while these are almost all justifiable—while ignoring the real acts of terror, e.g. those committed by dictatorships in so many other countries? Why would they prefer Palestine, a country known for its bombs it has planted in populated areas, which sacrifices its own *civilians*—women and children!—by using them as shields during a rocket launch attack from Israel that was announced many weeks #todo/opzoeken  in advance? It is unknown to me—from a secular perspective—why any rational person would prefer an aggressive and terrorist Islamic country such as Palestine, which does not keep its word and break promises over and over again, over a Western Democratic one such as Israel which has kept its word and only wants to have peace. 
From a Biblical perspective the answer is clear: the Satan wants to kill God's children, that is the Israelites, and raid the country that God has promised and given them. He wants to break the promise that God has made, but that is an impossible thing to do, *for God cannot break His promise and He cannot be unfaithful* (cf. 2 Timothy 2:13). 

*17 The LORD has done what he purposed;*
*he has carried out his word,*
*which he commanded long ago;*
*he has thrown down without pity;*
*he has made the enemy rejoice over you*
*and exalted the might of your foes.*

Man could never say that his purpose is to do what he said, for he could say one thing this time and another thing at another time. But what God says, is always in line with His character. So when God says that is going to do something, that thing automatically becomes His purpose. 
He has said that Israel would be conquered by its foes. Would that mean that Israel did not have any chance of escaping this? Yes, eventually Israel would succumb to its enemy, but not because God said so, but because she was disobedient. We need to remember that God is just, He would not punish any Israelite if he were obedient to God. Even the prophets, i.e. the authors of the Bible, who could be considered as holy and obedient persons, such as Daniel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea and Ezekiel either lived in exile or in Israel or Judah during turmoil and a dictatorial and not God-fearing king, some of those were even killed and had to suffer. But God was still righteous to those prophets. First of all because no man deserves to live, considering his own record of righteousness, *for all have sinned* (see Romans 3:23) and deserve to die. 

*18 Their heart cried to the Lord.*
*O wall of the daughter of Zion,*
*let tears stream down like a torrent*
*day and night!*
*Give yourself no rest,*
*your eyes no respite!*

We should not merely lift up our hands to God as in verse 19, but we should also show true repentance which goes along with tears of mourning, *day and night*—mourning for what has been broken in God's heart. In the middle of the night, when we cannot sleep, we should cry out to Him. That should be our first instinct. 
When people wake up in the middle of the night they have a certain comfort, they know (or think) that they are in their bed in their room. That is why many, on their first day in another place, such as on a holiday, when they wake up in the middle of the night, they require some time to realize where they are. For Christian, however, no time should be required to know that we are in God's presence. The hallmark of a true Christian is that He knows that God sees his every action and that He is always near, even in his dreams. 
I have had dreams in which I committed sinful acts, but even then I knew I was sinning, and immediately after I woke up, I felt guilty and repented of my sin, because I knew that in my dream I had the chance not to sin, but still allowed myself to do it. It was sort of a simulation, perhaps without any impact on real life, but a test I failed and that I would fail in real life as well, to show me I am not ready for the big temptations of this world. Both in my dreams and immediately after I woke up I felt the presence of God. 
These days, and a few weeks ago as well, I wake up in the middle of the night and though I am not good at praying—I do not have beautiful or powerful prayers or long prayers—I do feel the urge to call out to God and ask Him why it is that I cannot sleep. What or whom does He want me to pray for or to ask Him? When this happened a few weeks ago it happened on three days, and on those three different nights I realized I had to forgive one or more persons or ask them for forgiveness. In three of those cases it was about an ex-girlfriend whom I had not treated well during the relationship, but it was impossible for me to make amends because I did not have their contact details anymore or they did not want have contact with me anymore. But I had to realize the pain I had inflicted (again, because I thought I had already done so years ago) and repent of my actions.
This week, this happened again, after a discussion with my wife. During this discussion she had not hurt my feelings, but I had hurt hers, although I do not know why and how and with what words exactly. So when I woke up in the middle of the night, after only a few hours of sleep, the first thing that came to mind was, *what have I done that made her so sad?* As she did not want to talk about it, I thought there was nothing I could do anymore, so the next evening the same thing happened again, losing a lot of sleep over it. But the day after, when I was working on my *Celebrate Recovery®* *moral inventory*, which is a list of everyone with whom I should make amends, either forgiving them or asking for forgiveness and the reason for it stated there explicitly (#todo Footnote: For more about the Bible-based Celebrate Recovery® program go to celebraterecovery.com.), I discovered that I had added my wife in the list of people to forgive *twice*! I added her this year, not knowing that I had added her last year as well, both times for the same reasons. It appeared I had not even explicitly forgiven her last year. 
What I needed to forgive her, and which was probably the cause of our discussions and fights, was that she often spoils the sphere with her mood swings, of course due to her womanhood, but also due to low sugar due to not having eaten enough, lack of sleep in the morning, tiredness in the evening, stress due to being late, stress from outside, e.g. from colleagues, COVID-19 regulations or anything negative that happened on the way, and so many other things. If I cannot forgive her for everything she has done over the past years, then every time this happens again, it only piles up on the existing stack. If I cannot accept that this is who she is, and love her as she is with all of my heart, then this stack will continue to grow every time no matter how often I forgive her.     

*19 “Arise, cry out in the night,*
*at the beginning of the night watches!*
*Pour out your heart like water*
*before the presence of the Lord!*
*Lift your hands to him*
*for the lives of your children,*
*who faint for hunger*
*at the head of every street.”*

The people in Israel do not realize that the fate of their children lies in their own hands. It is up to them to raise their hands to God, to confess their sins and repent from their wickedness, but even at the cost of their children, just like pharaoh, they refuse to do that. Perhaps afterwards, when this all had happened. A warning was not sufficient for them to repent, they had to experience the punishment even though God wanted to prevent this at great cost. He inflicted the Israelites with lesser punishments but they did not repent. Now the only thing that remained was to inflict the harshest punishment of all. He had to destroy His own beloved city, Jerusalem, and and destroy a great part of His daughter, that is His people, and His Son, that is Jesus Christ. Everything He gave up to save us. 

*20 Look, O LORD, and see!*
*With whom have you dealt thus?*
*Should women eat the fruit of their womb,*
*the children of their tender care?*
*Should priest and prophet be killed*
*in the sanctuary of the Lord?*

Jeremiah is asking the Lord a rhetorical question to which the answer seemingly is a firm "no". Jeremiah pleads for God's compassion, but at the same time he already knows that this is not what God wants but that He has to do this because He said He would—and God's Word stands like an oath, even when He does not swear by Himself. 
Is it right then to try to get compassion from God when we already know He is far more compassionate than we are? Is it of any use to ask God to stop when He is working out His plan, are we not going against God then? 
I think God not only allowed Jeremiah to speak out his laments but also allowed it in the Biblical canon for a reason. God shows us that He does listen to Jeremiah and that He cares about His daughter, more than we will ever be able to understand, but some things need to happen and the people of Israel—and in this case, the whole world, because the readers of this book are located in the whole world—need to so the punishment that will happen on *them* as well when we disobey God and do not repent. 
The punishment is so severe that even the most innocent ones, the children, will be killed in the most gruesome way, by the people from whom one would expect it least: their own mothers. And the consecrated people get killed in the holiest place of all: in the sanctuary of God. 
Back to the question that Jeremiah asked of God: should all of this happen? The answer is *yes*, for it is part of God's plan. 

*21 In the dust of the streets*
*lie the young and the old;*
*my young women and my young men*
*have fallen by the sword;*
*you have killed them in the day of your anger,*
*slaughtering without pity.*
*22 You summoned as if to a festival day*
*my terrors on every side,*
*and on the day of the anger of the LORD*
*no one escaped or survived;*
*those whom I held and raised*
*my enemy destroyed.*

Jeremiah is not accusing God here, as He already knows it is God Who did this or allowed this, but he is rather pointing out the #todo/opzoeken/engels size of what has been done here.
