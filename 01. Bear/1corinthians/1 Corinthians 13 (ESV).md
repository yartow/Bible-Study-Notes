# 1 Corinthians 13 (ESV) 
***The Way of Love***
*1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 2 And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3 If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.*

Continuing in the same context as that of the previous chapter we see that Paul is saying this because a group with the Corinthian church obviously had no love for their fellow church members and thought of their gifts than those of others and held their "higher status"—which they thought they had as a consequence of their "more special" gifts—in higher esteem than love. Paul states the opposite of this, using hyperbolic examples such as being able to speak all languages, understanding every mystery of the whole universe and being able to remove mountains and deeming them worthless if he does not have love. 
It is interesting to see that the big tech of this age are exactly doing what Paul is stating. Google speaks all languages through its AI in Google Translate; Amazon Echo (Alexa), Apple Siri and Google home try to know everything there is, also through their AI which analyze all knowledge available on the Internet; Tesla (or Elon Musk's #tags/famouspeople other companies) is the next party, commonly not noted under big tech, because they are a car company, but definitely part of it, which is in the process of creating a whole network of underground transportation and wants not to move mountains, but move part of humanity to Mars, which is in these days an even more difficult feat to pull off. Interestingly, no company aims to be the greatest giver of all, to break the world record of philanthropy.
The question is: Do these companies love the people? Are they doing what they do out of love or for other motives? Even if it is not out of love, do they at least have good motives? In the case of Elon Musk he thinks it is good for humanity to escape Earth, for some reason, but Facebook and Google simply want to have all data on everyone in order to get more sales of their products. There is no love at all in the latter, although I do not trust the former either. 

*4 Love is patient and kind;*

Love is patient, but we are not—at least, most of us are not. I can wait for something when I am in line. People do that all the time, when they wait for the sale of tickets of concert by their idol, or for the newest Apple product or even for their favorite piece of barbecue meat at Franklin's Barbecue in Housten, Texas. In all three cases people wait in line for hours, sometimes starting at midnight or even earlier before the shop opens the next day. They have patience because they have something to hope for. 
In the case of relationships this patience is nowhere to be found, because people see no goal. Young men might be patient with their girlfriends, because they still have a purpose of marrying them or another selfish purpose such as getting them in bed. Married men, however, generally do not see sex as a reward for being patient. For example, when a man is irritated by something his wife is doing in the morning, he will not have in mind that he needs to be patient so that he will get sex tonight. 
The general problem is that people, that is both men and do not see any purpose to being patient. They see no reward. 
The reward of course is obedience to God, it is treasure in heaven and the forming of character in our lives. With it, we will have better relationship that will benefit us as well. It will take a long time before we see the fruit of this good behavior, but that too requires patience.

What does it mean that love is kind? Any child can instinctively tell whether a person is kind. It is a trait that crosses cultural boundaries and is done in the same way in *every* culture. For sure there are cultures such as Japan where a father does not smile or say anything, yet still indicating he is proud of someone, but that is not the same as being kind. Also, in Japan it is not kind to give someone a compliment, because the receiver of this compliment would think that you elevate yourself above him—but in my opinion kindness still overrules. When something is said or done with kindness even a person from a high context culture such as the Japanese or Korean one, will perceive kindness and forgive those who do not understand their culture. #tags/culture 
As such, kindness does not need any explanation. 

*love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant* 

Love always seeks the best for a person. Self-love seeks the best for oneself, but unconditional love for another person—which is what the Greek word for love (ἀγάπη) means here—seeks the best for that other person. 
Envy is the exact opposite and has much to do with the definition in v.5. However, where v.5 mentions that love does not seek its own way—meaning a person who wants the best for himself—envious feelings would be independent of one's own ways or one's possessions but merely depend on what the other person has. It is like being "jealous" of someone who has something better than what you have, only in the case that that thing the other person has belongs to you, it is called jealousy, but in the case it does not belong to you, it is called envy. 
Not only that, however, it could also be deemed envy when you do not care about getting this thing that the other person has, but you merely want others to have less than you. 
In my life this was a problem when my wife got elected to be in the core-team of our church, a temporary team that functioned as the board of elders and deacons. Later on, when they decided to actually have elders, she was nominated again. Aside from the fact that I do not think a woman should do this—which she was not completely convinced of at the time—she decided not to accept the role because it would cause strife in our marriage. She knew how I longed for that position or at least to be in control. She also knew that I would go against anyone in my way, which is what v.5 is saying—obviously, I did not love the leaders of the church—but I would go even harder against my own wife when she had made a decision which I did not agree with. 
Envy was underlying all of these feelings because I felt powerless and someone I deemed less than I (the "arrogance" mentioned in v.4) had more power than I. 

In short, for all of the characteristics mentioned of love I can name examples showing that I am incapable of loving others the right way—and I am only half-way through the list! 

*5 or rude. It does not insist on its own way;*

Perhaps a good way of rephrasing this would be to say that love is flexible, it is capable of making compromises. We usually do not get our own way and sometimes another person's way is just not the right way (in our opinion), so we try to look for middle ground. 

*it is not irritable or resentful;*

Another translation says: 
> Love is not easily angered.   
Or in other words, the person who loves is not easily angered. Because he loves another person, he is patient with him. Because he loves this other person more than himself, when he is hurt by the other, it will not easily anger him. Anger in this case comes from the fact that one cares about oneself too much. We will become angry about the things that we care about. But if this person cares more about the other, he will care less about himself and not be easily angered.
My wife once said that I used the wrong detergent to mop the floors because it reeked and I thought she was wrong and that is was not because of the detergent but rather due to mold in the mop itself. But more than that, I was angry because she did not believe me. This is a typical example of pride. I cared more about myself and that I had to be right; I cared so much about myself that it did not matter to me to start a discussion or a fight with her. 

It does not insist on its own way; -> self-seeking
 it is not irritable -> not easily angered
or resentful; -> keeps no record of wrongs #todo/nogaftemaken 

Another aspect of love is that it is not resentful, meaning that it keeps no record of wrongs. When couples divorce there usually is so much resent even after many years, which may even increase because of the divorce and its proceedings. Quite obviously, it is the lack of love that caused them to divorce, but more specifically there was no forgiveness. Without forgiveness it is impossible to live together with someone because the sins the other commit will only build up. If there is partial forgiveness, for example forgiveness of everything except for that one sin such as an extra-marital affair, that too will lead to resent. The sin will not increase at the one who cheated, for his sin stays the same over the years, but the sin of him who is unwilling to forgive and who perhaps has a desire for this other person to be punished will conceive, and give birth to sin (James 1:15). And so it will be the sin of the unforgiving person that leads to the divorce and the demise of his own happiness. 

*6 it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.*

Sexual offenders know they are doing wrong things and they delight in them. Obviously they do not have love towards their victims nor to anyone for that matter. 
Real love would rejoice with the truth. What is the truth then? For those people of the LGBT-community the "truth" is that they were born this way and that other people should accept them. However, deep inside they know something is wrong with the system we live in. We cannot force people to accept them, we cannot force companies to hire LGBT people just because of their sexual preferences. There is a merit system in life and affirmative action (positive discrimination) is not part of this. 

*7 Love bears all things,*

Life can be unbearable, especially when everything and everyone seem to be against you. Life itself even seems to be against you. But when you have a goal in mind, something you look forward to, life suddenly becomes bearable. This dot on the horizon might even increase the bearability of life when it is not a thing, such as a material objective, but a personal one, or better yet, a person. 
One can love his job, or he can love wealth or a specific object such as a yaght, but this love will never be as strong as that between two persons. As long as the love is strong enough, the persons are able to bear anything. 
Jesus was able to go through suffering like no one in the world ever has done, because He so loved the Father and us. 

*believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.*

Love believes all things. This does not mean that love is foolish to believe everything a person says—although many people are foolish and believe their loved ones' lies, when they are in love. Perhaps this points to a certain faith. A couple might believe they can manage through the storm in their marriage, whether that is adultery or a deceased child. This then, is related to hope and enduring #todo/nogaftemaken #todo/opzoeken/engels endurement? for hope has no basis unless there is belief or certainty, and enduring will not last long if there is no hope. 

*8 Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.*

The way I understand this is that prophecies, tongues and knowledge will all come to nothing in heaven, for we will have complete knowledge then (v.12) and know God and His plan fully, which renders prophecies unnecessary. Everyone will speak in one language—that of God, or at least is able to understand or speak each other's languages. 
Love, however, is something that will always remain, for it is part of God and it is needed everywhere, both in heaven as on Earth. 

*9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. 11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I ::gave up:: childish ways. 12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.*
*13 So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.*

Using the same reasoning out of the three—faith, hope and love—only love would abide in my view, for faith and hope will not be necessary anymore as soon as we are in heaven. One does not need faith to know that God is real. Even those who have not been saved will know, without faith, that Jesus is King of the Heaven and Earth #todo/opzoeken  referentie. Our hope for any future events will have become knowledge because they will be certain. Already here on Earth we are certain of future events, but we have not seen them because they have not occurred yet. But in heaven there is no time and everything happens outside of time.
However, it clearly says that all three abide. How should we interpret this then? Faith is more than knowing that God exists, it is also the full submission of oneself to God. This of course continues in heaven and on the New Earth. Hope is certainty is what we do not see, like faith. Perhaps there is some kind of aspect of time there. If we look at the witnesses who cheer us on in Hebrews 12:1 we know that the people in heaven know one thing, and that is that we are not in heaven yet. So perhaps their hope will be that we, or else their loved ones, will end up in heaven.
