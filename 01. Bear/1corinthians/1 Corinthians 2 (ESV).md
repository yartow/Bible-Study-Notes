# 1 Corinthians 2 (ESV) 
***Proclaiming Christ Crucified***
*1 And I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom. 2 For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. 3 And I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling, 4 and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 5 so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.*

The "and" in verse 4 could probably be interpreted as "though", which would render the following translation. 
> *3 And I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling, 4 and even though my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, the power of the Spirit was still demonstrated. 5 This was so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.* #composed/bible/1corinthians  
Obviously Paul could not have said this if the result of his visit had no fruits. Apparently the people were very impressed by Paul's teaching. Paul does tell them that their impression was not because of him, but of the Holy Spirit, because he for sure did not use any difficult words nor did he show any wisdom, but rather an afraid and weak appearance. 

***Wisdom from the Spirit***
*6 Yet among the ::mature:: we do impart wisdom, although it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to pass away. 7 But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glory. 8 None of the rulers of this age understood this, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 9 But, as it is written,*
*“What no eye has seen, nor ear heard,*
*nor the heart of man imagined,*
*what God has prepared for those who love him”—*
*10 these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. 11 For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 12 Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. 13 And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.*

In verse 6 Paul is speaking of the *mature*, which are not mature Christians, but just Christians. The word *mature* in Greek means completed or perfects, which means those who have been made perfect in Christ, which are Christians. 
In verse 13 he ends this part about Christians, also naming them "those who are spiritual", as opposed to verse 14 where he starts a paragrah about "the natural person."
 
*14 The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. 15 The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one.*

Verse 15 is related to its previous verse. The spiritual person can judge things that are natural, for he knows the laws of this world and of that of God. The natural person, however, can not judge the spiritual person, because his judgment can only be done by Christ, Who has already forgiven the spiritual person.

*16 “For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ.*

Paul is not mocking Isaiah when he wrote this in Isaiah 40:13, but rather affirming this. Isaiah meant it rhetorically and the answer was clear, no only—except for God Himself or rather His spirit. This implies, however, that whoever has the Spirit of God can also know His mind, hence the "but" here in verse 16. 
> *16 “For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” No one, except for God Himself (that is, His own Spirit or His mind), but we have the mind of Christ.* (YT) #composed/bible/1corinthians
