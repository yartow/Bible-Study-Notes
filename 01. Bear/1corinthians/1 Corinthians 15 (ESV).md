# 1 Corinthians 15 (ESV) 
***The Resurrection of Christ***
*1 Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, 2 and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.*

*You are being saved* if, and most likely only if, you hold fast to the Word of God. This is a present continuous, a form of verbs that cannot be translated into Dutch.
#todo/opzoeken is this *unless* a *lest*?
It means that the process of saving has not been completed yet. Now the question is, has salvation been completed yet then?
Salvaging is another process than redeeming which is again something else than saving. All of these are translated with the same word "redden" in Dutch, but should be distinguished, especially in this context. Perhaps sometimes it is translated as "one is being kept from" (U wordt bewaard van) #todo/opzoeken 1 Cor 13:10

#todo/nogaftemaken
#todo/opzoeken Griekse vertaling
When one is saving food, he is not doing anything with the food itself. He is merely keeping it and protecting it from others who want to steal it, or from bacteria who want to eat it, in a sense, and spoil it. But food is saved by preparing it with salt or by fermenting it, wicking #todo/opzoeken/engels or sealing it airtight. This, in a sense, is what God is doing with us.
Because we are still prone to our own flesh and to the attacks of the Satan, He keeps us from that by *saving* us, that is by preparing us. All of this life is preparation for the next.

*3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 5 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. 6 Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. 7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. 8 Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.*

This "untimely" does not mean that Paul was prematurely born and deficient in many things. Some preachers explained it this by saying that Paul like that because of his many spiritual flaws and hence humbles himself to that level. 
However, I think it rather means that Paul was like a baby born too late and hence Paul received the Gospel too late. Thus this saying is mentioning the timing, not the deficiencies or anything else about the baby. 

*9 For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.*

The "for" here also refers to the timing. Because he is the least of the apostles, Jesus appeared last to Him. This does not necessarily mean though that the first apostle whom Jesus appeared to, Andrew and his brother #todo/opzoeken were the greatest. 

*10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked ::harder:: than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me.*

By the grace of God Paul has become a great missionary, very talented in many fields, wise and intelligent. Paul is saying here that even though he is the least of the apostles, he is still very much gifted with these talents and gifts, perhaps even more than the other disciples. 
What Paul means by "not in vain" is that Paul has showed results in planting and teaching churches. Why did he not say the following then? #composed/bible/1corinthians 
> On the contrary, there are many results, resulting from this grace that I have received. Even more than that of the other disciples.  
He is not claiming to have more or better results, because the number of churches and even the number of converts are not fair measures #todo/opzoeken/engels maatstaven by which to measure one's fruit #todo/opzoeken/engels prestaties, iets anders dan results. God measures in his own way and all results are not man's but God's. For example every church planted is done through the Holy Spirit. One can build an amazing church building, but the resources (that is money and time) and permission (of the state or municipality) to build this come from the Lord. And when this building is finished, who brings the people or even visitors and tourists to the church? It is the Holy Spirit of course. 
Instead, Paul only claims he has worked harder. Regardless of the results, he has done his best, more than others. That is all he claims. That is still something one cannot claim with certainty. Even though Peter and the others stayed in Jerusalem and traveled less than he did, all of them were most likely martyred as well. Even though they did not travel over land and sea, the work they did in the city was not little. But Paul writes through the Spirit and he also mentions that this hard work was not even from himself, but from the Spirit Who empowered him. 

*11 Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.*

"So" indicates the message in the first verses above, that is the Gospel. #todo/nogaftemaken 

***The Resurrection of the Dead***
*12 Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 14 And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. 15 We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. 16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. 17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. 18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. 19 If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.*

Paul argues that either there is a resurrection of the dead for all people, including Christ, or no resurrection at all. However, some would argue that there are two other options. Christ could have been the only person ever to have been resurrected. So God made an exception for His Son. Or Christ was not resurrected, but raised Himself, for He died in the flesh, but in the realm of the dead, whether in hell or in heaven, he could decide anytime to go back to Earth, as He had done before in His incarnation and in His earlier christophanies. 
Why did Paul not consider these two options? Concerning the first argument, Paul perhaps generalized his statement of "the resurrection of the dead", meaning that if there has ever been only one person resurrected from the dead, it is possible, and hence there is a resurrection of the dead (of course, resurrection as in obtaining a new physical body such as Jesus has, not the same perishable body as that of Lazarus and the widow's son in the story of Elijah #todo/opzoeken ). So even if Jesus is the only one ever to have been resurrected, it is correct to say that there is a resurrection of the dead. This renders the opposition's statement in v.13 wrong. 
However, this part is not about whether his statement is correct, for Paul's *implication* is that there is a resurrection for *all Christians*. So the question is, does Christ's resurrection imply that there is a resurrection for all Christians as well? The answer is: not in and of itself. Christ for example performed many miracles, but that in itself does not prove that we will be able to do these things as well. But it is His words which said that we would be able to perform miracles in His Name and that we would be resurrected with Him and be with Him in heaven or on the New Earth, where we get our certainty concerning this doctrine. 

*20 But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 21 For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. 22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. 23 But each in his own ::order::: Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. 24 Then comes the ::end::, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and ::every authority:: and power. 25 For he must reign ::until:: he has put all his enemies under his feet.*

Does this mean that Jesus does not reign anymore after all the enemies of the Earth, including death, have been destroyed or sent to hell? The answer is *yes*, possibly. It could be that there is no reign on the new Earth when we all live together. Jesus will be our King there, but also our friend. Though we will never be equal to Him, a reign will not be necessary. But I could be wrong #todo/nogaftemaken  

*26 The last enemy to be destroyed is death1pBut when it says, “all things are put in subjection,” it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him.*

The "for" in v.27 is put here to denote that *everything* is under Jesus' feet, even abstract things or concepts such as death. This means that even the concept of death is not known anymore on the New Earth. 
We do not know what we will know on the New Earth. Some say we will recognize Moses and other Biblical figures, but that is not written explicitly in the Bible. Peter #todo/opzoeken recognized Moses on the mountain #todo/opzoeken which one? during the transfiguration of Jesus, but perhaps that was by divine revelation, for there is mention of Moses' looks in the Old Testament, or simply because Jesus mentioned Moses' name. Even if we do recognize Moses, how can we know who he is, without remembering all the events described about him in the pentateuch? Do we only remember the good things about people then? #biblestudy/questions  #tags/theology/endtimes/newworld There will be no more sadness #todo/opzoeken  that is what we know. Limited as my thoughts are, the only 
conclusion I can come to is that there will be no memories linked to events that caused sadness. 
In a world without those memories and where everyone is sinless and therefore not able to hurt anyone, sadness is gone forever. 

*28 When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be ::subjected:: to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all.*

The Son, though part of the Trinitarian God-head, is still subjected to the Father. There is still a hierarchy within the Trinity. #todo/nogaftemaken 

*29 Otherwise, what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf?*

Derek Gilbert from SkywatchTV explained that this verse is a reference to the veneration of the dead that was going on in Corinth by the Greeks and unfortunately also was done (perhaps) by the Corinthians Paul addressed here. Perhaps this is also written in his book *Veneration*. 

*30 Why are we in danger every hour? 31 I protest, brothers, by my pride in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day! 32 What do I gain if, humanly speaking, I fought with beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” 33 Do not be deceived: “Bad company ruins good morals.”*

These ideas to give up everything before the end are obtained from bad company. Unfortunately Hollywood still promotes these ideas, or pictures these based on real life, but which is still promoting, in coming of age movies among others such as *St. Elmo's Fire* and *The Breakfast Club* or movies in which a woman—usually—gives away her virginity thinking that they will never meet again anyway, such as *The Notebook* #tags/movies. The movies do not show, however, what took place after these events. The latter shows the end of the protagonists' life in which the husband still loves his wife after decades of marriage, but it does not show how the woman or man might have had issues trusting each other, because the woman was betrothed to another man in the time that they had not seen each other.
Here, Paul uses a saying depicting the same kind of behavior, though not promoting it, but on the contrary, teaching the Corinthians that they must know the truth, which is to live a pure life up until the very end of the life (v.34), even when one knows he is going to die tomorrow.

*34 Wake up from your drunken stupor, as is right, and do not go on sinning. For some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.*

We should be ashamed for listening to or following some people for "some have no no knowledge of God". Why then do we, or Christians in general listen to those people? There are many wise people #tags/famouspeople such as Ben Shapiro, who is Orthodox Jewish, Justin Peterson #todo/opzoeken who believes more than an atheist but less than a Christian, and Dave Ruben who is gay, but none of them are Christian. That is why one of the preachers in our congregation hyperbolically said once during a sermon of his that the youngest [Christian, red.] in the congregation is wiser than the wisest unbelieving judge. For every Christian should at least say that one should stop sinning and the Christian should have a good definition of good morals—the first sin being not believing in Christ and accepting His free gift of grace. 

***The Resurrection Body***
*35 But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?” 36 You foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.*

Paul is not reprimanding them for not knowing the answer. He is  #todo/opzoeken/engels  verbaasd, perplex, about the fact that they had forgotten what he taught them about Jesus' sayings. The whole Gospel is based on the new life that we have in Christ, both here on Earth and in the afterlife. Of course we will not have vulnerable bodies on the New Earth as those we have right now. The question that the Corinthians asked was not about what kind of body we would have, but it was stated as a rhetorical argument, indicating that there is no resurrection of the body, because there is nothing left after the decomposition of the body. 
Paul then argues that this is logical, because new life can only come into existence after the old life has gone.

*37 And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain. 38 But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.*

We do not know which body we will get. All we know is that our body will be of the human kind, for that is what we are now. But it is God Who chooses the body *type*. Perhaps what Paul means here is the difference between bodies of the same kind, just like there are difference between dogs, even when they are of the same breed, so there will be differences between Christians when we receive our new bodies. 

*39 For not all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish. 40 There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is of one kind, and the glory of the earthly is of another. 41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.*

#todo/opzoeken going backwards in the order of creation, here starting with the sixth day of creation
The glory mentioned here is another than that of God, in two ways. First of all, of course the glory of God is unimaginably greater than everything else in this world (or in any other dimension or parallel world if there were any). Second of all, it is really difficult to define *glory*. The English dictionary [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/glory) has no less than five definitions of *glory* and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glory_(religion)) even has its own page on a specific definition of glory used as *religious term* and especially within *Christianity*. Apparently not many other religions have this concept of glory or we would have heard more about it. 

Wikipedia describes is most simply and #todo/opzoeken/engels alomvattend: 
> **Glory** (from the Latin *gloria*, "fame, renown") is used to describe the manifestation of  [God's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Christianity)  presence as perceived by humans according to the  [Abrahamic religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religions) .  
In other words, when Christian use the word "glory" it is to describe God's manifestation. In this sense animals and heavenly bodies—in fact, everything that is created—carry God's manifestion because it is proof that God created this. Only those things that do have not been created by him, such as evil and sin, do not carry God's manifestation and hence do not give Him glory. 
Speaking of carrying, as mentioned elsewhere in my notes, Dennis Prager #tags/famouspeople mentioned in his eponymous commentary on Exodus #tags/books that the third of the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 actually means #composed/bible/exodus
> 7 “You shall not *carry* the name of the LORD your God in vain  
instead of 
> (ESV) 7 “You shall not *take* the name of the LORD your God in vain  
(emphasis added), in the same way that we carry our God's Name on us, as humans but especially when we are Christians and even more when we *say* we are Christians by using the Lord's name (small letters are used here on purpose, that is His name "Yahweh" and not His Name, which is His reputation).
 The other examples of *glory* by Merriam-Webster transpire the same idea by the way, such as 
> When she's acting she's in her *glory*.  
and 
> ancient Rome in its *glory*  
In both cases the woman and Rome, respectively, are manifested through something, these things being her acting and Rome's power and architecture for example. 

*42 So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable. 43 It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. 44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. 45 Thus it is written, “The first man Adam became a living being”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. 46 But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural, and then the spiritual.*

The bad thing must always come first. This holistic principe applies everything in life, as Paul has pointed out in the previous verses (e.g. from v.42 on). It also applies with humanity, namely that God could not plant spiritual humans in Eden and then have eternal paradise as He planned to. There had to be a moment when humanity would die out and that a new form of humanity, which is implied by the last Adam, Who is Jesus, would rise. 
This answers the question of why God did not make Adam good and perfectly sinless in the beginning. The answer is that He did, He even made Adam and Eve *very good* (Genesis 1: #todo/opzoeken ). But they were *able* to sin, nonetheless, because this is imposed by their free will, which is part of being "very good". For something cannot be very good without it having free will. An outside would not deem the situation "very good" of a child who obeys everything the parents tell them without having any free will of his own. 
But aside from this well-known argument, this Adam and his whole race, had to die and then be raised up with a spiritual body. 
Could God not have created the spiritual body immediately, just like He (perhaps) created flowers immediately and not first seeds on the Earth to let them die and then slowly grow? Perhaps He could have created us just as we will become on the New Earth, where there will be free will but no one will choose to anything wrong. The reason that there is no sin on the New Earth is that humans have been cleansed from the unrighteousness, and the reason for that is because God imputed this on them because of their faith in Jesus Christ. 
Why then would He not have made us completely righteous to begin with? Being righteous implies that one has a choice between the two options of unrighteous and righteousness. Even Adam, having been created completely clean and holy, still made wrong decisions, and so would we, because both he and we have never learned to make good decisions and suffer the consequence of that. But having learned this, regretted this and longing for a different life, God can now give us this new life, which is completely righteous again, but now with His Spirit in us in such a way that we will never sin again. 

*47 The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. 48 As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. 49 Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.*

Bodily we are of the man from the earth and spiritually we are of the second man from heaven. As for images, we bear both the image of the first and the second man. Note that v.49 uses a perfect tense (have borne) for the former image and a future tense (shall bear) for the latter image. What image are we bearing right now then? #biblestudy/questions


***Mystery and Victory***
*50 I tell you this, brothers: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. 51 Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall ::not all:: sleep, but we shall all be changed, 52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed.* #tags/theology/endtimes *53 For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. 54 When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written:*
*“Death is swallowed up in victory.”*

Regardless of the image we are bearing, our bodies must change, for this body that we have right now, will not be able to inherit the kingdom of God. It will not withstand God in His full glory, which is in which we will see Him after the last trumpet. 

*55 “O death, where is your victory?*
*O death, where is your sting?”*
*56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.*

Death cannot kill us unless he uses his sting, which is sin. We have power over our sin for we we have died to sin (see for example Romans 6:2,6,10-11) and we have been set free from all (consequences of) the sin we have done and still do. 
The **power of sin is the law**, but we are not under the law anymore, but under grace (Romans 6:14) and so this sin hast lost its power. 
Death can then be compared to a big enemy who uses a weapon with which he can shoot bullets of sin. These bullets have a driving force behind them, which is their kinetic energy obtained from gunpowder. But all of this only works under the laws of nature. This does not work for beings not under this law, such as spiritual beings.  
In the same way the stings of death or of Satan have no power over us, for they operate under the law, and even though we still live in this world, which is under the law, we have a way out, legally, under this law, which is the blood of Jesus Christ, which paid for all of our sins. 
So in a sense, we still are under this law, but it is like a person having done nothing wrong and does not have to fear the law. The difference between that person and us, however, is that this person is still afraid, or should be, because it is still possible for him to offend the law, while in our case, we know that we cannot offend the law anymore, because Jesus Christ paid for *all* of our sins, even our future ones, under the presumption that we regret everything, even in the future. So we can live *as if* we are not under the law. That is why Romans 6:11 says that you "must *consider* yourselves dead to sin" (emphasis added). 
We can live without this fear and that will change a *a lot*! People who live in fear base their decisions on completely other things than those who do not. That is why we see so much art and innovation in more developed countries, because they live without fear and choose a career which they like and are good at. Meanwhile in Indonesia, for example, almost all (Chinese) parents push their children to become doctors, lawyers or dentists—jobs in which there is security of having a job and minimum income, regardless of their children's interests and capabilities. 
Those who are free from the law can place their priorities in God. Even though we still need to eat, we put our career and work on a lower priority, because living is not the most important thing in life, but honoring God. Being free from the law of sin also means that we are not afraid to die, to lose status or go hungry. First of all because we know where we will go to after this life, but second of all because we know that not only we, but God as well do not operate under the law, not even under the laws of physics. God can create food from nothing and provide in any and every situation. Moreover, not only *can* he do so, He also *will* do so because He wants to take of His children.

Gedachte #biblestudy/theology/calvinism/osas
> Aanname 1. Als je spijt hebt van iets, dan vergeeft God het je.   
> Stelling 1. Op het moment dat we spijt hebben van al onze daden en ons *bekeren*, heeft Jezus voor eens en altijd *al* onze zonden vergeven, voor die van het verleden maar ook voor die van de toekomst.   
Echter, dit blijft onder de aanname dat je spijt moet hebben van je zonden. 
Iemand die op een gegeven moment, stel, drie jaren na zijn zogenaamde "bekering", een zonde begaat en daar geen spijt van heeft, zal niet vergeven worden voor die zonde. 
Stel nu dat deze persoon na drie jaar besluit (uit vrije wil) geen christen meer te willen zijn en Jezus niet meer te volgen. Zou hij dan vergeven zijn voor al zijn zonden in het verleden, tot op deze dag, maar voor de toekomst niet meer? Dit zou dan betekenen dat Stelling 1 niet meer klopt en dat we die moeten veranderen naar de volgende stelling.
> **Stelling 2. Op het moment dat we spijt hebben van al onze daden en *bekeerd* werden, heeft Jezus ~~voor eens en altijd~~ *sommige* van onze zonden vergeven, namelijk alleen voor die van het verleden, maar niet voor die van de toekomst.   
Maar is dit te vinden in de Bijbel? Of anders gezegd, is deze ondertoon te vinden, dat we geen zekerheid hebben voor de toekomst?  


*57 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.* 

This sin is still present in our lives, unfortunately, and oftentimes we are not strong enough to fight it successfully, which is shown in our pride, lust and other forms of temptations which we fall for. But this is a battle out of which we already know we will rise as victors *through our Lord Jesus Christ*. 

*58 Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.*

Here is another #todo/opzoeken/engels opsomming, list of three verbs or three shout-outs or even commands for Christians. We are to be **steadfast** because Christians should not be doubters like waves (James 1:6) but rather rooted in firm ground  ( #todo/opzoeken  reference, otherwise Psalm 1:3). This is like the next word **immovable**, but the difference between the two is that the steadfastness is like an object moving with constant speed, such as a mammoth tanker, #todo/opzoeken/engels which will go on regardless of (relatively small) obstacles, because of its mass. The immovability then is in its speed, not in its location.
In the case of Christians is that they should always be pursuing God, steadily, never slowing down, and nothing should hinder that progress. 
The third command is to be **always abounding in the work of the Lord**. There times when people put the workd of the Lord on a lower priority, because they need time for themselves, perhaps because of a career move or because of health issues. Others do this for more legitimate reasons such as their family who needs them. But in both cases the work of the Lord is interpreted as ministry within the church. The work of the Lord is much more than that, it is the carrying out of His commands and commission (#todo/opzoeken  love the Lord with all your heart etc. , Matthew 28:18-20). Taking care of your family is serving the Lord, and working hard to provide for your family is work for the Lord, even though one has a worldly master (cf. Colossians 3: #todo/opzoeken reference work heartily, as for the Lord and not for man. You serve the Lord Christ"). However, when this is done with the wrong intention it is always wrong, whatever one is doing. See Colossians 3 again for the reference to the bondservant who does this for eyeservice, without sincerity of heart. 
Christian should also know **that in the Lord** their **labor is not in vain**. Just like everything that God allows to happen is for the good of His children (Romans 8:28), in the same way His children's labor will never be in vain.

**Example.** At the moment a sister in our church is on the verge of a miscarriage, either that or her child will be born very prematurely and suffer developmental issues, just like her first child. She is in much distress right now and seems to be moved by this issue in such a way that she cannot sense God's goodness in this. 
Even though this is very common and understandable, it is still clear that she is not steadfast here. And if she is not steadfast, but rather slowing down, she is movable and lessening the amount of her labor as well. Her labor could be on the field of prayer, it would not matter what it is, it is less than when she had been steadfast.
