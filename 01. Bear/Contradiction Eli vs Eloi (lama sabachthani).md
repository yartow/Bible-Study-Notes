# Contradiction: Eli vs Eloi (lama sabachthani)

 Example of Mk 15:34 and Mt 27:46, where Matthew says "Eli", but Mark says "Eloi" (Aramaic). Which is true?
It is not that they remembered it differently, for the Holy Spirit inspired them in writing this, i.e. these words and using this language. 
Take for example the term "good evening". In Chinese this would be 晚安. Suppose an Englishman said "good evening" and two Chinese writers recorded it in their diaries. One could have used "晚安" which is the correct and traditional translation in Chinese while the other could have used "晚上好" which is a literal but colloquial translation. Both of them did not remember differently, but they wanted to bring across a different message. The former wanted to translate as good as possible, while the latter wants the reader to know what the Englishman approximately said, for "晚安" and "晚上好" truly have different meanings. The latter means the same as in English while the former means "peace in your evening".
