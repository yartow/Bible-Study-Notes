# Proverbs 31
Proverbs 31:1-9 (NIV)
1 The sayings of King Lemuel—an inspired utterance his mother taught him.
2 Listen, my son! Listen, son of my womb!
Listen, my son, the answer to my prayers!
3 Do not spend your strength on women,
your vigor on those who ruin kings.

Forgive me, Father, for having committed this sin in my life over and over again, with it having had great consequences on my life. I have spent my time and money on woman, but most importantly, I had given up part of my love for You for them.
My will belongs to You, not to women. Cleanse me and purify me so that not only I will not make that mistake again, but also will I help others to prevent from committing that sin.
Heal me, so that I may tell others about Your amazing works and about the wonderful God You Whom I serve.

4 It is not for kings, Lemuel—
it is not for kings to drink wine,
not for rulers to crave beer,
5 lest they drink and forget what has been decreed,
and deprive all the oppressed of their rights.

6 Let beer be for those who are perishing,
wine for those who are in anguish!
7 Let them drink and forget their poverty
and remember their misery no more.

8 Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves,
for the rights of all who are destitute.
9 Speak up and judge fairly;
defend the rights of the poor and needy.

In some positions it is not for a person to drink alcohol or to enjoy that which others can. A king has a duty to take care of his people. He has a lot of responsibilities and honor as well.
So it is with us, we get a lot of honor in the positions we carry out a humans, but also as sons of God.
It may seem like a lot to give up, but the honor and pleasure we have of serving God is much greater than what life on this world can offer.

A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies.

It is indeed rare and difficult to find such as a wide. Moreover, most of these wives still need to be formed and will become all or some of the below as soon as they are married and get into the right situations which form her.
In any case, she is worth far more than rubies, or than what we see in this world, worth more than a great body and a good pair of brains.

Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value.
She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life.

We, men, long a lot from our wives. Seeing all of the things below this woman must be like a super woman. And as said above, only some women are able to be like that.
But all women, when treated rightly, and when in their right mind, bring husbands good, not harm.

She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands.
She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar.
She gets up while it is still night; she provides food for her family and portions for her female servants.

A woman of noble character is skilled and not afraid to work with her hands. But most important is that she is eager to do so. She is not resistant but well willing to work hard for her family.
She is also a woman of quality, she will not simply make clothes, no, the clothes she makes, must be of good quality.

She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard.
She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks.

A woman should be entrepreneurial, some in bigger businesses, others in farms or even smaller things, but something must happen in order to keep the family alive and help the husband.
The fact that us written that her arms are strong, must be read together with "for her tasks". So she has the skills fitting to what she can do best. Perhaps it is her mouth, or her ears, but she will be equipped for her skills and tasks, because God has created her.

She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night. In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers.

Besides her talents and guts, what is important for a wife is that she works hard. This is something that no one can deny or blame God for. No one can blame God that he does not work hard himself, for that is purely our own responsibility.
And a woman who works hard and long hours, shows her determination for her husband and children.
In this way it is also clearly visible that it is not the man who does most of the work by far, no, they are working equally hard to provide for the family.

She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy.
When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet.

Now we get to the part where her heart is I involved. Not only does she love her things for her own benefit, but she also loves others whom God has commanded us to love.
And she will not easily be scared, or has enough courage to go on despite being scared, for she knows what is most important.
In other words, her priorities and her heart are in the right place.

She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple.

As for looks, she does her best to make the house look good and herself as well.
Perhaps for her husband, but it is also part of who she is and what she is. A noble woman respects what God has given her, and if good looks are part of it, she will use it.
But as for the former, the next verse says something about the husband.

Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.

The husband is respected and has a prominent, yet responsible position. Not only for this reason, but partly because of it, she represent his family and needs to give a good impression of his care and leadership.
For if a man's leadership is not good enough to lead his family, why would anyone trust him to be able to lead a city or nation?
As an addition of the MacArthur study Bible notes, it is perhaps because of the woman that the man has such high honor in the city.

She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes.

The noble wife is able to make clothes and provide for herself.

She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come.

The character of a noble woman is one of strength. Even in bad times she will not give up, she will stay strong to be a good example to her family, especially for her children.
She is not afraid of bad days, she laughs at them, because she believes in God.

She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.

She is wise as well, because she is smart. She learns from her mistakes, and therefore achieves wisdom. She is also eager to teach others.

She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.

The noble wife even watches what her husband does for his work. Perhaps she is not as educated as he is, but she does understand a lot of social aspects of it.
In any case, she will not be doing nothing, but in any way she can help, she will do her best.

Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:
“Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.”

Like Nathan always says that his mom is the most beautiful in the whole world, I too should praise her. Also, I should let her know that she is better than other women, not because of her capabilities, because there is always someone in the world who can do better.

TODO Praise Sandra

Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
Honor her for all that her hands have done, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.
Proverbs 31:10‭-‬31 NIV
[http://bible.com/111/pro.31.10-31.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.31.10-31.NIV)

A woman who can work a man with charm, is not a happy one, because she knows that her husband only listens to her deceptive words and tricks. Does the man really do something out of love for her? She does not know.
If a man loves her for her beauty, then will he love her just as much when her beauty is gone?
The answer is no. But a woman who fears the Lord, is the kind of woman we should look for. If you are married to such a woman, you are very lucky.
In my case I am, but I did not realize how lucky I was.

A woman does a lot with her hands, she should be honored for that.
The woman has given up beautiful feet and hands to honor her husband. He should repay that with his love and honor for her. And let all this bring her praise in the congregation and even further than that.
