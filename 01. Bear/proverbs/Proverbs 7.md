# Proverbs 7
*My son, keep my words and store up my commands within you.*

Why did Solomon of all people warn us about adultery and wayward women? I have two reasons for that.
It could be that his wives were not wayward.
Secondly, officially he never committed adultery. But according to God he has. Both in the case of women as well as worshipping other gods.
Either way, he knew the consequences, so that makes him just the right person to warn us of them.
On the other hand, he is less trustworthy and authoritive, because he does not show regret near the end of his life.

*Keep my commands and you will live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.*
*Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.*

Lord, I see that I have to guard your teachings, not loosely, but like the apple of my eye. It is fragile, it cannot be unprotected for a second.
Perhaps I have defended Celebrate Recovery in a wrong way yesterday, but partially hurting the relationship between Johannes and me, and that - relationships - happen to be the core of your teaching.
Lord, help me to bind your rule on my fingers, so that I will not forget this ever again. Let nothing come in between You and me, nor between my brothers and sisters and me.

*Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and to insight, “You are my relative.”*
*They will keep you from the adulterous woman, from the wayward woman with her seductive words.*
*Proverbs 7:1-5 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.7.1-5.NIV*

I must never make enemies with wisdom and insight. In the past I have ignored them and argued with them or even debated them. Thank God they are still willing to be my family.

*At the window of my house I looked down through the lattice.*
*I saw among the simple, I noticed among the young men, a youth who had no sense.*
*He was going down the street near her corner, walking along in the direction of her house*
*at twilight, as the day was fading, as the dark of night set in.*
*Proverbs 7:6-9 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.7.6-9.NIV*

That is the image of a young person without sense entering the house of a prostitute. The questions are why nobody is stopping this youth, because it unlawful to lie with a prostitute. And why does everyone know where the prostitute lives? It is the community that accepts this, that allows this kind of behavior.

At he same time he is doing it at twilight, not letting everyone know, so it is a taboo, but an allowed one.

Of the thousand wives Solomon had, would there be one that has temple prostitution? If so, then I am wondering when he wrote these Proverbs.

TODO OPZOEKEN in Kings whether there was temple prostitution in Solomon's time.

*Then out came a woman to meet him, dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent. (She is unruly and defiant, her feet never stay at home; now in the street, now in the squares, at every corner she lurks.)*

The woman appears not to be even a prostitute, but rather a wayward woman. She is dressed like a prostitute though and has crafty intent. She is even worse than a prostitute in a sense.

*She took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said:*
*“Today I fulfilled my vows, and I have food from my fellowship offering at home.*

I am not sure if she had an offering to God or another god, but if it is to God, that makes her even worse. Having sex with a man not yours right after a fellowship with God.

*So I came out to meet you; I looked for you and have found you!*
*I have covered my bed with colored linens from Egypt.*
*I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.*
*Come, let’s drink deeply of love till morning; let’s enjoy ourselves with love!*
*My husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.*
*He took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon.”*
*Proverbs 7:10-20 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.7.10-20.NIV*

It is partially the man who went towards the woman, it is he woman who draws him in, but it is the man who admits.
Do not go even near her, or she will tempt you. Stay far away from her, and there is nothing she can do from a distance.

*With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk.*
*All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose*
*till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life.*
*Proverbs 7:21-23 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.7.21-23.NIV*

Smooth talk is how the devil misleads us, but too much we are willing to believe it because we want it too badly.
Stop chasing and feeling your lust, and the devil has nothing to tempt you with.
Gain God's wisdom and you will know what will cost you your life.

*Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say.*
*Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths.*

It is a fair warning to not stray into her paths. Without knowing so we will listen to ourselves too much and at the same causing victims.

*Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng.*
*Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death.*
*Proverbs 7:24-27 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.7.24-27.NIV*

It is a highway in the sense that it leads in one direction only and there is no way to stop or get off, only at certain moments, but when you have passed the last exit, you will end up there for sure.
In the original translation it says roads instead of highways, but I find it very applicable, because on a road as well, except for the speed, and the fact one can turn around (in these days), it still heads for one direction.
