# Proverbs 30 test4
*The sayings of Agur son of Jakeh—an inspired utterance. This manʼs utterance to Ithiel: “I am weary, God, but I can prevail.* 

Yes, I am weary as well, of this world and everything that is happening in it. Not only what is happening to me and my surroundings, but also to see what is going on in the rest of the world.
I am not sure what is meant by prevailing, I know the word, but I would not say that I prevail, for it is God Who prevails.

*Surely I am only a brute, not a man; I do not have human understanding.*
