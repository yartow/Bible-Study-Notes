# Proverbs 2
***Proverbs 2***
***Moral Benefits of Wisdom***
*1 My son, if you accept my words*
*and store up my commands within you,*
*2 turning your ear to wisdom*
*and applying your heart to understanding—*
*3 indeed, if you call out for insight*
*and cry aloud for understanding,*
*4 and if you look for it as for silver*
*and search for it as for hidden treasure,*
*5 then you will understand the fear of the Lord*
*and find the knowledge of God.*

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, but how do I start fearing the Lord? The Lord Himself gives us the answer through Solomon.
First, accept His Words and store up my commands within me. --> Memorize His words
Second, turning my ear and applying my heart to understanding --> that is listening to the right things and setting my heart to understand it. It is to be noted that I can choose what I listen to and that I can *set* what my heart longs for. Sure, one might say that his heart longs for entertainment through the internet more than reading the Bible. That might be true and very honest, but one can control his heart by removing this entertainment. This is not as simple as turning it off for one night. No, our longings are buried deep in our hearts and we need to starve them. Stop entertaining yourself for a whole week, or more when needed, in order to let these longings die. Then the longing for God and His Word will come by itself. 

*6 For the Lord gives wisdom;*
*from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.*

*The Lord gives wisdom. This sentence is worth so much more than meets the eye. See the next verse, one single verse can give so much insight. Depending on the situation you are in, it can be a whole other explanation. In my case it is about finding a job, related to successfulness. Charles Bridges* *wrote a whole book about the Proverbs, more then 300 pages, and that still is not the end.*
And what about knowledge and understanding, two other terms that can change the way you view life. Wisdom lets me know whether I should or should not do something, knowledge lets me know something I did not know before, understanding puts me in a position where I can feel the feelings necessary from another person's point of view in order to make the right decision.

*7 He holds success in store for the upright,*
*he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,*

The Lord knows about success, He understands all about it. The Lord Himself came to Earth to see what success is, having met rich men like Zaccheus and Matthew, and knowing their weaknesses at the same time. Jesus knew that success in a worldly fashion is not what man needs. True success is bringing glory to God with whatever God has given you. Whether it is with your hands or feet, by creating something or serving someone, your body or your voice, to glorify God through sports or music and the sanctification of your temple, or your spirit or mind, by dying for Jesus or teaching others about him, that is succes, if you have given all with all you have got.

*8 for he guards the course of the just*
*and protects the way of his faithful ones.*

Why does God do all this, why does He give us so much, giving us succes and being a shield for us? No specific reason why except that He guards the course of the just and faithful ones.
In my interpretation, the love and fear for the Lord come first, but being just and faithful must have a very prominent place in our lives as well.

*Then you will understand what is right and just and fair—every good path.*

Then comes the question, what is right and just and fair? I do not even know the difference between right and just. But the answer is *every good path*. 

*For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.*

In the Dutch SV translation we read that we will understand *if* wisdom enters our heart and - my translation - *when* knowledge is pleasant to the soul. For if one does not like knowledge, how can he understand what righteousness is? 

*Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you.*
*Proverbs 2:9-11 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.2.9-11.NIV*

Discretion will protect me when I talk with others, it will help me with choosing my words. Understanding will guard me, for it will show me the correct estimation of risk.
Help me in my work, Lord, to understand both his situation, as well as mine and to be discreet about my conditions but setting the right conditions.

*Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse, who have left the straight paths to walk in dark ways, who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil, whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways.*
*Proverbs 2:12-15 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/* *pro.2.12-15.NIV*

Being saved from the ways of wicked men might mean something else than I thought. This might even mean that someone who is innocent might be offered something, a deal or a purchase, by someone, who might not even be wicked at all, but his boss might be, and this salesman is unaware that he is part of a wicked scheme.
But wisdom will save this customer.
Lord, help me seeing through this situation I am in right now and give me strength to make the right decision when it comes to it.

*Wisdom will save you also from the adulterous woman, from the wayward woman with her seductive words,*

Wisdom will save us from the adulterous woman. Not only is she tempting, but she can only tempt men when they are longing for a woman like that. Wisdom will protect men from giving in to their own lusts.

*who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God.*

It will show us how wicked she is, to even ignore the covenant she made *before* God! Likewise, we tend to forget our own covenants and promises we made with and before God. And we surely will break our covenant as soon as we let ourselves be seduced by this woman. 

*Surely her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead. None who go to her return or attain the paths of life.*
*Proverbs 2:16-19 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.2.16-19.NIV*

Even though we know all of the above, that she is adulterous, that she ignored her covenant with God, we still need a warning about what will happen. So stubbornness is in us!
But the Lord answers that her house will lead us to death and even death in the afterlife, which is hell, and none can return.

*Thus you will walk in the ways of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.*
I do not know why it says that *you* will walk in the ways of the good, is it referring to the reader who is reading in the book of wisdom? But not every reader will embrace this wisdom, right? 

*For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it;*
*but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it.*
*Proverbs 2:20-22 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.2.20-22.NIV*

There is no path in between, you either live in the land, remain in it, or you will be *cut off* and *torn*  **from it** *.*
It is not possible to stay on the land and live as a beggar, or to live there as a stranger.
