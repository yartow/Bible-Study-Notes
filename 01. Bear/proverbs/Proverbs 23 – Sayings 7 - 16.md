# Proverbs 23 – Sayings 7 - 16
***Saying 7***

*When you sit to dine with a ruler, note well what is before you, and put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony. Do not crave his delicacies, for that food is deceptive.*
*Proverbs 23:1‭-‬3 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.23.1-3.NIV*

This is a hard proverb to understand. It is first of all saying that the food of a ruler is deceptive. In what way?
It might be a test, to see if you are given to gluttony, hence the warning to out your own knife to your throat to at least not by gluttonous in front of the ruler.
So not crave what kings have, richness, power, slaves, and women, human authority and food. These are all things of the world. You had rather kill yourself figuratively than to crave for these things, or at least threat yourself with death. These kind of things are deceptive and may think you are safe, having peace and are happy and content, but you are not.
 
 
***Saying 8***
*Do not wear yourself out to get rich; do not trust your own cleverness. Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle.*
*Proverbs 23:4‭-‬5 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.23.4-5.NIV*

I have seen many cases where riches fly off like a bird. In most cases these people are even worse off than before they were rich. Having become accustomed to the style of living rich, they cannot revert to a normal lifestyle anymore when they are not.
Almost all cases where someone wins the power ball lottery of the United States end up with the person spending all the money in a few years.
Remember that we are but ambassadors of the Kingdom of God and the riches in that world, to which we should be accustomed, are not those of this world. They are riches of friendliness and kindness, of gentleness and goodness.
When we become accustomed to this world we lose the riches of the other world and vice versa.

***Saying 9***
*Do not eat the food of a begrudging host, do not crave his delicacies; for he is the kind of person who is always thinking about the cost. “Eat and drink,” he says to you, but his heart is not with you.*
*You will vomit up the little you have eaten and will have wasted your compliments.*
*Eccles. 23:6‭-‬8 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.23.6-8.NIV*

I know I am cheap and that I try to save as much money as possible. It has to do with the amount of money I have myself as well, which is not much, but also with the fact that I am not a happy sharer. I have not fully incorporated *Giving is better than receiving* from Acts 25 in my lifestyle. God, please help me do so. 
Except for myself this verse reminded me of my uncle in Singapore as well, who was on a tight budget, but started talking to me, or to himself, about all the high costs in Singapore. After a long rant and a long walk we arrived in a place where they sold noodle soup and he asked me what I wanted.
He said *order whatever you want, it's my treat* but it did not feel like that at all. I did not order anything because of all the things he said before, for how can I enjoy a person's treat if he has so much problems with getting around? 

What the author probably means with *vomits up* is that someday this begrudging host, which means he is not willing to give anything, will ask you for a favor in return. Even though you only ate a little bit of his food, he will ask all of it back and perhaps even more. Your thanksgiving and compliments will have been for nothing. In other words, your efforts for him end up in vain. 
Do not believe that everything you do will have its rewards. Most certainly it will not always have its reward in humans.

***Saying 10***
*Do not speak to fools, for they will scorn your prudent words.*
*Proverbs 23:9 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.23.9.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.23.9.NIV)*

If only I had known these Proverbs 30 years earlier, I would have saved myself from so much mess. I have spent so much of my words on skunk in bad neighborhoods, which all ended up in deep wells.

***Saying 11***
*Do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the fields of the fatherless, for their Defender is strong; he will take up their case against you.*
*Proverbs 23:10‭-‬11 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.23.10-11.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.23.10-11.NIV)*

The boundary stone mentioned earlier is mentioned here again, but perhaps for a different boundary. This boundary is referring to the people who should definitely not be encroached.

***Saying 12***
*Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge.* 

Some people say *I have to follow my heart.* Your heart is indeed the nest of your desires and if they are good ones, you should definitely follow them. But we can set our desires as well, with God's strength. 
God says in Colossians 3:1

*Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.*

The same thing goes for our eyes, as in 2 Corinthians 4:18 (NIV)

*So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.*

So we apply our hearts to instructions. We give it the desire to follow instructions and want to know more instructions.
How do we do that? In the same way as we have let our hearts get other desires. By exposing our hearts to it and letting them see the positive and satisfying outcomes.
Our hearts have, however, seen the short term effects of pleasure and entertainment, which it therefore desires, but not the long term effects, which are laziness and confirmation to this world.
But if you expose it to diligence and show that it might be giving up on some things, in the long run it pays off in much more fields. Plus, it is something that pleases the Lord.

What about our ears? Literally you cannot put your ears up to do anything, they will just listen to whatever they are exposed to. But you can choose what you will expose your ears to most of the time.
So choose wisdom and listen to it, choose good sermons or videos from YouTube and listen to the words.

Les over..? Heart is mind, kidneys is soul.

***Saying 13***
*Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish them with the rod, they will not die. Punish them with the rod and save them from death.* 

The Western world is wrong in thinking that corporal punishment is a bad thing perse.
As this verse says, if we have to choose between life and death for our child, we should choose life, even if that includes punishment with the rod.

***Saying 14***
*My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad indeed; my inmost being will rejoice when your lips speak what is right.*
*Proverbs 23:12‭-‬16 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.23.12-16.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.23.12-16.NIV)*
 
 
*This* is something I would like to give to my sin as an inheritance, namely that my heart will be glad if his is wise. I do not care if he is safe or happy, what I care about is his wisdom. For when he is wise he will choose the right path, which is that of God, and out of that will lead peace and joy, not happiness perse, but the more important things in life will show. 
 
 
***Saying 15***
*Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the Lord . There is surely a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off.*

If I can add more to what I want give to my son it would be this saying, but it is partially included in the previous saying.
In my life I have followed and envied other people far too often. Even the good persons I have followed and imitated. I imitate people from the movies, I want I follow those who are popular in my class or in church. I could never just be myself, because I thought I was not cool enough.
The problem with that thought is not that I am cool or not, the problem is that being cool is not the important thing.
I might have followed some person's correctly by coincidence, but for the wrong reasons. For the reason for which I should follow someone is *God-fearing*. I should praise the God-fearing attitude of some of those and imitate that, even if the persons are not cool. And in most cases I believe these people are not cool. They are poor, or have chosen poverty as in the case of many evangelists, get beaten up and tortured, they do not *look* cool or have cool accomplishments or cool muscular bodies. 
 
 
So first, I should praise the God-fearing attitude, second I need to have hope. Not hope that I will be cool one day, but hope that I am already part of God's family and that whatever sinners have that I do not have, that the underlying need for it will be filled, if it is good.
 
 
***Saying 16***
*Listen, my son, and be wise, and set your heart on the right path: Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat, for drunkards and gluttons become poor, and drowsiness clothes them in rags.*
 
 
To continue from the previous saying, do not join others in their behavior in order to be part of their group and "cool" in as well. In our times many want to become muscular and therefore eat lots of meat, they also drink lots of beer during parties.
Eventually they will become poor. Perhaps they will have moment of richness, but they will spend it like water.
A rare few will either keep their money or earn very much, but even they will be poor yet in other currency. In spiritual currency that is, they will lack the fruit of the Holy Spirit, and lose God's favor and blessings as well. This will lead to a lack of peace and joy and with it satisfaction, which they will try to compensate with money and sex. Eventually they will go to drugs, because that stimulates the brain even more than sex, causing them to lose the most important thing they have in this world except for their soul and the relationship with God, which they had already lost, the relationships with family and friends.
The latter will also cause them to lose their children, sometimes by physical death, because of their bad example, but almost always by spiritual death as described in Saying 13. Their children are not punished and most certainly not by godly standards, so how could they live with God?
