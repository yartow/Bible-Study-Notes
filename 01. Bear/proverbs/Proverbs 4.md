# Proverbs 4
*Listen, my sons, to a father’s instruction; pay attention and gain understanding.*
*I give you sound learning, so do not forsake my teaching.*
*For I too was a son to my father, still tender, and cherished by my mother.*
*Then he taught me, and he said to me, “Take hold of my words with all your heart; keep my commands, and you will live.*
*Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or turn away from them.*
*Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will watch over you.*
*The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding.*

Unfortunately Solomon's sons did not listen to their father's wisdom. Apparently actions spoke louder than words. But a good thing it was that Solomon did listen to his father and got wisdom as his very first wish from God.
Solomon is right in saying *get it, whatever it costs* because it is worth more than anything else. Solomon could have wished for anything, and he could have lost or not obtain everything he did not wish for, but it would be worth it. 
On the other hand it might cost a lot of time and money to obtain wisdom, but still do it.

*Cherish her, and she will exalt you; embrace her, and she will honor you.*
*She will give you a garland to grace your head and present you with a glorious crown.”*
*Proverbs 4:1-9 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.4.1-9.NIV*

We should not do things for honor for ourselves, but this verse is explaining what it will do. Wisdom will exalt you, it means that we will grow. She will honor you, which means that we can move freely without worrying about doing unwise things all the time.
A person just learning how to drive, keeps thinking if he is doing anything wrong or trespassing any rules. The rules are new to him, he does not know all of them and cannot behave naturally.
Just so it is with someone who is new to wisdom. When one learns what wisdom is, he does not behave naturally and moves very carefully. But when he has embraced wisdom he can things (almost) blindly. That is when wisdom honors him.

*Listen, my son, accept what I say, and the years of your life will be many.*
*I instruct you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths.*
*When you walk, your steps will not be hampered; when you run, you will not stumble.*

Wisdom will lead me along straight paths, the shortest paths. Why take the hard road when the easy road is just as well?
My steps will not hampered. In order to move faster I need to get rid of stumbling over all the people around me. I need wisdom to implement my ideas.

*Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; guard it well, for it is your life.*

Wisdom is our lifeline, we cannot let it go. It is like our most value possession, like our mobile phone is this age. We cannot pay, get information or access, or even read the Bible without it.

*Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evildoers.*
*Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it and go on your way.*

I must keep away from the evildoers. Avoid they're path altogether, turn away from it. I was dangerously close to it by pursuing my wishes, ignoring the importance of relationships.
Lord, keep giving me wisdom, for I need it to know Your will.
  
*For they cannot rest until they do evil; they are robbed of sleep till they make someone stumble.*
*They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.*
*Proverbs 4:10-17 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.4.10-17.NIV*

The wicked are recognizable by their behavior, they cannot rest until they have accomplished what they wanted to. As said, I was dangerously near the wicked. I could almost not rest until I had my plans set.
Lord, teach me to be patient and caring, empathic and understanding other's and my own weaknesses.

*The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day. But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble.*
*Proverbs 4:18-19 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.4.18-19.NIV*

The difference between my mistake and that of the wicked is that I know, because God told me through His Holy Spirit, what made me stumble.
And the path of the righteous that shines ever brighter is something we cannot imagine until we are there. But as wise as we think we are, so much more wiser will we be in the future if we stay righteous.

*My son, pay attention to what I say; turn your ear to my words.*
**D** **o** *not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart;*
*for they are life to those who find them and health to one’s whole body.*

I pray that my beloved ones around me will find wisdom. Wisdom must be searched for, it is not wide in the open

*Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.*

Whatever I do, I must guard my heart. In my heart are my morals, there is all of my love, I just make sure that everything I do happens out of love.

*Keep your mouth free of perversity; keep corrupt talk far from your lips.*
*Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you.*

So we fix our eyes on what is unseen and what is eternal. Lord, let my gaze be fixed on whatever you place before me. Let me not do wrong in my ways to reach Your goals.

*Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways.*
*Do not turn to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.*
*Proverbs 4:20-27 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.4.20-27.NIV*

Now God wants me to be even more careful, that is to mind my every step and the path I am walking on. Both the direction as the method are important.
If I am using the right method I should not refrain or deviate from it.

I am missing something, this verse says "give careful thought". Before walking I need to give careful thought to what I am going to do. That is what I have neglected to do, and I got into action right away.
