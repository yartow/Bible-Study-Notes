# Proverbs 22:4
*PRO 22:4 NIV*

*Humility is the fear of the Lord ; its wages are riches and honor and life.*

Not just riches and honor. Even if I were to think I had rather not have riches and honor in order to have a less difficult life while not being humble, I could not choose it, for humbleness *gives* life.
