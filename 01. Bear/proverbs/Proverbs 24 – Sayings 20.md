# Proverbs 24 – Sayings 20
***Saying 20***
*Do not envy the wicked, do not desire their company; for their hearts plot violence, and their lips talk about making trouble.*

The wicked always seem like people I want to follow, but that is only because I would like to be like them and have what they have. Not the wicked part, but everything that comes with it. Just like Saul Alinskey enjoyed the pleasures of gangsters when he hanged out with them.
But both the pleasures they have as well as the things they do to obtain these, such as theft, are wicked.
Violence and trouble is what God wants us to get rid of. This is what makes us different from other religions. We see that Muslims in the Netherlands say the Islam is a peaceful religion, and Hindus say the same, but we see in practice that Christians worldwide are being attacked by Muslims and Hindus, and even Buddhists, who are not even extremists. Extremists use bombs and kill people, but the non extremist religious people still drive out, bully and discriminate Christians.
Christians do not use violence and do not cause trouble. This is something that should be known about us. Too few people know we are being persecuted, but too few people know we do not use violence either.

***Saying 21***
*By wisdom a house is built, and through understanding it is established; through knowledge its rooms are filled with rare and beautiful treasures.*
 
 
Wisdom, understanding and knowledge. I did not know there was anything in between wisdom and knowledge.
If I have to give an example, I would say wisdom will tell you in a specific situation what to say and when and how to say it. Knowledge refers more to the *what-* part and can extend and elaborate on that. 
But understanding would probably refer to the *why-* part *,* such as why would something not be a good moment to say things? 
 
 
***Saying 22***
*The wise prevail through great power, and those who have knowledge muster their strength.*
*Surely you need guidance to wage war, and victory is won through many advisers.*
*Proverbs 24:1‭-‬6 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.24.1-6.NIV*

As we know from the history of warfare, every war, I dare to say – though I cannot base it on anything, but just from what I have read about wars on Quora – is ultimately won by strategy.
This is most obviously seen in the tactics of the German general strategist... without whom Hitler would never have won many battles and it is also because of neglecting his advice that Hitler ultimately lost the war.

In our case we have many spiritual battles to engage in, which take place on this world. The real enemy is the Satan but he uses human puppets or shields, if you will.
Our power and strength is from the Lord and so is our guidance, ultimately. That does not mean, however, that we do no have to do anything at all.
As for strength, we need to equip ourselves with Bible knowledge and the armor of the Holy Spirit. As for strategy, we need to pray a lot for guidance in knowing how to attack the devil without hurting "his" people, which are actually God's people.

***Saying 23***
*Wisdom is too high for fools; in the assembly at the gate they must not open their mouths.*
 
 
Could it be that wisdom might be too difficult to comprehend for some? For fools most certainly, but eventually God wants fools to get nearer to Him as well. How are fools ever able then to get knowledge and wisdom?

***Saying 24***
*Whoever plots evil will be known as a schemer. The schemes of folly are sin, and people detest a mocker.*
*Proverbs 24:7‭-‬9 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.24.7-9.NIV*

The NIV uses one word for plans and thoughts, schemes, while it uses two words for foolishness, Folly and fools, as opposed to the SV 1750. Which one is correct?
Whatever the case, it is clear that the proverbist is saying that fools should not create plans for if they do, it is sin, by definition of this verse. In Dutch it even says that the thoughts alone are sins.
Of course all of our thoughts are sins as well if we did not have God influencing our thoughts and accepting our thoughts with His mercy, which has only been made possible through the blood of Jesus Christ.

***Saying 25***
*If you falter in a time of trouble, how small is your strength!*
*Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter.*
*If you say, “But we knew nothing about this,” does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay everyone according to what they have done?*
*Proverbs 24:10‭-‬12 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.24.10-12.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.24.10-12.NIV)*

This saying makes a judgment a judgment of those who falter in times of trouble. Of course it depends on the size of this trouble but I think that the word *trouble* already indicates a type of *problem* as opposed to a *disaster*. 
Faltering is always as a consequence of not enough strength or might, which is power. Of course it is not we who should have this strength (or in that case energy) and power, but God, yet we should have enough strength to at least call upon our Lord.
The second part tells us to stop those who are about to destroy themselves. In fact that would be every non-believer. No, that is not completely true, for it says "slaughter" and "being *led*", which means someone else is doing it. Some of the non-believers choose to follow the Satan themselves, even if they are misled, but some are actively pulled away by him. It is that group of people we need to rescue and hold back. 
The third part seems like an apology for when we have not withheld those being led away. For the group that really is innocent there is an apology, God knew you did not know that these persons were being led away by the devil. However, the verse says nothing about knowing it and not having enough strength to save the person. I think previous verse says enough about that.
On the other hand God also know when you are lying and saying that you did not know. He will repay for what the wicked have done, what the Satan has done, but also for what you have *not* done. 

***Saying 26***
*Eat honey, my son, for it is good; honey from the comb is sweet to your taste.*
*Know also that wisdom is like honey for you: If you find it, there is a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off.*
*Proverbs 24:13‭-‬14 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.24.13-14.NIV*

Honey, though it may come from wild insects is healthy provides a lot of nutrition. I need to figure out how much it actually gives, but I think it contains calories, proteins and many other things which cause it to not become moldy.
It also is hard to obtain, not always hanging on trees but sometimes in far fetched places.
Besides that there is a big chance you will get stung and hurt.
And so obtaining wisdom comes at a price. It requires hard work and obedience to God, which may cause you to be hurt by those who do not understand and fear God. But when you have it, you realize it is so much more than knowledge only.
It contains value to keep you alive, to let you grow and it will never perish.

But that is the part about wisdom itself, what it is and what it does for you. However, about finding wisdom, if you do, it means there is hope for a better future. It means there is still a way for you to connect to God. For if you have not found wisdom you can be sure that your future will not look bright. For without wisdom your money will be spent like water, your beloved will walk in the roads to hell and you will not know it in time, because you did not have wisdom. Your house will be empty because you spent your time not with your children or your wife, but with so called friends who abandoned you as soon as things were bad for you.

***Saying 27***
*Do not lurk like a thief near the house of the righteous, do not plunder their dwelling place; for though the righteous fall seven times, they rise again, but the wicked stumble when calamity strikes.*
*Proverbs 24:15‭-‬16 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.24.15-16.NIV*

If you try to hurt the righteous they will rise again, so first of all it is futile and a waste of your time, second of all God will punish you.
One punishment that all the wicked have already, is their lack of resilience. *They stumble when calamity strikes.* Just once it needs to strike and they are out, while the righteous can be struck seven times and still rise. 
This resilience is seen in many stories of poor and righteous people, how they managed to be successful in the world by working hard.
Unfortunately we see many stories where the wicked have this resilient and diligent attitude as well, such a *Goodfellas*, *Casino* and *Scarface*. #tags/movies These stories do show us how each respective protagonist's life ends, and it does not end well for all of them, but it does not show exactly what God is doing as their punishment. If people knew that, they would probably not want to become like Henry Hill #todo/opzoeken or Scarface.

***Saying 28***
*Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice, or the Lord will see and disapprove and turn his wrath away from them.*
*Proverbs 24:17‭-‬18 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.24.17-18.NIV*

This is one thing I have to learn. When my enemies fail, it hurts God and it should hurt me as well. For God wanted them become part of His family, but they rejected Him.
Understanding God's feelings is wisdom and is in most cases contrary to what the world does and feels.
Aside from this God will take away my enemies' punishment, if I gloat over their fall, which will even make my life worse, especially of God then decides to put this punishment on me, such as in the case of Rehabeam.

***Saying 29***
*Do not fret because of evildoers or be envious of the wicked, for the evildoer has no future hope, and the lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out.*
*Proverbs 24:19‭-‬20 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.24.19-20.NIV*

This verse is what has given me part of the peace, all of my life, when I saw others having partners, girlfriends in my case, or money, talents or status. I say part, because putting my hope in that they have no future hope, is not the best way of gaining peace. It is a rather vengeful thought.
The real way of gaining peace is to get rid of this jealousy and lust. Jealous because others have more than I do, and lust for pleasure and sloth, because with money I could do all I want (I want to be in control of everything), I could skip most things I do not want to do (such as cleaning and cooking) and I could have all I want (no more patience, diligence and perseverance needed).
In fact, getting all of this would be very bad for me. So I should be glad instead, that I do not have what the evildoers and wicked have.

***Saying 30***
*Fear the Lord and the king, my son, and do not join with rebellious officials, for those two will send sudden destruction on them, and who knows what calamities they can bring?*
*Proverbs 24:21‭-‬22 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.24.21-22.NIV*

If Solomon wrote these, I am wondering if he wrote these about himself. The question is not whether he wrote them before or after committing adultery to the Lord, because these verses have been included in the Bible, so they are true. But my question is whether this applies to every king, because not every king works together with God to bring down rebellious kings.
But if a king or president is good, or even if he is good in a certain period only, such as Winston Churchill, or at a specific decision only, fear him during that period or decision, but fear God always.

***Further sayings of the wise***
*These also are sayings of the wise:*
*To show partiality in judging is not good: Whoever says to the guilty, “You are innocent,” will be cursed by peoples and denounced by nations.*
*But it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come on them.*
*Proverbs 24:23‭-‬25 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.24.23-25.NIV*

In a sense, judges who do good work are richly blessed, while those who are corrupt will be cursed.
Now the question is whether this curse is from people or from God, because being cursed and denounced by people of course is not a good thing, but it is not the worst thing either. But if God curses you, then that is the worst thing that can happen to you here in this world.

*An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.*
 
 
What is a kiss on the lips? What is rewarding about that? A kiss is something soft, it cannot hurt, and on the lips means that it is soft on soft. An honest answer is just like that. It should arrive softly, if you are soft as well. If you are hard, then the one telling will have problem and you will too. It would be like kissing a rock. The rock would not feel anything and the kisser's lips would be scathed.
The analogy is imperfect in the sense that it usually the person who hears the answer will get hurt by an honest answer. But the fact remains that no one would like to kiss rocks, it does not help either side.
Be soft in your heart, therefore, and you will hear and accept more of the truth.
 
 
*Put your outdoor work in order and get your fields ready; after that, build your house.*
 
 

This is some advise that I should have followed about three years sooner. Then again, I might not have taken this seriously if I had not experienced it myself. I should have gotten my fields, my career, savings and other stuff ready, before buying the house I currently live in.
I know it is a miracle we saw a big house for a good price, having been online for a long time already, while the seller was a Christian and almost had the same surname as we did. It was wide instead of long and it needed total renovation, which was exactly what I wanted. But still, rejecting it because we did not have enough savings would not have been bad either.
 
 
*Do not testify against your neighbor without cause— would you use your lips to mislead? Do not say, “Iʼll do to them as they have done to me; Iʼll pay them back for what they did.”*
*Proverbs 24:26‭-‬29 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.24.26-29.NIV*

It is quite a coincidence to see this verse after hearing yesterday how someone has misled my uncle in believing I talked negatively about him. Why would a person, a church fellow nonetheless, testify against me, what have I done wrong?
The second verse would apply to me. I should not do back to them as they did to me. Though I am thinking that I would not do any of this, God knows me better than I know myself. I probably would do it, and therefore I have received this verse today. Though I still do not know what I would do, I would not gossip back about the other person or attack the person directly – at least, that is what I think – but I would probably hurt the other person in another way.
Thanks to the Lord for preventing my sin.

*30 I went past the field of a sluggard,*
*past the vineyard of someone who has no sense;*
*31 thorns had come up everywhere,*
*the ground was covered with weeds,*
*and the stone wall was in ruins.*
*32 I applied my heart to what I observed*
*and learned a lesson from what I saw:*
*33 A little sleep, a little slumber,*
*a little folding of the hands to rest—*
*34 and poverty will come on you like a thief*
*and scarcity like an armed man.*
 
*Proverbs 24:30-34 (NIV)*

The lessons learned are very valuable, for they occur in real life as frequent as anything else. This is not about farmers only, it is applicable to everyone in every situation.
The thorns the come up can be compared with the thorns Jesus used in the parable of the sower (or four types of ground). The thorns were the worldly temptation and seductions that killed the small plant.
So even if the seed, that is the seed within you, has rooted, this does not mean you are saved. You need to stay awake, or thorns will grow up and choke you.
The stone walls in ruins probably are not referring to the walls of Jerusalem, but if I do make that comparison, it is because of the lack of diligence in following and obeying the Lord of Israel that the walls were eventually broken by the Babylonians. Though – in my opinion – the Babylonians did not come like thieves, for the Lord had warned them many times through the prophets, it still came unexpected. Not because had not been warned, but because they were clueless.
