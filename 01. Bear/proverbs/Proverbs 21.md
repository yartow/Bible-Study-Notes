# Proverbs 21
*In the Lord ʼs hand the kingʼs heart is a stream of water that he channels toward all who please him.*
 
 
We think a king or rules has all power and can abuse us as he wishes, but God has all power over him. God can let the king take any decision that He wants, whenever He wants.
We just do not always see it and perhaps the king does not even know it himself. The king might even think it is his own will and we might see it as a bad act of the king. But we only need to know that God is in control. The king nor the devil will do anything that is outside of the scope that God allows.
 
 
*A person may think their own ways are right, but the Lord weighs the heart.*
 
 
Indeed, I should not think that my way is right because my ways are influenced by my heart. What I want I will think is right. But God can weight my heart and filter that out of the equation. God's ways are perfect, and if they are influenced by God's heart that is even better, for His will is perfect.
 
 
*To do what is right and just is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.*
 
 
Do what is right and just. Do not cheat, do not steal. Give people what they need and deserve, and the Lord will accept you and your gift.
 
 
*Haughty eyes and a proud heart— the unplowed field of the wicked—produce sin.*
*Proverbs 21:1‭-‬4 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.21.1-4.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.21.1-4.NIV)*
 
 
The character of the wicked is like an unplowed field of nothing can grow on it except for bushes and thistles and weed, unless something changes within this person, mainly his heart and eyes.

*The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty.*
 
 
*Work hard* is a constant encouragement in the Bible, for those who work hard will be rewarded. And those who do not, who make their money through thievery and wickedness, will lose all they have or drown in their money and stay unhappy, not find peace and joy. 
Sometimes, in the case of the rich man and Lazarus, this occurs after life, but still the reward is for the diligent and not the wicked.
 
 
*A fortune made by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare.*
 
 
As said above it is now confirmed in this verse. The fortune these people have made is like vapor, it is built on nothing and can be destroyed in a whim.
Moreover it is a deadly snare, a trap, for they will start trusting in it, using it as a foundation, not knowing it is like quicksand and everything they have built on his foundation will sink with it.

Note that the second part of this verse can also mean *a vapor for those who seek death*. A fortune can be a great way to help out people and use it as an inheritance for next generations. But those who seek death will not be able to enjoy this fortune, either because they die or because it will be gone. 

*The violence of the wicked will drag them away, for they refuse to do what is right.*
 
 
The wicked have another bad point and that is their violence. So except for lying, thieving and depending on money, they love violence. This violence may incur fear in the beginning which gives them some sort of power over people. But eventually it will cause them harm, because they will think that violence solves everything. Whenever they themselves do not understand something in class, they think it can be solved by hitting their teacher, for example.
In this way they will never learn the right way nor any other way except their own.
 
 
*The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the innocent is upright.*
*Proverbs 21:5‭-‬8 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.21.5-8.NIV*

There are two things that stay in mind when I read this. The first thing is that the the way of the guilty is devious, which means that it is meandering, going left and right, like a river, without any purpose.
This is how it is in real life. When I walk on the way of the guilty it will take me much longer to get where I need to be. I will be going left where I need to go right and the other way around. I will do things if which I will think in hindsight why I did that.
Why did I care so much about what others thought of me when I was younger, for example, or why was I so focused on making a career and have status?
The second thing it tells me is that this road is only going forward. I might be going to a different position, but I am still on the same level.
The conduct of the innocent is different, however. When I walk that path I will go *upwards*. When I am upright I will take the shortest path of getting into contact with God and I will actually get somewhere in an effective way. 
It is for this reason that the Bible also says in 1 Peter 5 that "*these qualities [...] will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."*

*Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.*

It is tempting to write something negative about my own wife here, but it is not the intention of the writer for us to do so. For what wisdom is there in living on the corner of a roof?
It is the writer's intention and purpose here to provide the (young) reader with healthy advise and wisdom. He is telling the reader not to marry a person who is quarrelsome. No matter how attractive the other person is, whether a man or a woman – though usually it is women who quarrel – this trait of quarreling must be gone before marrying.
For the person who already is married it means that he needs to work on helping his wife heal from this. And it might be that he is the reason for quarreling.

*The wicked crave evil; their neighbors get no mercy from them.*
 
 
When someone is evil their neighbors are going to suffer. The influence of the Satan is so strong that standing next to a wicked person will either bother you or drag you into it.
It says that the wicked *crave* evil. They even long for it. How bad can that be? 
I am not talking about someone having satanic rituals in their home and bothering you by doing it too loud, or even being bothered by the demonic spirits that will entertain your house as well, if you are literally his neighbor. I am talking about your fellowmen, your colleagues and everyone you regularly see.
If those people crave evil they will become a sting in your eye or flesh. And it is then that you will be taunted. They will start saying things to hurt you. They will ridicule your faith, abuse your good will, set up traps for you and try to ensnare you into their plans.
They will not stop bothering you, not as long as they are craving evil. They will not show you any mercy.
Why does the Bible call it mercy? Mercy means to not give someone something he does deserve,such as a punishment. The wicked do not withhold their taunting. Do we deserve to be taunted like that? The answer is simple. Yes.
For we were in the same position as they are. We let ourselves be open to sin so that the devil could enter our lives. We deserve to be transformed by the Satan and crave for evil, but it is God Who delivered us from this through his grace. He gave us His mercy by *not* handing us over to the Satan, though we deserved it, and His grace by *do* delivering us from becoming like the wicked, though we did not deserve it. 
 
 
*When a mocker is punished, the simple gain wisdom; by paying attention to the wise they get knowledge.*
*Proverbs 21:9‭-‬11 NIV*
[http://bible.com/111/pro.21.9-11.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.21.9-11.NIV)

The simple are those that are not good at learning. They might not be able to comprehend texts on laws and wisdom. The best way for them is to show. One way of this is by punishing mockers. In this way they will know what the consequences is of mocking (God's Law).
As an addition by looking at the wise, they get knowledge. By imitating what wise people do, they will understand what is good and what is not.
It is therefore of importance (e.g. in a church) that there are plenty of practical examples, because there will always be simple people in a church. And for those (and not only those) there must be wise people teaching them the way through their way of living.

*The Righteous One takes note of the house of the wicked*
*and brings the wicked to ruin.*
 
 
There are two things that God does. He knows and He acts.
The Righteous One, which is God Almighty Himself, *knows* which house is wicked. It cannot be hidden from Him.
He will also bring the wicked to ruin.
The unbelievers, on the other hand, think that God does neither of these things. They either think God does not know what they are doing – or they do not believe in God at all – or they think God will not punish them or that they can outsmart God.
Oh how foolish can a person be? And how much worse can one become by being aside from wicked also be foolish?
 
 
*Whoever shuts their ears to the cry of the poor*
*will also cry out and not be answered.*
 
 
We may realize we cannot help every poor person with money and we do not have enough time to give attention to each one of them either, but our hearts should not be hardened so as not being able to hear their cries, whether justified or not.
These poor people are indeed sometimes asking for attention only and not really in need while others want money to buy drugs or alcohol. Even then they are crying, be it not with their mouth but with their white self.
We cannot see however in a glimpse when we are walking by them whether they are in a real need or in a subconscious one, but we are not supposed to judge either. What we should do is not shutting our ears, listening will then come by itself.
If we do not shut our ears for the poor, I believe we will not shut our ears for the Holy Spirit either. P
 
 
*A gift given in secret soothes anger,*
*and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath.*

Giving someone a gift is not always a good idea. If you give it in our public, people might get the wrong idea. This verse is therefore emphasizing that a gift give *in* *secret* soothes anger. 
This person might not be willing or able to forgive you in public, because he has a reputation to keep. He might be afraid that others either perceive him as weak, for forgiving you, or corrupt, for taking bribes. But if it is done in secret, he knows you are not doing it for you reputation and he will better understand your intention.

*When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers.*
 
 
Justice is what evildoers are most afraid you. because they know they will not be the ones to receive it. Rather, they will the ones to pay for it.
There are criminals and white color criminals. Perhaps it is the whit collar criminals who are most afraid of justice, because they always thought they could get away with their crimes, but now not only are they being punished for it, their shame is also made public.
Real criminals already know they are guilty, their family and friends know about it. It is the life they have chosen and they are merely waiting for justice to arrive.
 
 
*Whoever strays from the path of prudence comes to rest in the company of the dead.*

 
 
We only need to stray from your path of prudence and we are already in the territory of the Satan. There is but a thin line between your way and that of the world, I would even say this line is infinitely thin, because there is no way that fulfills our desires (or in that case, that of the world) and that of Yours, there is no grey area. It is only because You have conformed our desires to Yours that we now want to walk of the path of prudence.
Your path is like the edge of a razor, no person could walk on it and stay on it, because it is so thin and the area next to it is infinitely larger than the edge itself. Falling of means never getting on the edge again.
It is only because of your grace that it is as if this edge is now somewhat wider, and it is because of Your Son's blood that every step we take outside of this edge is forgiven and paid for.
 
 
*Whoever loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and olive oil will never be rich.*
*Eccles. 21:15‭-‬17 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.21.15-17.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.21.15-17.NIV)*

The emphasis is on the word "love" here. As human beings we love pleasure, but we must not let it rule our lives. As a matter of fact, we must love discipline and obedience to You so much, that pleasure in comparison becomes a hateful thing, just like Jesus talked about hating our relatives and friends.
But the core of this is that enjoyment should not our main purpose. If being rich is our purpose, this means that wine and olive oil are not means towards this goal. If serving God is our purpose, then enjoyment is not what we must look for.

*The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, and the unfaithful for the upright.*
 
 
I am not sure about what this means, but perhaps it is saying that if we are imprisoned and someone has to be ransomed in order to set us free, it would be the wicked and the unfaithful. God would prefer them to be jailed for a longer period.
 
 
*Better to live in a desert than with a quarrelsome and nagging wife.*
 
 
Previously this verse was put somewhat differently, saying it was better to live in a corner on the rooftop. Now, however, we get to an even worse condition, a hotter and more isolated place, with less water available and more distant from anything else.
Would even that be better than a nagging wife? Remember that in the previous verse it said "a quarrelsome wife" not a nagging one. Perhaps a nagging wife is worse than a quarrelsome wife.
You might think that having availability to to some comfort would be better than having none, right? If only living with someone irritating.
Unfortunately the situation is a bit more complex. It is not just someone you are living with. It is your other half, your spouse, the one you promised to share your life with.
In both comparisons the choice is between quiet and rest, and not having that, and the author is saying that one should always choose quiet and rest. And I think he is mostly speaking to men here.
 
 
*The wise store up choice food and olive oil, but fools gulp theirs down.*
 
 
If olive oil is a luxury, I better understand this verse. Choice food should be saved for special occasions.
Just like with money, it should not be spent all at once. Only fools do that.
 
 
*Whoever pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity and honor.*
 
 
Whatever it is you are looking for, make sure it has to do with righteousness and love. Because only then you will the things that are most important. On earth that would be life, prosperity and honor, but on heaven it would be eternal life in the presence of God.
 
 
*One who is wise can go up against the city of the mighty and pull down the stronghold in which they trust.*
*Proverbs 21:18‭-‬22 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.21.18-22.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.21.18-22.NIV)*

*One who is wise can go up against the city of the mighty and pull down the stronghold in which they trust.*

The power of wisdom goes far beyond what we can see with our eyes. As we have seen Odysseus' power when he tricked the Trojans and brought down their city using his wisdom and the power of the army, but it was his wisdom that came first.
So in this present age our wisdom has to first if we want to win wars. Our wars are not purposed to bring down real cities, but it is to bring down the kingdom of the Satan. Its walls can be breached with our prayers and through the gospel we can set captives free. It is the army of God, His angels and His power through which everything rises or falls, but it is irrelevant wisdom first of all to realize where we should get this power. Of course this wisdom is obtained from God as well, so it all begins with him.
For...
*Everything got started in Him and finds its purpose in Him.*
Colossians 1:16 (MSG)

*Those who guard their mouths and their tongues keep themselves from calamity.*

Most calamities, if not all, start with people not being able to shut their mouths. Even if it is not speaking it is someone who decided to be disobedient. See for example the boy in that movie with Patrick Bateman (the one who played Batman in the Dark Knight) where he signaled bombers (it could be the wrong movie I'm referring to) or Designated Survivor, the series with Kiefer Sutherland, where the head of the army strikes an attack without obeying the president and potentially risking a war.
But keep your mouth shut at the right times and you may prevent a fight.

Lord, please help me to keep my mouth shut and to withhold my actions until You have approved them. Help me to control myself and be patient. Especially in the discuss that might arise when Sandra and I will leave this congregation. Let us, especially at that moment, know that it is to serve you in a better way.

*The proud and arrogant person—“Mocker” is his name— behaves with insolent fury.*
 
 
I have had these periods where I was enraged . Take for example this inexpensive time that I was really looking forward to a neighborhood dinner in our cafetaria, and some guy was trying to put up a fight. I saw it as soon as I arrived, I stepped in and in my pride I thought I could stop the fight by kicking him out and making him afraid of me.
I got pushed myself and only made things worse.

A perfect example combining pride, arrogance and fury.
However, I do not see where the mocking comes into place.
I suddenly realize now, this person, or in other words, me, is not mocking others, but he is mocking God. He is thinking he can solve things himself and he thinks that he can solve it with violence.
And not only is he not listening to God, he is even trespassing the Law because he is stirring up fights, causing a rupture between people.
 
 
*The craving of a sluggard will be the death of him, because his hands refuse to work.*
 
 
Notice that it does not say that his sluggishness will kill him, but his craving will. Eventually his craving would require food, which his hands are not providing him.
You cannot be both lazy and wanting a lot. That will mean the end of you. This is what I see in he attitude of young and uneducated people. They want the job that makes the most money for the least work. They care not about whether they find enjoyment in it or whether they can learn and grow. If it is growth, it is for the money.
This is a an abuse, I would say, for not using something God has given you – to me – is abuse. An abuse of two things God has given us.
God has given us a purpose to enjoy life. He has given us senses to smell and taste. The purpose of these senses is not only to see and hear. The purpose is also to enjoy music and social contacts and so much more. That is the first thing.
The second thing is our purpose to serve Him. If we do not want to use our talents, which are meant to serve God and others, let alone grow and multiply our talents, we are in fact saying that we do not want to serve Him.
Now these two things go together. We have a talent, such as singing or playing football, and we enjoy doing it as well. I think there is no exception to that. Some people have negative experiences and were pressured to perform their talent and therefore stopped performing. But deep down they still like it, because it is what they are good at.
 
 
*All day long he craves for more, but the righteous give without sparing.*
*Proverbs 21:22‭-‬26 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.21.22-26.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.21.22-26.NIV)*
 
 
It is quite noticeable that this is the only part I have seen so far in Proverbs that consists of two verses. In a certain way it explains the first verse.
As mentioned before the sluggard craves and that is his death.
I would say that the craving is an indication of what the body needs. If a person craves for food, it is because he is hungry.
He craves for more means that he has already received. Apparently he did not have enough. Not enough to keep his own body alive, let alone give to others.
But the righteous not only have enough to stay alive (even though this is not explicitly stated here) but they have enough to give away and not only, but give without sparing.
How much would we not get from if we were not craving so much for ourselves? We would get riches in abundance, more than we can imagine and needs that are so little.

*The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable— how much more so when brought with evil intent!*
 
 
The Lord is saying that if you are wicked, you do not need to bring a sacrifice, even if you bring it with good intentions. For of what use is it to be praised by wicked people. That would only blemish God's reputation.
I do not even need to speak of the wicked when they have bad intentions. Only the wicked themselves would accept such a sacrifice, to gain honor for themselves and the materials of the sacrifice.
So remember that if you want to do something for God, being good to others is of more worth than a deed for God.
 
 
*A false witness will perish, but a careful listener will testify successfully.*
 
 
In a perfect world false witnesses will always be caught and punished, but unfortunately that is not true in the real world. Fortunately we may know that God does have a perfect world coming up, and in this world, not far away in the future, these false witnesses are gnashing their teeth.
What is meant with perish, however, pertains to this world. Perishing is not yet dying, but definitely is going towards that direction. I cannot imagine how a false witness can have a clear conscience, knowing that an innocent man is imprisoned or executed because of his testimony.
What does a careful listener have to do with testifying successfully? I think the answer lies in giving people what they want to hear. You cannot do that if you do not listen to them first.
If I am going to leave this congregation, and I need to give my reasons, this argument is some sort of testimony. It is a testimony of what I have seen happen here and what I have not seen happen. It shows how I have felt over the years.

*The wicked put up a bold front, but the upright give thought to their ways.*
 
 
Yesterday I was one of the wicked. In my thoughts I had fantasized about beating up an irritating train passenger. I put up a bold front and the only thing withholding me was God. Without him I would have done a foolish thing.
The upright on the other hand would have given thought to their ways. I, however, have given too much thought to it, to my ways that is, not to God's ways.

*There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the Lord .*
 
 
So many people have tried to reason with God, not knowing He is the One Who invented reason. They fight with God even though God is the god all strategies, the Master planner. No one can succeed, because God Himself is the very definition of success. All that people are striving for
 
 
*The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory rests with the Lord .*
*Proverbs 21:27‭-‬31 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.21.27-31.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.21.27-31.NIV)*
 
 
I can do everything to be prepared for the next war, which is coming real soon, but nothing I *do* can assure my victory, not even my prayers. The Lord is the One Who decides upon the war and proclaims the victor. 
One thing that is true though is that the Lord's side will always win. So You can assure your victory not by what you do, but by *where* you are and Who you are following.
