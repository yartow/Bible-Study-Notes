# Proverbs 29
*Whoever remains stiff-necked after many rebukes will suddenly be destroyed—without remedy.*
 
 
For me the keyword here is *suddenly*. Does God not give a warning then? He has already, in His many rebukes. 
We people see bad things in life as curses, but quite often they are rebukes for what we have done wrong. Instead of repenting then to the Lord, we curse and blame God for what He has done to us.
That is why these people, including us, before we were saved, will suddenly be destroyed, *without* remedy. 
A remedy is for those who might be saved, but for those who cannot be saved anymore, the remedy is useless, for they will fall in the same pattern over and over.
 
 
*When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice; when the wicked rule, the people groan.*
 
 
Like in the previous proverb it is clear that the people will suffer from whoever is ruling the country.
What is noticeable is that the righteous do not even have to be rulers, they only need to thrive and the people will notice the effect they have.
The effect of a God and the church in the city will be quite noticeable when it is not there anymore. The number of single parents and mixed family will significantly increase.
 
 
*A man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father, but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth.*
 
 
It seems like the man spoken of in this verse is one and the same in both verses. What I mean is, a man may have wisdom, but still be sinful even to the brink of going to prostitutes.
It feels like this verse is meant for me. My father thinks I am wise and in that way I bring joy to him. But he does not know about my sexual sins. It would bring him great sadness if he knew about that.
Perhaps it is not a companion of prostitutes that has squandered my material wealth, but it is sex that squandered my spiritual wealth, for without it my life and purity would have been so much different.
 
 
*By justice a king gives a country stability, but those who are greedy for bribes tear it down.*
 
 
Justice is indeed something that no one likes, because everyone is unjust. Who likes to get a ticket for speeding? Yet it is needed for stability. And those who want to get rich tear it down.
Drugsdealers for example hamper justice by bribing judges and policemen, so they can make more money. But judges and policemen are greedy as well and are tearing justice down by accepting the bribes.
Know on which side you are. There is no neutral side.
 
 
*Those who flatter their neighbors are spreading nets for their feet.*

Flattery refers to something bad here. Not a good way of complimenting is meant, but a way of talking in order to get something, such as to be liked.
But it is a trap for oneself.
I can imagine that one pretends to be nice, all the time, while in fact he is not. And if the neighbor finds out, the consequences are much worse than if he had not flattered. The neighbor will feel he has been cheated all the time and be filled with scorn.
 
 
**Evildoers are snared by their own sin, but the righteous shout for joy and are glad.**

 
 
I have in my mind always these thoughts of planning things, like a perfect murder or a theft, to get away with things like that. I am not sure if this from a point of playing detective or whether I really am capable of doing such a thing if I could think of a flawless plan.
In the latter case, I must be aware that I am not snared by my own sin. For the thoughts and plans I have, might be done to me by someone else.
The righteous on the other hand would not think about such things. They would shout for joy and be glad. They would not be thinking about how to become rich or how to deal with something or someone, but leave it to God and be glad for what they have right now.
 
 
*The righteous care about justice for the poor, but the wicked have no such concern.*
 
 
Not everyone who thinks about justice for the poor is righteous, but those who do not are most certainly not righteous.
Even those who care about the poor are not necessarily thinking about justice.
It is not only protecting the poor against thievery, trafficking and abuse, and incriminating the wicked, it is also making sure they do not end up there.
Why is it that the poor people in the States, but everywhere else as well, often end up as criminals, even if they have not come in contact before with criminals? It is because their evil desires are ruling over them and there is no knowledge about how to flee from this desire and how to use God's strength for that, for with their own it is (obviously) not possible.

So true justice would mean not only protecting the poor from evildoing by others, but giving them a chance to obtain the knowledge to become righteous themselves. The only is to expose them to God's love and teachings.  
 
 
 
*Mockers stir up a city, but the wise turn away anger.*
 
 
I am not really sure what mocking has to do with rebellion, but I do know that the unwise people are always drawing attention in a wrong way.
The Turkish population here in the Netherlands were causing a riot in Rotterdam just a few weeks ago because the Turkish prime minister was not allowed to land here because he wanted to campaign for the Turkish party during the votes.
The Turkish people already have a bad reputation because of high criminality rates and their rates general behavior towards people. This riot confirmed the Dutch people's perception of them.
Whether they were mocking the Netherlands? Perhaps, because we – in a sense – allowed this, but most certainly they, and their associated religion, will not be seen as wise.
The wise should turn away anger instead, and though ridiculed, like Christians are, in situations like these they will be deemed to be wise.
 
 
*If a wise person goes to court with a fool, the fool rages and scoffs, and there is no peace.*
 
*Proverbs 29:1‭-‬9 NIV*

It seems like this verse, but also other verses, are indicating believers should not go to court, or not go to court easily. It is ashaming, facts in the hidden will be out in the open. Going to court with a fool goes even one step further towards disaster, he might spill even unnecessary things that are not relevant.
It makes me realize what a "fool" I was. Not a fool in the sense of this verse, but to think I could debate and argue with reason with fools. Fools do not listen to reason, they only think that what they do is right. That is why going to court with them will not help, for court is based on reason.

*The bloodthirsty hate a person of integrity and seek to kill the upright.*
 
 
There are those who really are bloodthirsty. They kill not because of hatred or revenge, but because it is in their nature, or has become part of it. I know this guy who probably was not raised very well—his parents smoked and so did he at a very young age. He sort of bullied me, while I had done nothing to him, nor did I have anything for him to be jealous of.
Perhaps I was a person of integrity or I was upright, but in a sense he hated me. The proverb gives no reason and that is exactly what the bloodthirsty have, *no reason*. 
This too, I need to learn and understand when "reasoning" with others, to know that they have no reason—not logic, as in the previous verse, but a cause—for their actions.
 
 
*Fools give full vent to their rage, but the wise bring calm in the end.*
 
 
All of us are enraged sometimes, but some of us try to constrain it. Even in the most furious situations normal people would still have some consciousness about the consequences of letting themselves fully go. Fools do not. They give full vent to their rage.
The wise—on the other hand—not only bring themselves to calm, but others as well. Let us strive for wisdom.
 
 
*If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials become wicked.*
 
 
Officials are led by their ruler and in a sense have chosen their ruler as well, for they could have chosen to have a normal function, becoming a layman or being in the rebellion as well.
As leaders we are responsible for our officials as well and therefore we need to be careful of what we see, read and hear. For if we feed ourselves with lies, these will spread all over our homes. In a family situation, both the wife and the children would believe these lies.
I have seen it happen in several families, when the father was convinced of a certain "truth", he convinced his wife as well.
 
 
*The poor and the oppressor have this in common: The Lord gives sight to the eyes of both.*

The Lord leads all kind of people to Himself. We would expect that the poor only would convert, in hope of a better life or a reason for suffering, but the rich convert as well.
I cannot think of many, because indeed, the number is less, and those I know who are rich, were not rich before they converted.
But whatever the case, whether the poor or the oppressor, Jesus gives both the same chance to see Him and the world how He sees it. And then He gives both the chance to convert from their sins.
 
 
*If a king judges the poor with fairness, his throne will be established forever.*
 
 
A king's throne can be forgotten real easy. It was not long ago when our current king's grandmother was reigning in the Netherlands, about 40 years ago, yet only old people ever mention her and remember her.
Not that she was a bad queen, but even when she was a good one, the term "forever" is family relative.
Not so with God's promise. When God promises something, He will hold His promise.
I believe that when a king is truly good to the poor people, he will be remembered by many generations.
In my opinion, both the two queens as well as the current king did not do a good job in taking care of the king.
 
 
*A rod and a reprimand impart wisdom, but a child left undisciplined disgraces its mother.*
 
 
Somewhere in Proverbs a verse like this occurs as well, though the disgracing was of the father.
In eastern cultures it is usually the father who is disgraced because he is the head of the family, but the mother equally suffers, because she is the one spending most of her time with the children.
Therefore if a child is undisciplined, people will know that the father does not have his household under control, but also know that the mother has not disciplined her children well.
It is good that the Bible puts responsibility on both parents.
 
 
*When the wicked thrive, so does sin, but the righteous will see their downfall.*
 
 
The wicked are present in every country and in almost every history I hear about them, they thrive upon sin. Sin is the best way to make money and therefore even if we are not attracted to sin, through money we do.
But the righteous, usually those not dwelling in money and sin, will see what happens to the wicked, because they outlive them. The lives of the wicked are short. Pablo Escobar and other drug dealers do not live long; Fidel Castro, though not a drug dealer, is an exception, but God has His plans for him.
 
 
*Discipline your children, and they will give you peace; they will bring you the delights you desire.*
 
 
Children are a person's greatest treasure, even when they do not realize. Movies such as that one in which Nick Nolte stars as an alcoholic, show that deep inside every person cares about his children and wants to have contact with them as soon as they are sober. Some of us are drunk on alcohol, others on welfare and materialism.
Why are children your delight? Not because they take care of you when you are older, but because in them is a piece of you. We have partly created then from our own DNA—though of course it is God Who does the real creating. And this too is a good thing part of being created in the image of God, we have created in our image when we have children.
But your children can give you delight or they can give you unrest, depending on how they have become and the depends in how you have disciplined them.
 
 
*Where there is no revelation, people cast off restraint; but blessed is the one who heeds wisdomʼs instruction.*
*Proverbs 29:10‭-‬18 NIV*
[http://bible.com/111/pro.29.10-18.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.29.10-18.NIV)

Everyone needs revelation from God, people do not know God nor what He wants. The people will only care about being free, that is being free in their own eyes. That is why this verse says "cast off restraint", because they think they are being restrained by God, while it is God Who is giving us and them the freedom to move within His boundaries.
For those who heed His wisdom, He will bless them, and perhaps illogical, but they will not be any more safe according to this world's standards, but they will be according to the standards of heaven.

*Proverbs 29:19 (NIV) 19 Servants cannot be corrected by mere words;*
*though they understand, they will not respond.*
 

As servants of God and formerly slaves of the Satan we know how difficult it is to obey our master. It is difficult to obey God when He commands us not to do something bad, and it is difficult to obey the Satan when he tells us to do something, while we inwardly know it is wrong.
The Satan forces us to do something by giving us no other choice, God has to bend us by showing the consequence and giving the penalty for disobedience.
 
 
*Proverbs 29:20 (NIV) 20 Do you see someone who speaks in haste?*
*There is more hope for a fool than for them.*

When we speak in haste we will say things that are not correct or spoken in the wrong tone.
A fool may be recognized as one and his words will therefore be partly ignored, but one who is sensible and speaks bad things, this person will face the full consequence of his words.

*A servant pampered from youth will turn out to be insolent.*

 
 
Servants, like us, need to be thoroughly trained. Like wild horses we are, untamed and disobedient. Later on in life it is much harder to take this horse, but early in life they can be managed.
And so we must manage our children from a young age, and we must let ourselves be managed from a young age by mature believers.

Of course when it concerns servants, as is the original meaning of this text, it is best to train them from a young age on, so they know what to expect from their master. Likewise, this can be applied to us.

An angry person stirs up conflict, and a hot-tempered person commits many sins.

Anger itself is not wrong, but hottemperedness is. Hot-temperedness almost always causes many sins, because the timing is usually if not always wrong, but anger can be good at times.
When is it wrong to be angry then? When does anger stir up conflict? When one goes the line and builds up too much anger.
An angry person can therefore have two causes, he either became angry in a discussion by building up anger or he already was angry from a previous event.
Either way he should work out his anger during the discussion or not take it with him to the next one.

*Pride brings a person low, but the lowly in spirit gain honor.*

 
 
As with many of the stories from the Bible, not the way of the world will happen, but God's way. Not the oldest will rule, but the youngest, and not the prideful and those of stature, but the meek and gentle ones, those who are lowly in spirit.
It is those who deserve most of the honor, regardless of their accomplishments, should we not then as one body give them what they deserve?
Let us say that there is a person in your church who worked very hard to get his degree in theology, and works hard as well in church as a pastor and preacher. Now let us says there is another person who is not that well educated and does his best to learn how everything in the church building works. He knows how the coffee machine works, the electric systems, he fixes things when they are broken, he offers his own free time for the church.
Which person deserves most honor? Is this pastor not honored already by the congregation, by receiving a salary, a stand almost every week, recognition and people who talk with him?
The other person is less or not honored but in effort works just as hard. Between the two, who deserves to be honored?

*The accomplices of thieves are their own enemies; they are put under oath and dare not testify.*
 
 
This is an advise for everyone not to help thieves. If you do help them and are caught, you will be put on trial under oath, thus you cannot lie, if you do not testify you will be persecuted for perjury, if you do testify the thief will come for you and take revenge.
You will only ensnare yourself if you let yourself in with such people.
 
 
*Fear of man will prove to be a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is kept safe.*
 
 
Like in the verse before, the person only brings himself into trouble if he fears man. Fearing justice for being put in trial, and fearing criminals for being attacked. Neither way is good.
The only good way is to fear God and God alone, because when He keeps you safe, no man can hurt you.

*Many seek an audience with a ruler, but it is from the Lord that one gets justice.*
 
 
In many ways we people are trying to get help. We try to fix it ourselves first, and then try with others. Sometimes we try with official offices to get justice, but it is always at the Lord's feet that obtain it.

*The righteous detest the dishonest; the wicked detest the upright.*
Proverbs 29:19‭-‬27 NIV

[http://bible.com/111/pro.29.19-27.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.29.19-27.NIV)

There is a natural hate between the dishonest and the righteous. This is not because the dishonest cannot stand the righteous. For who could not stand someone doing good? What is wrong with a person helping his innocent fellowman?
When someone detests such a person, it just means that he himself has had a bad experience with it. Perhaps he has seen hypocrites before, acting like the righteous. Or has has not been helped by one when he desperately needed one.
As for the righteous detesting the dishonest, except for it being a sin, and naturally we would hate sin as reborn Christians—but instead hate the person—perhaps we hate them because we ourselves were once dishonest as well and we hate to see ourselves in such a situation.
Love is the answer to all things.
