# Proverbs 27
*Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.* 

Though we may be glad for every day that is coming, for every day gives us another opportunity to praise God and give glory to Him, and perhaps even bring someone to Christ, by His grace, we do not know what will happen.
Boasting is therefore out of the place for it is pure pride to say what plans we have tomorrow without realizing it is by God's grace that we are alive.

*Let someone else praise you, and not your own mouth; an outsider, and not your own lips.*

Here, boasting is mentioned again. If someone else does it, it is called praise, but if we do it ourselves, it is called boasting.
The whole Christian principle is to do these good things to others, and not too much to ourselves. Love others, not yourself (too much). Compliment others, not yourself.
In this way we can compliment and praise each other continually without being at fault. But if we all start complimenting ourselves, then this society will be awful to live in.

*Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but a foolʼs provocation is heavier than both.* 

When someone provoked me and accused me of certain things, I did not have the right to go at him and rebuke him, because is not my brother in Christ.
I might chase him away from the Lord had I done so.
This caused a heavy burden on me. How do I tell him, someone who is so sensitive, without him lashing back at me? How do I do that with love, if I do not love him that much?
That was a heavy period. Love and self-control most probably are my weakest points. But through obedience of God I could overcome it and receive the love I need to give this person.
A fool I would not immediately call him, but foolish, yes indeed. For his accusations are foolish from the eyes of God.

*Anger is cruel and fury overwhelming, but who can stand before jealousy?* 

If I were angry or furious at someone, perhaps I could restrain myself through the power of God's Holy Spirit. But jealousy sneaks in. If I could restrain myself at a single burst of jealousy, it does not mean that I could continually do so. Especially when I am not aware of it.

*Better is open rebuke than hidden love.*
 
 
Many people do not understand that to be rebuked has a good message in it. Yes, not always is this done out of love, but quite often there is an element of care in it, wishing the best for another.
This seems like some kind of hidden love, like when a father punishes his children, it is done out of love. But why does this proverb then say that it is *better* than hidden love? That is probably because hidden love does not show anything while rebuking does.
In hindsight we can say that the time when our teacher or our parent rebuked us was meant to be good. But we cannot say in hindsight anything about hidden love and hidden activities if we do not know about it.
 
 
*Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses.*
 
 
Just like a a rebuke from a friend can be accepted or a slap in the face, which is better than the enemy's kiss, this verse is saying the same thing. It goes one notch further, however, by saying that an enemy not only gives kisses, but also multiplies them.
If an enemy wants to seduce you, he will not give you a small gift, for what is that worth to you? How will that compel you? No, he will give you what you cannot have or cannot pay for.
It is in this way how Muslims in Indonesia seduce Christians in poverty with houses and richness.
 
 
*One who is full loathes honey from the comb, but to the hungry even what is bitter tastes sweet.*
 
 
This is so applicable to me, for when I am have received so much blessings from the Lord, I cannot see the little blessings anymore and they start irritating me, because they are little.
I have had times a lot of things in my life were going well. I was a student, had money, a warm place to sleep, enough sleep and no worries. But one little thing I wanted to have and that was a girlfriend.
And so I felt sad, because I did not have what I wanted. And I could not see what I already had.
Perhaps I could see what I had, but I did not appreciate it as much as I do now.
Right now I am longing for enough sleep and rest after work. I am longing to be free of financial worries.

*Like a bird that flees its nest is anyone who flees from home.*
 
 
Fleeing from home is not negative perse, when the connotation of the negative aspect of fleeing is left out, but leaving home has its pros and cons.
The pros are having more liberty, and from it learning discipline and perseverance. Or learning from bad luck.
However, liberty also causes for a lot of barriers for sin to be removed. If one has the discipline to learn to become wiser, liberty is a good thing. But if one merely wants to be a libertine, then the negative connotation proves to be right.
 
 
*Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart, and the pleasantness of a friend springs from their heartfelt advice.*
 
 
I always get a warm feeling when a lady passes by me and, without even have looked at her, I smell her perfume. Sometimes it is because I remember the scent and it brings good memories, but usually that is not the case.
These scents do not give me this warm feeling when I smell them in the store, it is the combination of the personal scents from the skin combined with the perfume.
I believe that even two or three thousand years ago people were aware of these effects of perfume and were therefore very costly.

The same kind of joy occurs when meeting a friend, for it is good to be with him, *hiney matov.*
Even more so, as this proverb is saying, is the heartfelt advice. His advice may be good or not, but the fact that it comes out of his heart and knowing he really does it for my best interest, gives me a feeling of inner joy, because someone actually cares about me.
 
 
 
 
*Do not forsake your friend or a friend of your family, and do not go to your relativeʼs house when disaster strikes you— better a neighbor nearby than a relative far away.*
*Proverbs 27:1‭-‬10 NIV*
http://bible.com/111/pro.27.1-10.NIV

I do not have dozens of friends, even in university I only had a few I hung out with regularly. Those friends are now still called my best friends, but they live abroad and I hardly see them.
Just like my relatives in Hong Kong and Malaysia, I rarely see them. Instead it is my church family here who is ready to back me up, whenever I am ready to call upon them.

*Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart; then I can answer anyone who treats me with contempt.*
 
 
Sometimes all I need is joy from one thing. If I know that God is on my side, I care about nothing else. The problem is that I am not sure whether I am always on God's side because of my sins.
When my wife is on my side and respects and admires me, then I am satisfied as well. And anyone who treats me with contempt I can answer.
 
 
*The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.*
 
 
It is not good to always take things head on. If there is danger ahead and there is no reason to encounter it, I should avoid the danger.
 
 
*Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger; hold it in pledge if it is done for an outsider.*
 
 
Someone who cannot be trusted to take care of himself, should not be in charge of his own money. He is too reckless for something like that for her would trust a stranger with his money.
 
 
*If anyone loudly blesses their neighbor early in the morning, it will be taken as a curse.*
 
 
There are two ways of looking at this. The blesser could want others to hear his blessings for others and therefore insincerely lets others know he blessed this person. The other way is that it is too early in the morning and at such times people are not too eager to take blessings. I think this verse is referring to the situation in which a blessing is given.
Thus a blessing, no matter how well intended, can coke across as a curse if it is not done in the right way and at the right time.

I think I should be very careful with blessing people over there.
 
 
*A quarrelsome wife is like the dripping of a leaky roof in a rainstorm;*
*restraining her is like restraining the wind or grasping oil with the hand.*
 
 
This analogy with a quarrelsome wife has occurred two or three times before in Proverbs. This time it had an added "in a rainstorm" (I think), and also the second line is added to it.
A quarrelsome wife cannot be restrained. She is not quarreling because she is offended or angry, but because she is looking for quarrels. Whatever you give her to stop the quarrel, she will find something else to quarrel about.
What should be done about such a wife?
 
 
*As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.*
 
 
It is definitely necessary for me to be sharpened by other people, both Christian and non Christians. But this also goes for other people.
It is amazing to see how many people forget about this important proverb. They know the meaning of it, but they are forgetting to out it in practice. Especially the part about sharpening.
Sharpening hurts, the process of improving and looking more like God hurts, but it will make you sharper, in order to help you become more like God in your behavior and mindset.
 
 
*The one who guards a fig tree will eat its fruit, and whoever protects their master will be honored.*
 
 
You will get what you deserve. It is only logical that if you are loyal to your master, you will receive your fare share from him, if he is an honest man.
This principle extends to every field in life. Sometimes though, it could be the case where guarding a tree or a master may take years. Loyalty therefore requires patience and endurance.
We may know therefore that if we serve our master well, we will be honored.

*As water reflects the face, so oneʼs life reflects the heart.*

*Proverbs 27:11‭-‬19 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.27.11-19.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.27.11-19.NIV)*

I honestly do not dare say about myself that I achieved something great in life. Nor do I dare to say that I have lived a good life which shows my good heart.
No, unfortunately I am not even sure if my heart is and therefore if my life is good. I am afraid that all that remains of me are bad memories of my lust, my perversion and other sins such as arrogance and selfishness. This must come from a heart that contains all this evil.
For now, I am not convinced that I have lived my life the way God wants it to be. But God quite often gives second chances. I feel like I have one right now, to go to another church and do what I need to do for others outside of the church.

*Death and Destruction are never satisfied, and neither are human eyes.*
 
 
I can say from personal experience that this is true. The eyes of man, and especially those of men, are never satisfied. We may think our eyes are saturated and temporarily need no more views, but that is all, it is temporary.
Only shortly afterwards our eyes are accustomed to everything we see and we will be needing more.
 
 
*The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but people are tested by their praise.*
 
 
Does this mean that a person's quality can be tested by how much he praises others, or God? Or does the praise refer to the praise they receive from humans?
Of course a lot of bad people are receiving a lot of praise from their fans, but they are criticized as well, such as President Obama and Pablo Escobar. So the amount of praise does not indicate the value of a person, but rather it is a test.
Note that in this verse it is referring to the general case where usually when lots of people praise you, it means you have done something good.
Perhaps the test is is whether you give in to all this praise.
 
 
*Though you grind a fool in a mortar, grinding them like grain with a pestle, you will not remove their folly from them.*
 
 
For some it is impossible to have the foolishness removed out of them. It is at Celebrate Recovery that we learn we cannot and should not change others (for the good), except ourselves. Only God can change them and us, and when we change we can influence the lives of others.
 
 
*Be sure you know the condition of your flocks, give careful attention to your herds;*  
*for riches do not endure forever, and a crown is not secure for all generations.*
 
If your herd performs well – if you are a pastor – or your children – if you are a parent – will not always be like that. They change and they need to be constantly fed.
Do not take for granted what God has given you. 
 

*When the hay is removed and new growth appears and the grass from the hills is gathered in,*
*the lambs will provide you with clothing, and the goats with the price of a field.*
*You will have plenty of goatsʼ milk to feed your family and to nourish your female servants.*

*Proverbs 27:20‭-‬27 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.27.20-27.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.27.20-27.NIV)*

So not forgetting the above, if you take good care of your herd, you will get a good harvest from them which in turn feeds you to become a better pastor or parent.
This last part is quite remarkable, not only will you be fed enough, but you will get so much that you can even feed your family and your servants.
This is the the harvest you can expect if you are loyal to God.
