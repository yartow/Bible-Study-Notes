# Proverbs 19
*Better the poor whose walk is blameless than a fool whose lips are perverse.*
 
 
I see a strange comparison between the poor and a fool. In most study Bibles it says that the fool should be a rich fool. I do not think there has been a mistake in the omission of the word *rich*. Rather I think the discrepancy is even stronger when omitting this word. 
No one wants to be poor, if he can choose to be rich. But if richness comes with perverse lips and all the bad consequences, or fruit, as in the previous verses in the previous chapter, then most would choose poverty over richness. But what if there is only a blameless poor person and a not rich person with perverse lips, who would you then choose to be?
It is obvious that all would then choose to be the poor person, and with all I mean those with wisdom, for this proverb is written out of wisdom.

In the case of a new rich person, chapter 28, one can interpret at as follows.
We have concluded that every wise person would choose to be poor. Now we add to that that even adding a lot of money on the equation, it still does not change the outcome.
That is why it is said, wisdom is worth more than rubies and diamonds.
 
 
*Desire without knowledge is not good— how much more will hasty feet miss the way!*
 
 
I was wondering whether this combination of desire and the lack of knowledge is only wrong because haste can lead to mistakes. But it is not just that. In haste one may miss the way, indeed, but one can stop, go back and take the right way.
But if there is desire involved there is no stopping. People full of desire will rush through until they have reached the end.
Such is the case of people in love, without knowledge they will indulge in sex without thinking about the consequences, without thinking about relations that may be broken. Take for example a couple who unexpectedly gets pregnant, or the couple who decides to marry without the approval of their parents while patience and talking with their parents would have helped a lot.
Some things cannot be stopped anymore, so it is wise not to haste and if one does not have knowledge, not to desire, for the most important relation, with God Himself, may be broken as well.
 
 
*A person’s own folly leads to their ruin, yet their heart rages against the Lord .*
*Proverbs 19:1‭-‬3 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.19.1-3.NIV*

Even a person's own mistakes have causes his own ruin, he is angry with God for this. What has God done wrong here? Nothing. Why is this person angry with God? Because the heart can feel that God says *you should have listened to me*. The heart knows it is wrong but does not want it blame itself, because it made those decisions itself without listening to the warnings of God. 
The heart is not blaming God though. But still it is not drawn closer to God, because of something that is called insanity. It can be described as follows.
The heart says to itself: *Ok, I admit I was wrong and that I need help to do it better, but I'll go to anyone but God to find help.*
There is no rationale for this. He is just angry that God was right and he was not.

*Wealth attracts many friends, but even the closest friend of the poor person deserts them.*
 
 
For those who prayed for more wealth, it attracts many friends, and for those who decided to rather be poor as in a few verses above, even your closest friend will leave you.
So what is good about being poor then? The thing is that it is worse to be wealthy. In this interpretation I would say that it is not normal to attract friends. Wealth is like honey, they come for the honey, not for you. And when friends leave you when you are poor, that has got a good side, for at least you know they are not real friends.
 
 
*A false witness will not go unpunished, and whoever pours out lies will not go free.*

If it is king Solomon who is saying this, it means the country has justice. For a witness can cause a person to end up in jail or get the death penalty. He should not be punished with a mere fine or short jail time, especially when a person has been wrongly convicted.
 
 
*Many curry favor with a ruler, and everyone is the friend of one who gives gifts.*
*Proverbs 19:4‭-‬6 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.19.4-6.NIV*

I am not sure what *curry* means, but from the context I see it stands for *relating*. Rulers often give favors, that is why rulers are thought to give favor. 
In fact that is how it should be done. A ruler should receive taxes and give these away accordingly to those need it.

*The poor are shunned by all their relatives— how much more do their friends avoid them! Though the poor pursue them with pleading, they are nowhere to be found.*
 
 
This is one of the longer verses of the proverbs. I am not sure if the proverbs were numbered by the same people who numbered the rest of the Bible, but it seems that these two sentences belong together.
It is true that the poor are shunned by their family, even if these poor people are not poor because of their own fault.
The family usually does not want to take in a poor member of their family. In this situation I referring more to a cousin like family member, because that is right on the border of not knowing him well enough to be obliged to take him in (like a son) while with further cousins it is more easily allowed to say you do not know the person and you cannot help "everyone".
These cousins usually do not feel at home in their cousins family, and step over great discomfort to ask for help, only to be rejected or accepted for a mere few days.
Friends too avoid the poor person who used to be his friends.

All cases are motivated by the same thing, self-centeredness, selfishness and the fear of losing some of their materials to others.

This brings me to the point of who really are your brothers and sisters. As Jesus said, those who love Him are really it. And those who love Him will give their lives to Him and to their brothers and sisters as well.

*The one who gets wisdom loves life; the one who cherishes understanding will soon prosper.*
 
 
Thank You for all this wisdom, I am beginning to love life much more. Every time I know a little bit more what my purpose is what my purpose is not, I know where to go to. If I have somewhere to go to, life gets
more interesting for me.
 
 
*A false witness will not go unpunished, and whoever pours out lies will perish.*
*Proverbs 19:7‭-‬9 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.19.7-9.NIV*

I am not really certain of the meaning of this structure, but this verse is repeated in verse 5, which poetically usually indicates there is a center verse denoting the central theme of this proverb.

*It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury— how much worse for a slave to rule over princes!*
 
 
How is this applicable to me? Of course part is applicable to everyone. We are all fools, one more than the other, because we do foolish things, and even if we are not fools, as soon as we start living in luxury, we become fools. Why would anyone spend money on luxurious items when his brothers and sisters are in need?
To get back to the proverbs, the author is trying to make a statement here, the first being that princes have more than just luxury, which is true, they have power and connections as well.
The second statement would be that slaves are less fit to rule over princes than fools are to live in luxury. That I do not completely understand. Leaving aside the fact that some fools might have a talent for making money and that some slaves were forced to become slaves, but in fact could be very good rulers.

The Holy Spirit just gave me insight. I understand now, it is not about the capability of ruling, it is about the position. A slave is at the very bottom and a prince is at the very top. How can a slave decide for someone who is at the top already?

Still I am wondering how this applies to me. Does this mean that we, slaves for Jesus Christ, should not rule over the "princes", whoever they are, or rule over the prince of this world, which is the Satan?
 
 
*A person’s wisdom yields patience; it is to one’s glory to overlook an offense.*
 
 
Oh Lord, how long must this way of working go on? I really cannot work together with the people in my church who do not understand what organizational management is. I cannot work with people who are so self-centered and have such big egos that they are not willing to admit they are wrong whenever they are wrong.
But to me it is the goal to gain glory in such a situation, for I can overlook the offenses, and I can show my wisdom by showing patience.
How great it is to have an opportunity to show one's wisdom and gain glory, yet not too much because one needs to stay humble.
 
 
*A king’s rage is like the roar of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass.*
*Proverbs 19:10‭-‬12 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.19.10-12.NIV*

A king can be of two extremes indeed, he can kill you and he can award you like a prince. How should I treat him? Should I be afraid or grateful?
I think respect is fully due to him, but always less than to God.

*A foolish child is a father’s ruin, and a quarrelsome wife is like the constant dripping of a leaky roof.*
 
 
Not a stupid, dumb child, not an ugly or disabled one, but a foolish child will cause ruin to his father, to his mother as well, of course, but even more so to who leads the family.
The ruin can be financial, as in how parents solve everything for their children with money, by buying an expensive education or lawyers to get them out of trouble. It can also be familial, causing big breaches between family members, especially between those who want to help him and those who do not.
The love of the father for his child is causing his own ruin, but what choice has he got? He needs to obey the Lord's command to love everyone, right? Especially his children.
This is not completely true because I'm Proverbs 17 we already see that a wise person should not spend money on a fool for education. And so wisdom (as from Proverbs) can help deal with this awkward situation of helping, or not helping, a foolish child.

A quarrelsome wife is a bad thing as well. The quarrels she gets into are like the constant character of a dripping roof, it does not stop. And the consequences are far reaching as well, just like a wet floor can mold and will need to be fully replaced, the foundation of the marriage can mold and become weak and will need to be fully replaced.
Just like the roof cannot be fixed from the inside, so the marriage can only be fixed with a big operation and by doing it from the outside.
The outside meaning that you need it fix it with a third party, God, and someone to
 
 
*Houses and wealth are inherited from parents, but a prudent wife is from the Lord .*
 
 
In Chinese culture we often see that young men and women get
TODO OPZOEKEN uitgehuwelijkt
To someone their parents have chosen. Some people get to "choose" their own spouse. In either case case, it is not so much our choice as it is a gift from God.
A Christian couple or a God-fearing couple may very well choose a God-fearing wife for their son, and a man may choose a God-fearing wife for himself. In either case it is a gift from God, for God has prepared the woman for the man and the other way around.
So whether a spouse is chosen by a man himself or his parents, if she is a prudent wife, she is a gift from God, because no person gets to be prudent without God's help.

*Laziness brings on deep sleep, and the shiftless go hungry.*
*Proverbs 19:13‭-‬15 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.19.13-15.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.19.13-15.NIV)*
 
 
People who do not move at all, the *shiftless* (it seems like a term for zombies, like *sleepers* or the *undead* ) will become more tired. They think that resting will give them energy, but it only wears them out because they are not using what has been given to them. 
They will go hungry, because they have not worked.
 
 
*Whoever keeps commandments keeps their life, but whoever shows contempt for their ways will die.*
 
 
The Lord has given us commandments to not only stay alive, but to have an abundant life (cf. Jn 10:10).
If you show contempt, disregard or disrespect, you will most certainly die. On this planet everyone will die, but some will die sooner than others, and some in better ways than others.

*Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the Lord , and he will reward them for what they have done.*
 
 
Lending to the Lord sounds a bit strange to me. First of all, all of our money is His already, and so we would be returning it. And even if it were our own money we ought to give it instead of lending it. Also lending means getting something back. For sure I will get something from the Lord which is much better and more than anything I have given or lended Him, but it is not because I have lended Him something, because that would mean that I deserved to get something, and I deserve nothing, all of it is grace.

But I am misreading this verse, I think, for it says *who is kind to the poor, lends...* So that means that whoever is kind to the poor is already lending. Most probably with lending is meant here that you can be sure to get something from the Lord, disregarding the theological aspect of grace, but merely giving a figure of speech to make things clear. 
 
 
*Discipline your children, for in that there is hope; do not be a willing party to their death.*
*Proverbs 19:16‭-‬18 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.19.16-18.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.19.16-18.NIV)*

Your children still have a chance to come to the Lord. You, as a parent, play a huge role in that. You play a huge role in whether they are alive to Christ or dead. You even play a role in their personality.
And your children need discipline in order to come to Christ. This is one thing that is not dependent on talent.

*A hot-tempered person must pay the penalty; rescue them, and you will have to do it again.*
 
 
Do not rescue a hot tempered person. He will drain the energy out if you, because whatever you do for him, will not have any effect.
Let these people pay the price so that they will hopefully change.
 
 
*Listen to advice and accept discipline, and at the end you will be counted among the wise.*
 
 
Another way to save yourself a lot of energy is to listen to advise and accept discipline. Do not find out the hard way, why should you and would you want to? That is insane.
I know of a person who says he is the type to learn I the hard way, that is just how he is. He will not listen to other people's advise, but instead will have to do it three times and fail and then understand what is best for him.

*What a person desires is unfailing love ; better to be poor than a liar.*
*Proverbs 19:19‭-‬22 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.19.19-22.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.19.19-22.NIV)*

"Greed is a person's shame" is another translation of the first part of this proverb.

*It’s only human to want to make a buck, but it’s better to be poor than a liar.*
*Proverbs 19:22 MSG*
*http://bible.com/97/pro.19.22.MSG*

This is one of the more difficult verses at which I am stuck, because I do not know the real meaning. I think, however, that the Message paraphrase is quite correct in its interpretation.
I see that a person's love or desire for something is never failing. The things we want we will always want, if we do not get a new life in Christ. Take for example a person who has a crush on someone, like I I did in the days of my youth. This crush stayed through the years and even after high school my heart would start beating faster whenever I saw this (actually *these* ) specific girl(s). 
But still, this proverb says, to my understanding, it is better to stay in this desire than to actually have it. In the case of money for example it is better to be poor, than to let your desire for money overcome you and make you lie to make more money.

*The fear of the Lord leads to life; then one rests content, untouched by trouble.*
 
 
The fear spoken of here really is about a fear that makes you, not just awe and respect, it is about being afraid of what our God in heaven can do to your spirit until eternity.
But if you fear Him, your life will be abundant, you will find rest and though trouble may exist in life, it will just be around you, not touching you, for you are worried not about life here on Earth, but about life in heaven.
 
 
*A sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he will not even bring it back to his mouth!*
 
 
Be sure to know that laziness, sloth, sluggishness, different words for the same thing, all are things that God hates.
All things God requires of you, require diligence. Even if you rest in God, it does not mean you have to stop working, it just means that the reason you are working becomes different. You work, but you put the results in God's hands, the consequences are not a result of your labor, but of God's work.

*Flog a mocker, and the simple will learn prudence; rebuke the discerning, and they will gain knowledge.*
*Proverbs 19:23‭-‬25 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.19.23-25.NIV*

This is why it is so important to have the right interpretation of the term *the fear of the Lord*, because the right interpretation and application can change lives. 
People need to be flogged and rebuked, this is because we are so stubborn.

*Whoever robs their father and drives out their mother is a child who brings shame and disgrace.*
 
 
*How is this possible,* you might think, how can a child rob their own father. We do not have to talk about big amounts of money. Simply stealing from him is robbing him. 
Perhaps it goes even further. Doing things for you your father unwillingly needs to pay, is robbing him. If you get yourself into jail for example, and your father needs to pay your fine, you are robbing him of his money.
I'll take it even one step further. If your father pays for your provision and you do not take care of it, you are robbing him of his money. If he pays for your tuition and you mess up in school you are doing this. If he buys you a car and you wreck it, you are doing it again.
Even if your father is rich and does not care about money, stealing a dollar is still stealing, and wrecking a car or a toy, is still irresponsible behavior.
Either way, you are bringing shame on him.

I have not even started about driving out the mother. A mother is continually forgiving her children and for everything they do wrong. They defend the children when the father wants to punish them and works hard to take care of them.
Driving out a mother is by showing that all of her hard work was for nothing, and then showing you do not love her at all and had rather want her dead. This will she will see that her life has no purpose anymore.
Shame on the person who has done any of that.

*Stop listening to instruction, my son, and you will stray from the words of knowledge.*
 
 
Problems will occur as soon as you stop listening to your parents' instructions. When you stop listening to God's instructions you are going to get bigger things than problems, you will get into life-threatening situations and causing others to be in these as well.
 
 
*A corrupt witness mocks at justice, and the mouth of the wicked gulps down evil.*
 
 
You could say a corrupt witness is one the worst criminals. A person standing trial for a murder may be lying, but it is to defend himself, in order to stay out of prison. Why would a witness lie, it is not out of fear (unless he is being forced into it, but I am talking about corrupt witnesses), but for money. A criminal is lying to save his hide, a corrupt witness is lying to make some money.
This person could be called wicked by far. The difference between a bad person and a wicked person, is that a person may do some bad things, but for a reason. He wants to be rich, he does not have a good temper, or some other reason. But a wicked person *gulps down evil*, as this proverb says, does all kinds of bad things for no reason, just for fun. 
An example of this is the movie about sadists, *120 days of Sodom*, who have no reason to torture a few people just for fun and to know how people will react. They are wicked and contained of the satan, and so are those who enjoy these kind of movies. 
 
 
*Penalties are prepared for mockers, and beatings for the backs of fools.*
*Proverbs 19:26‭-‬29 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.19.26-29.NIV*

Just like with corrupt witnesses, mocking is worse than we think. It is not just a few words to laugh at someone, but it is an attitude that shows contempt for our fellowmen. It shows that the mocker does not only not care about someone, but also he is enjoying seeing someone suffer.
You might not agree with me, but why else would someone mock another person? Is it to build him up? No, it is to break him down. A person like this is not only a mocker but a fool as well, because he does not realize how much pain it causes and what it feels like to be mocked himself. But when he is mocked, he still is too foolish to realize he had been doing that himself all the time.
I do not think therefore that the mocker and the fool in this proverb are two different persons, they are the same and the one follows from the other.
This mocker deserves to be punished, penalized and receive backlashes. So serious is this offense.
