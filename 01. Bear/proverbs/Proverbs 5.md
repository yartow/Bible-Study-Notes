# Proverbs 5
*Warning Against Adultery*
*Proverbs 5:1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom,*
*turn your ear to my words of insight,*

Word of insight do not come automatically, we need to turn our ears, turn our heads, and sometimes turn our whole bodies for that.

*2 that you may maintain discretion*
*and your lips may preserve knowledge.*

Insight helps us to maintain discretion, to keep control of our lips. It will help us to not say something too quickly.
It may even help from a different way, it will preserve knowledge. Sometimes other people do not need knowledge, or they are not worthy of it. But we need wisdom to know this.

*3 For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,*
*and her speech is smoother than oil;*
*4 but in the end she is bitter as gall,*
*sharp as a double-edged sword.*
*5 Her feet go down to death;*
*her steps lead straight to the grave.*
*6 She gives no thought to the way of life;*
*her paths wander aimlessly, but she does not know it.*

Be aware that the adulterous woman does not even know herself that her paths wander aimlessly and that her steps lead straight to the grave. Trusting a person's intentions is not always a good way of judging whether something is good or bad.

In the same way, people who do not know God do not know they are leading other people on the path of death.

*Now then, my sons, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say.*
*Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house,*
*lest you lose your honor to others and your dignity to one who is cruel,*
*lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich the house of another.*

Do not just take another path, but take a path far from her.
In choosing jobs I wanted to choose a job with a high salary, in another I was aiming not for a high salary perse, but for a nice car or laptop, a different path but not far away from it.
I hope right now I am far enough away from it.

*At the end of your life you will groan, when your flesh and body are spent.*
*You will say, “How I hated discipline! How my heart spurned correction! I would not obey my teachers or turn my ear to my instructors.*
*And I was soon in serious trouble in the assembly of God’s people.”*
*Proverbs 5:7-14 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.5.7-14.NIV*

When looking in hindsight one always realizes what was wisdom. But even in the present it is possible to make wise decisions, by asking God for it. And God tells us to obey our instructors and teachers.
The consequences are serious, always for oneself, but for the people in God's assembly as well, for our brothers and sisters.
We destroy our fragile reputation as Christians when we do not use our wisdom. We destroy the fragile relationships between Christians in churches with many disputes, when we are harsh and rude.
Lord, give me wisdom to know how to serve You, Your body and accomplish the goals or purposes You have set for me.

*Drink water from your own cistern, running water from your own well.*
*Should your springs overflow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?*
*Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.*

This is clearly a piece concerning fidelity.
Your own cistern would refer to your own wife. But the springs and streams of water refer to one's sex life, that should not be shared with anyone.

*May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.*

The water could also refer to sperm as well as this fountain. Sperm should be kept for one's own wife, and blessed sperm will give many children.
This raises the question of donating sperm, is that allowed. When it is used for and one is against IVF then of course not, but if it is used for a normal procedure of fertilization?
In my opinion it is not a natural way to have children. Children are created *by* love out of a need *to* love and in fact they are literally *making* love, creating love for each other and their future child.
None of this happens in the process of fertilizing a cell or even when donating sperm in the natural way, by having sex with another woman.

*A loving doe, a graceful deer— may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be intoxicated with her love.*

A doe is innocent, never hurts anyone, only runs away when she is afraid, and graceful, a wonderful creature of God.
Lord, teach me to see and appreciate the wonderful things You have created, the character and dependency of a woman, the gracefulness of obedience to You.

*Why, my son, be intoxicated with another man’s wife? Why embrace the bosom of a wayward woman?*
*Proverbs 5:15-20 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.5.15-20.NIV*

Let me not compare my wife with anyone else, for another woman is someone I can only view from the outside.

*21 For your ways are in full view(P) of the Lord,*
*and he examines(Q) all your paths.(R)*

I have nothing to hide for my Lord, He knows everything, He knows every way I go.

*22 The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare them;(S)*
*the cords of their sins hold them fast.(T)*

If I spend too much time with the wicked, or viewing the wicked (such as watching movies) their evil deeds will ensnare me. Materialism then is what I will long for, because that is what they show all the time on tv.
It is like a cord, from which I cannot be set loose. But thank God it seemed like I have been. Yesterday when Mohamed told me about his experience in a 500 dollar sushi place and his ride in a Lamborghini, I felt envious (only about the Lamborghini ride) but in a different way than before, not that I wanted it, but more like why does he get this chance? Even more so, I felt that it was wrong for him to enjoy these things he wants to have so bad, because it is precisely what he wants to have. And the devil is exactly using that.

*23 For lack of discipline they will die,(U)*
*led astray by their own great folly.*

Please help Mohamed, Lord, because the verse seems to be more and more applicable to him. Teach him discipline in all fields, in losing weight, in studying Your Word, in applying himself in materialism and impulsiveness.
Let him know what his great folly is.
