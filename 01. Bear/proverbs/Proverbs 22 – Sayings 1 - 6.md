# Proverbs 22 – Sayings 1 - 6
*A good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold.*
 
 
There are many things I strive for, and I am not sure if I can say it is unknowingly, but money is one of them.
It seems my purpose is to reach the tool, while the tool should help me reach my purpose. For this reason I have often lost hope, because I had the wrong purpose in eyesight.
I am talking about gadgets here. Gadgets are one way to make your life efficient and effective, so that we can spend less time on overhead and administration and more time on the things that matter, serving God and serving others.
I always had, and perhaps still have, a high tech gadget in eyesight, such as a Mac, and then an SSD to speed things up, then the latest Android, at the time a Motorola Nexus 6. I got all of these things eventually, plus a MacBook Pro, 2.2 GHz, i7, 16GB RAM. And still I was not satisfied.
I still had the feeling that I was missing something. That *something* most definitely was "a purpose", but I did not know what. 
I do not have this feeling towards computers anymore, although I still hope for a new computer that I can strive for. At the time of writing, approximately 9 November 2016, the new MacBook Pro came out with a small touch sensitive LED strip. It was nothing special and that bothered me. I wanted it to be special, so I had a purpose to strive for, to pursue.
Another thing I am hoping for is a newer and faster car. In fact I am slightly frustrated with what my current car does not have, which is part of the reason why I want a new car.
Looking at the present, and noticing what is wrong about it, in order to form a better conception of the future is a method, but it does not provide a full view. It only provides what I see and experience as frustrating in my life. That is so narrow.

You can see two recurring misconceptions that prevent me from *seeing* my purpose my purpose – I am not even talking about *reaching* my purpose yet! The first thing is that I am viewing the tool as my purpose instead of looking at the goal itself. The second thing is that I am not looking forward nor I'm a wide angle, but looking at the present, which is – if you think about it – the past as soon as I have said it, and in a small angle of life only.
 
 
*Rich and poor have this in common: The Lord is the Maker of them all.*
 
 
I have enough be very careful of myself not to let myself fall into this trap of making money. See my notes on the previous verse. Just like I am fooled by making the tool my purpose instead of using this tool to reach my purpose, I am fooled again by making money my purpose while money is only a tool to buy or get to my purpose, which in this case are gadgets, which are not end purposes but tools themselves.
So I am fooled twice, even worse than a donkey.

Whether people are fools or not, some succeed in this foolishness and are deemed rich, in he terms of this world. Others do not succeed and are deemed poor. They have at least this one thing in common, which is that they both are foolish for pursuing money.
But another more important thing they have in common is that the Lord has created them both. Even when they are not foolish, they have been created by the Maker.
 
 
*The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.*
*Proverbs 22:1‭-‬3 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.22.1-3.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.22.1-3.NIV)*

It is a good thing to see danger, not everyone has this ability. It is a wise thing to listen to it.
The simple, as opposed to the wise, do not listen to their feelings and ignore the talent they have to sense danger and go straight through it, without a purpose.
They are not going into the danger to save a person or to serve God, rather they do this because they think they can outsmart God or lady Fortuna. In fact gambling is a perfect example for this verse. The prudent see the danger of it and the simple probably see it as well. Better yet, they should know it even better because they have experienced danger of gambling. Some have had debts, been beaten up, got their house sold and everything they owned taken away, and then being left by their spouse and children. Yet they continue gambling. 
They of all people know about the dangers of gambling and yet they are so simple to keep doing that. Though they have paid a big part of the penalty that awaits them, they are willing to pay more, just to have this feeling of winning again, or just to fill this gap of hope to someday become rich.

Their purpose is to satisfy their feeling, while it is their feeling that told them in the first instance that it was dangerous. Yet they chose to choose to listen to the that satisfied themselves.

But the simple are not evil, they have "merely" been led away by evil into doing bad things. And the answer to getting rid of this addiction, as with any addiction, is humility, which we will see in the next verse.

*Humility is the fear of the Lord ; its wages are riches and honor and life.*
 
 
If I really want to have honor and riches, and live to enjoy it, the way to it is not the worldly way but the spiritual way. If I follow the spiritual way, however, worldly riches, honor and life will eventually not be worth anything to me anymore, because I will get something better in return, namely heavenly riches, honor from God and eternal life.
What will those heavenly riches be? Imagine the greatest thing you want to have, and the joy and peace you are getting from that, and now imagine this feeling, but an infinite number of times better. That is how it feels in heaven. Those are the riches.
 
 
*In the paths of the wicked are snares and pitfalls, but those who would preserve their life stay far from them.*
 
 
As can be seen, everything in heaven is better than on Earth and heaven is the place where we will see and know God perfectly. That should be our purpose, to know Him, not know about Him, but to know Him intimately and follow Him. I dare to say it is not possible to know Him intimately and not follow Him, because He is so full of love.
So the right way to walk this path is to not preserve your life. Everything you are doing to preserve yir life and make your life better, will only lead you to more pitfalls and snares. Many Christians will not know this, but they have invested so much in their house to make it comfortable, that they have left the church because their house is more comfortable.
They are spending a lot of time on their studies or work, so that they can make more money to live more comfortable. What is wrong about that is what they are giving up. This time, that should have been spent on serving God and others and to get in contact with Him, is now spent on themselves or their children.
Know that serving others includes serving your children. But spending your time to give your child extra (unnecessary) tuition, sports and dancing classes, does not have priority over serving others.
 
 
 
 
*Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it.*
*Proverbs 22:4‭-‬6 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.22.4-6.NIV*

Thank You, Father, for giving me this blessing from a young age on and blessing my mother as well with three of her children believing and following You.
Thanksgiving You that my brother is walking with You more closely than a few years ago.
Thank You for setting Nathan up on this path. I pray that You will let him stay on this path his whole life. Never to stray from it, but always to walk on it a fearing Your Word.
Let You be his guide and lamp, so that he will know what his purpose and direction is.
 
 
*7 The rich rule over the poor,*
*and the borrower is slave to the lender.*
 
 

This verse is different in that it merely states an observation, made almost three thousand years ago, but still valid today. It is not judging or providing any way out, it is just a fact. But put into contexts with the rest of Proverbs, you might be able to see it is related and fits in the context. Namely, the lazy ones (or sluggards) will not become rich, the wicked will be punished, and those who happen to be rich (as in v.9 below) will be blessed when they are generous (although poor people can be generous as well of course). So these proverbs are providing advice to the rich and the poor.
 
 
*8 Whoever sows injustice reaps calamity,*
*and the rod they wield in fury will be broken.*
 
 
In history, and not even that lang ago, we have seen that this is a true statement. What comes to mind are African dictators who ...please ... themselves with corruption and injustice.
TODO OPZOEKEN verheerlijken
Shortly after the country will rise and rebel. Injustice does not have any fruits but bad ones and if corruption starts with the leader, it will seep down into other layers.
 
 
*9 The generous will themselves be blessed,*
*for they share their food with the poor.*
 
 
God will not overlook the generous people. He has given them – not by merit but by grace – wealth with a purpose, namely to serve God by serving the poor.
How good would it not be if the billionaires in this world decided not to save all of their money for themselves, but use it to help their country and people? How good would it not be if the talented and smart people use their gifts and fame to support the kingdom of God?
Yesterday I read about King Bhumipol of Thailand, 80 years old now and the longest monarch ever. Almost being worshipped like a God in every Thai person's home.
His country is a major source for pedophiles and soliciting of underage and adult prostitution, many if not all being forced in this trade of business and even going so far as to undergo gender changes to make money.
Yet the king keeps his staggering 35 billion in a fund, not being used at all for the country.
He is blessed with a long life, but it seems like this blessing came from the devil. Buddhism worship is all over the country, drug and human trafficking occur on the borders and poverty is everywhere.

*Drive out the mocker, and out goes strife; quarrels and insults are ended.* 

Sometimes it is just one person who is responsible for the strife that is going on. Think of this person and work it out, but I pray that it is not you.
Instead of going against his word and starting quarrels and insults, simply remove him or avoid him.

*One who loves a pure heart and who speaks with grace will have the king for a friend.*
 
 
Do not be tempted by what this world has to offer, which is mostly on the outside. Do not love those people who are famous or talented, like football players or actresses, do not love them for what they have, but love those who who have a pure heart. If you can do so, you have a pure heart as well.
If you have this mind of attitude, even kings can appreciate that, especially the Almighty King in heaven.
 
 
*The eyes of the Lord keep watch over knowledge, but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.*
*Proverbs 22:10‭-‬12 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.22.10-12.NIV*

*De ogen des HEEREN bewaren de wetenschap; maar de zaken des trouwelozen zal Hij omkeren.*
*Spreuken 22:12 SV1750*
*[http://bible.com/165/pro.22.12.SV1750](http://bible.com/165/pro.22.12.SV1750)*
 
 
*The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.*
*Proverbs 22:12 KJV*
[http://bible.com/1/pro.22.12.KJV](http://bible.com/1/pro.22.12.KJV)

I have added a few translations to the NIV that I normally use, because I am not sure of the original meaning of the word *frustrates.* It got my attention, because I am frequently frustrated with how things go in church. However, in this verse this concerns the unfaithful, so that is not positive for me.
On the other hand, it could be that it is the words of the unfaithful that frustrate me.
Looking deeper into the original meaning of this word, I see that it has not much to do with frustration itself. It is more like *overthrowing* or *turning around,* whereas *words* can be translated as *matter* as well. 

Still, there is a small discrepancy between these and other verses from Proverbs. It is not comparing two equal things, like fools and wise, which both are human. This verse compared knowledge with the unfaithful. Or so I thought. It turns out that the comparison is with the *words of* the unfaithful. 

*The sluggard says, “Thereʼs a lion outside! Iʼll be killed in the public square!”*
 
 
The sluggards will think of any excuse to escape any work to do. Even if it is to merely leave his house they will think of fantastic things like lions.
The politicians nowadays, like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, are not sluggers according to the word lyrics definition, but they sure earn their money in an easy way.
 
 
*The mouth of an adulterous woman is a deep pit; a man who is under the Lord ʼs wrath falls into it.*
 
 
If you are under the lords wrath, you will fall into the woman's pit. In other words, God will use the woman to let you fail and fall.
 
 
*Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline will drive it far away.*
*Proverbs 22:13‭-‬15 NIV*
http://bible.com/111/pro.22.13-15.NIV

So children are naturally inclined to folly? I think so yes. Even if it is not the environment, a child will easily turn bad if it is not trained to listen to God.

*One who oppresses the poor to increase his wealth and one who gives gifts to the rich—both come to poverty.* 

There surely is a lot of oppression of the poor in this world, and a lot of "giving gifts". It seems like this verse is specifically meant for Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, although I am wondering whether the conclusion is true as well, namely that they will come to poverty.

***Thirty sayings of the wise***
***Saying 1.***
 
 
*Pay attention and turn your ear to the sayings of the wise; apply your heart to what I teach,*
*for it is pleasing when you keep them in your heart and have all of them ready on your lips.*
*So that your trust may be in the Lord , I teach you today, even you.*
*Have I not written thirty sayings for you, sayings of counsel and knowledge, teaching you to be honest and to speak the truth, so that you bring back truthful reports to those you serve?*
*Proverbs 22:16‭-‬21 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.22.16-21.NIV*

It seems like these sayings were written for a messenger and a servant, because of the mention of reporting and serving. Indirectly he would probably refer to us, Christians, because that is what we are, messengers and servants.
..
Please let my trust be in You, Lord. Today many things have happened even though it is not even half past 9 yet. Many fines I have received, for speeding and not paying for parking and even fines for notboaying those fines.
Let my trust be in You and let not my worries overshadow Your grace and blessings.

***Saying 2***
*Do not exploit the poor because they are poor and do not crush the needy in court,*
*for the Lord will take up their case and will exact life for life.*
*Proverbs 22:22‭-‬23 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.22.22-23.NIV*

Too often some people see chances to make money and the easiest way is to seek those who have a big need. Ironically it is the poor who have the biggest needs yet do no have any money to pay for it. This makes them vulnerable for all kinds of exploitation, such as selling themselves or their children.
They are the most easy group to exploit and world wide we see forms of slavery, like people in India who cannot pay off their debts and end up working long hours in stone factories, together with his sons.
Or people in Thailand selling off their children as prostitutes, whether knowingly or unknowingly. The worst things happen to these group of people because they have no one to help them, protect them educate and empower them in becoming independent.
Of course there instances like micro credits giving them a chance to build a new future, but these are time costly. Proposals need to be reviewed and people need to gather a ransom and everything needs to be administrated.
The PEACE plan probably gets most near an ultimate and optimal solution, but it gets help from the Rwandan President and that of other countries. Would it work in corrupt countries and in countries with a lot of opposition like India and the Philippines where slave owners, and Hindus and the sex industry will not be glad with these initiatives?

***Saying 3***
*Do not make friends with a hot-tempered person, do not associate with one easily angered, or you may learn their ways and get yourself ensnared.*
*Proverbs 22:24‭-‬25 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.22.24-25.NIV*

It is true that it is so easy to be acquainted with the bad habits of bad tempered people. We ourselves already have problems keeping our own temper, every minute spent with this bad tempered person is a minute of temptation.

***Saying 4***
*Do not be one who shakes hands in pledge or puts up security for debts; if you lack the means to pay, your very bed will be snatched from under you.*
*Proverbs 22:26‭-‬27 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.22.26-27.NIV*

The Lord is very clear on putting up security for someone else. As much as we are obliged to help others in need, He explicitly forbids us to put up security for someone. Putting up security is like a blank cheque, they can do anything and put you in debt. And debt is what our Lord does not want us to be in.
How can I get rid of my credit cards? By never using it again anymore.

***Saying 5***
*Do not move an ancient boundary stone set up by your ancestors.*
*Proverbs 22:28 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.22.28.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.22.28.NIV)*

I misread this one, I thought it was talking about a mere stone, but it is not. It is a *boundary* stone. In other words, you're forefathers or ancestors had a reason for setting up this boundary. From their wise experience they knew what was bad for them. Even if they were not religious or heathens, and even if they were selfish, this will show what was healthy for themselves.
We can apply everything within this boundary. Within this boundary it is safe. We might go over this boundary, but at least know of its existence and we can ask God if we should trespass it.
For example, my parents did not want me to enlist. It is perhaps not a bad thing perse, but for sure if I stay within this boundary I will stay safe.

***Saying 6***
*Do you see someone skilled in their work? They will serve before kings; they will not serve before officials of low rank.*
*Proverbs 22:29 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.22.29.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.22.29.NIV)*

Someone skilled is not only someone who is talented. It takes effort, discipline, motivation and a very long time as well.
God will reward those people. Very often we see them in TV, those people who stand out because of what they do. Examples of these are kids in India without arms, who fix watches with their feet, or the surfer Bethany Murphy who kept surfing with only one arm.
A lot of these people are unseen as well, but God sees them and rewards them in His own way.

In a sense, those who diligently strive for perfection, if it is for a good cause, are serving a king, the King the Universe, which is God.
The example of the protagonist in the book *Catch me if you can,* Frank Abagnale, has also served God, not with his fraud, but using his forner experience with fraud to prevent it. 

TODO sermon about false negative and positive.
Positive doesn't always mean it's good. It just means you have it.
