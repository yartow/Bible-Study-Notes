# Proverbs 14
*1 The wise woman builds her house,*

*but with her own hands the foolish one tears hers down.*
 
 
I was thinking about in what way a woman can tear her own house down, but it did not take me long to think of one. A woman who cheats on her husband with another man, is one to destroy her own family. With all the gifts she has received to build a family, and perhaps she already has built one, she is now destroying it all. For what? Probably a few years of happiness.
Such a woman is not worth giving your life to. A foolish woman like that will destroy your house as well.

*2 Whoever fears the Lord walks uprightly,*
*but those who despise him are devious in their ways.*
 
 
The people who despise the Lord, there are not any worse than such people. They despise their own creator, the One Who has given them everything.
And even though they do not realize that, they do know that Christians do not cause harm to others. They create funds and foundations to help the poor, go abroad and do welfare. But still not a bit of gratitude is seen in there. All they care about is the fact that Christians have a double agenda, that is to convert unbelievers into believing in Christ their Savior.
This is not even a double agenda at all, Christians are very clear about that.
But the reason the world moves all that good stuff Christians do on the side, and the reason why they are so against Christians, is because Christians are against abortion and gay marriages. Put otherwise, Christians are restricting freedom and discriminating.
This might seem logical, but it is not when you look at the numbers. How many gays are affected when gay marriage is not allowed anymore? How many woman are affected when abortion is not allowed? Much less than the number of people living in poverty or are sick. Would it be justified to stop Christians from doing work in all these countries so a handful of people have more freedom?
Secondly, gays might have one right less if he law was based on the Bible, that is the right to marry, but if the whole world were Christian, gays would be accepted and loved far more than in a world without Christians. Anothet consequence would be that there would ultimately be less gays, because Christians stimulate good sexual education and healthy families, while many if not all gays come from unhealthy families, even if they do not realize it.
Lastly, the number of abortions would become less, couples without children would have a child, young women would not be traumatized by forcibly aborting their pregnancy. Better yet, with good sexual education and healthy families there would not even be any unplanned pregnancy.

*3 A fool’s mouth lashes out with pride,*
*but the lips of the wise protect them.*
 
 
You are right, Lord, for pride is indeed causing me to behave like this. Yesterday I had an argument with my wife about not being grateful and wanting to be taken care of. I was telling her not to complain and that if she does not want ingratitude she should not do it. Or in other words, she should not do it for the gratitude.
She on the other hand told me that an easier alternative would be to just be grateful. That is true, but I could not comply with that because of my pride. To be grateful would be to give something of my pride away. To admit I lost the discussion would chip away some of my pride as well.
To admit to giving gratitude would mean that I like being taken care of and that is contradictory to the image I have of a man, who should not be taken care for.
 
 
*4 Where there are no oxen, the manger is empty,*
*but from the strength of an ox come abundant harvests.*
 
 
I feel like this is something that has to do with my work. We have little money, and only a few workers. We need someone strong to have abundant harvests. Of course we are missing one factor here and that is God, but for sure a disciplined man, a God-fearing man, would help.
 
 
*5 An honest witness does not deceive,*
*but a false witness pours out lies.*
 
 
If I am honest I do not need to lie to convince others. I do not even need to exaggerate, all I need to do is tell the truth and people will believe me. Right now people do not believe me and that may be because I have not gained their trust, perhaps because I have not always been trustworthy.

*6 The mocker seeks wisdom and finds none,*
*but knowledge comes easily to the discerning.*
 
 
I truly remember having written something here, about me being able to find wisdom, not because I am able but because it was given to me, by pastors among others, but ultimately by God. I do not know why this has been deleted.
Perhaps God did not want me to write it. I will look up the history of this note to see if my changes have been saved.

In any case, if I have to answer whether it comes easy, I cannot easily give an answer to that. What is easy? I had to study for that, read books, although I am presently not studying or reading a lot anymore.
So currently, yes, it comes easy. All I have to do is ask someone. And when the answer is written in a book all I had to do is read it. Of course I cannot say often enough that it is through God's grace that I can do anything, such as have the money to buy a book, to know that it is this book I must read, to have the concentration and intelligence to understand the book. But compared to others, I feel it comes easy.

This should make me more humble and willing to help others who do not have it as easy as I have and teaching them. That is what I am doing, in Sunday school and discipleship and fellowships. I am even teaching at Celebrate Recovery classes.
But it still feels like I am missing something. Perhaps there is more I can teach others. I am not sure, but perhaps it has to do with my envisioned purpose and passion, to go to Africa and help out building villages.

*7 Stay away from a fool,*
*for you will not find knowledge on their lips.*
 
 
Perhaps some people should stay away from me. I have almost certainly influenced people with my hatred, disrespect and arrogance towards some. It had been better for them to not be near me.
The authority given to me by God, though unofficial, I have not used in the right way. I am not fit yet to become a leader of a big group.
I do not even know if I am fit for anything at all right now.
 
 
*8 The wisdom of the prudent is to give thought to their ways,*
*but the folly of fools is deception.*
 
 
In other words, you are prudent when you think about your actions, before and after you have done them. But a fool deceives others and does not rethink his actions.
 
 
*9 Fools mock at making amends for sin,*
*but goodwill is found among the upright.*
 
 
A fool does not only not rethink his actions, but he mocks those who do. When you meet the upright, on the other hand, you will find goodwill among them.
In the original translation it says the fools will deny their mistakes and even turn them into a pretty lie, as if they did it for a good cause.
What is goodwill? In this case it means that an upright person will not cover his mistakes. He is *will* ing to admit his mistakes. 
 
 
*10 Each heart knows its own bitterness,*
*and no one else can share its joy.*
 
 
If you are wise, you will understand that each person has things it is bitter for which other people cannot understand. At the same time it is joyful for things other people cannot understand either.
If someone else is bitter and you cannot cheer him up, do not think he is stubborn for staying in his emotional state. Understand that you cannot understand him.
As for others who do not understand you, understand that they cannot understand your happiness and why you want something so bad.

Why am I so bitter? Can I even understand it myself?
I think I have been bitter to my wife for the past few days because she asked me to clean up the house. In part my bitterness is caused by doing something I do not like, for another part it is because I feel I have been robbed of my freedom. I *have* to do this, in order to prevent arguments at home. No other reason than that. 
Why should I clean up? It is not my mess, it is first of all her responsibility, and second of all she wants it to be tidy.
Now I cannot even have my friend come over before asking her for permission.
All I can do is get even by not giving her her pleasures, was my plan. I will clean up the house, but I will not let her enjoy marriage. My presence will not be part of this house. She has taken my house from me, now she can enjoy it by herself, I thought.
But I realize my duty as a husband, my first duty. And even tho she has some duties of herself as well, my duty I must perform before all else and that is to love her, more than I love myself.
So if I know that she harbors some kind of bitterness in her because of the house, even though I cannot understand it, and she is taking a desperate measure by forcing her husband to do something, I have to solve the first part which is causing the bitterness, and not the second part, which she is using as a solution.
If I love her I will show her my love by cleaning up the house. But I must not keep a record of wrong. I must not keep in mind what she has done to me, but forgive and forget.
 
 
*11 The house of the wicked will be destroyed,*
*but the tent of the upright will flourish.*
 
 
I hope my house will flourish, because if this family does not work out, Nathan will not become the man I want him to be.
 
 
*12 There is a way that appears to be right,*
*but in the end it leads to death.*
 
 
It seemed right to me to be angry, it seemed right to me to take revenge, but it all led to my own death. I have not died, thanks to God, but if I had continued my way I would have. Perhaps not physically, but morally I would have died, and my soul would have ended up in hell.
 
 
*13 Even in laughter the heart may ache,*
*and rejoicing may end in grief.*
 
 
Do not think that when you see someone laughing he is not hurting within. Do not think that a joyful moment will always stay joyful. We do not know what will happen or what will is happening right now (on the inside).
So we do not know anything at all actually. What are we laughing for then, but also what are we crying for?
 
 
*14 The faithless will be fully repaid for their ways,*
*and the good rewarded for theirs.*
 
 
Being repaid in this sense means something negative. It is not even the wicked who are mentioned here, but the faithless. The faithless could even be believers who at that moment do not have faith in the Lord. Those who do not trust in the Lord will get what they deserve. If they decide to go their own way, a way without hope in something better than this world can provide provide, then they will get what they chose for. Little faith will be repaid with little result. That is how it works in life.
The good people, as opposed to the faithless, which in essence means that the faithless are the bad, will not be paid but rewarded. I think there is a reason why this specific word has been chosen.
A reward is given for a certain achievement. When one has faith, and actually shows it by undertaking something with a high risk of failure, I think this person has achieved something. He did not count on luck or on his own talents, but on God as His sole Provider.
 
 
*15 The simple believe anything,*
*but the prudent give thought to their steps.*
 
 
In verse 8 the prudent made their appearance. Where fools are deceived because they do not give thought to things, the prudent do, which is their wisdom. Yet again the simple, as opposed to the fools – but which probably refers to the same people – believe *anything*. 
But see also the next verse.

*16 The wise fear the Lord and shun evil,*
*but a fool is hotheaded and yet feels secure.*
 
 
The wise, because they give thought to things before they do them, will shun evil, that means they will avoid it at all costs. But the fools, because they have not given thought or not enough thought to it, think they have given enough thought and think they are up for whatever danger is coming.
 
 
*17 A quick-tempered person does foolish things,*
*and the one who devises evil schemes is hated.*
 
 
Indeed, I was the one devising evil schemes and I was quick-tempered.
 
 
*18 The simple inherit folly,*
*but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.*
 
 
As a result, the simple will inherit folly, which is a lack of good sense or judgment.
While the prudent, who think before they do, will be crowned with knowledge, for new things they will learn.
 
 
*19 Evildoers will bow down in the presence of the good,*
*and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.*
 
 
Eventually it will be the good who will conquer, but we will not conquer for ourselves, but for God's Kingdom. The evildoers will bow down, yet not for the good, but for God and merely in the presence of the good.
 
 
*20 The poor are shunned even by their neighbors,*
*but the rich have many friends.*
 
 
I do not know what wisdom is in here. This is merely a fact. It is not calling us to become right, I suppose. If tone is cynical, then it probably says:
*But the rich have many "friends"*
Or in other words, so-called friends, who only stay with you as long as you are rich.
The poor on the other hand are shunned by their neighbors, but at least that shunning is real.
 
 
*21 It is a sin to despise one’s neighbor,*
*but blessed is the one who is kind to the needy.*
 
 
A good complementary verse to the sermon we had yesterday, in May 22nd, 2016, in the Rotterdam Chinese church, by Ies Maaswinkel.
Being kind to the needy is one thing, but what if the needy is your enemy?
Lord, teach me to love them. Those enemies who are far from me are not even really my enemies, but those who are near me, those I should love and those are the hardest to love.
 
 
*22 Do not those who plot evil go astray?*
*But those who plan what is good find[a] love and faithfulness.*
 
 
And now You have given me the answer, Lord, on how to find love and faithfulness as well. I have to plan what is good. Lord, if it is Your will, let us plan an event for Open Doors to make people aware of what is happening in this world. Let Christians stand up and pray for heir brothers and sisters. Let them be interested in knowing how they are being persecuted.
 
 
*23 All hard work brings a profit,*
*but mere talk leads only to poverty.*
 
 
Mere talk would bring nothing, I thought, but it is worse than that, it brings even less than nothing, it brings poverty. Losing money, losing reliability, losing faith from friends and students, because one cannot keep his word or walk the talk.
One will lose credentials.
Most importantly, one will lose himself. He will not know anymore what is truth or lie.

*24 The wealth of the wise is their crown,*
*but the folly of fools yields folly.*
 
 
Being with foolish people will yield foolish things, that is folly. But hang out with wise people, no it is not about hanging out.
 
 
*25 A truthful witness saves lives,*
*but a false witness is deceitful.*
 
 
In reality, in court, a truthful witness saves lives, but even outside the court the truth can make or break someone's reputation.
Stay truthful, even if you think it will not hurt anyone, because someone's life might be at stake here.

*26 Whoever fears the Lord has a secure fortress,*
*and for their children it will be a refuge.*
 
 
If you want the best for your children, if you want to protect them from the devil, your biggest task is to fear the Lord. Only when you enter the Lord's fortress, your children will find refuge as well.
 
 
*27 The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life,*
*turning a person from the snares of death.*
 
 
More than that, the fear of the Lord will give life. It will prevent you from going to places that would ultimately or directly kill you and your faith, and in doing so killing many others as well.
 
 
*28 A large population is a king’s glory,*
*but without subjects a prince is ruined.*
 
 
Even though our King does not need a population, He can create any army even if He does not have one, but He does not even need an army, for His Word can create and destroy everything.
But it is important to think about what I need. If I want to be decision-maker of all things in church and by getting there make everyone or most of them into my enemies, then there is no church to make decisions for, because people are the church.
 
 
*29 Whoever is patient has great understanding,*
*but one who is quick-tempered displays folly.*
 
 
As long as I stay patient, I might understand some of the things God has given and shown me. But if I am quick-tempered, that will show folly.
 
 
*30 A heart at peace gives life to the body,*
*but envy rots the bones.*
 
 
If I have peace, I will have life as it should truly be lived. I would feel comfortable in my own body.
As for the spiritual analogy, this would mean in more concrete terms that being comfortable means to be satisfied with one's life. Am I satisfied right now with my body, first of all? Am I ashamed of my body?
On a deeper level we get to the inside. Am I satisfied with the talents I have?
On a much higher level, am I satisfied with the income I have, and my fiends, my wife and my children, or even my parents?
Because if I am not satisfied, I will look at what others have and long to have that until it becomes envy.
Everything around you and what you live in, that is your body.
Now your bones are what is inside of you and they are, almost literally, the core of your body, that which hold up everything.
I have heard it said that bone cancer is one of the most painful cancers there is. Some cancers might make you vomit, give you diarrhea, or chemo might make your hair fall out and lose weight, but bone cancer will hurt throughout your whole body with every movement you make, and probably even standing or sitting, whatever puts strain on your bones through gravity, which is always present,

Now in more concrete terms, we are talking about envy, hatred, insecurity, addictions and all the other negative feelings we have as a cause of, probably, what someone else has.
Now these things will slowly eat you up from the inside, if you let them, and they will hurt you all the time, because just like gravity, they are present all the time. If you have hatred, you can only suppress it for a second, before it pops up in your mind again. If your are envious of someone or something, you will see it everywhere.
An envy of someone's money for example is seen whenever you look at friends who go on a holiday, people driving around in new cars, people buying new cell phones or computers.
 
 
*31 Whoever oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker,*
*but whoever is kind to the needy honors God.*
 
 
But in whatever we long for so much, we must not look up to those who have it, but rather to those who do not, because they are the strong ones, being able to live without these worldly materials. The wealthy ones on the other hand are in fact weaker, generally speaking, for they are relying on more on their wealth and living in luxury.
 
 
*32 When calamity comes, the wicked are brought down,*
*but even in death the righteous seek refuge in God.*
 
 
In times of calamity, however, these wealthy ones are not prepared or trained in prayer and to rely on God. They have not prepared themselves by asking God for His protection before the calamity and during the calamity. They do not know how to live day by day without planning and hoping that God will foresee and have faith and take steps in faith.
 
 
*33 Wisdom reposes in the heart of the discerning*
*and even among fools she lets herself be known.[b]*
 
 
No matter how foolish people are, wisdom will always be shown in some way. Unfortunately it might not be enough to make hem change their ways, but they will see the existence of it. Some might change and some might influence others in living a good life.
So living my whole life in wisdom, sacrificing myself for hundreds of fools, of which perhaps only two will become wise as a cause of my sacrifice, would that be worth it?
My first answer is no. I would not be satisfied with converting, if you will, of only two people. Would I have lived then my whole life ministering God with an effect on only two people? Except for exceptional cases, where I would live on a deserted island or village with only a handful of people, yes, then I would have accepted that, but not with teeming millions of lost people all around me.
But even aside ffrom the purpose God has given me to spread His Word and Good News of His work, reaching only two people is almost always too few.

But being wise is not a sacrifice for others, it is for oneself. It is to free oneself from foolishness, wrong decisions which one will regret all of one's life. It is to live a better and more satisfying life.
Am I living satisfied right now? I think I am living in the edge of satisfaction.

 
 
*34 Righteousness exalts a nation,*
*but sin condemns any people.*
 
 
Whatever the case, no matter poor or rich, foolish or wise, stay righteous, do not commit any sin. For this sin will condemn you, and even though you will be forgiven if you ask God for forgiveness, you might reap the consequences of your own or someone else's sin.
 
 
*35 A king delights in a wise servant,*
*but a shameful servant arouses his fury.*
 
 
Do you want to work for the King? Do you have God in mind or some human being? Either way, they both like wise servants. Through wisdom you will get get his delight and your pleasure,
