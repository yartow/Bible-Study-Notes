# Proverbs 9
*Wisdom has built her house; she has set up its seven pillars.*
http://www.gotquestions.org/seven-pillars-wisdom.html

It is very easy to see where wisdom lives. It is raised high and very recognizable. What are those seven pillars? Perhaps they have a symbolic meaning, relating to the seven sins or seven virtues.

*She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; she has also set her table.*

Wisdom has also prepared a lot of material, books I would say, but also wise words of men and women, inspired by her. Materials that can be absorbed by our body.

*She has sent out her servants, and she calls from the highest point of the city,*
*“Let all who are simple come to my house!” To those who have no sense she says,*
*“Come, eat my food and drink the wine I have mixed.*
*Leave your simple ways and you will live; walk in the way of insight.”*
*Proverbs 9:1-6 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.9.1-6.NIV*

I would say it is impossible to miss her. She is shouting from the highest points of the city. Who could not see her? Perhaps only those who have sunk very deep.

*Whoever corrects a mocker invites insults; whoever rebukes the wicked incurs abuse.*

Father, let me restrain myself in correcting and rebuking people. In my arrogance I think I can do everything and leave them be. Even if I do not care whether they hate or love me, I must care about the fact that they must love you. And if they cannot feel I love them, they cannot feel you love them either.

*Do not rebuke mockers or they will hate you; rebuke the wise and they will love you.*

Why rebuke those who will hate you, instead of rebuking those who will love you - and thank you - for your rebuke and wise words.
Do not be fooled into thinking that the words wisdom gave you were not correct. It is not the response you receive that determines whether what you said was wisdom, however, wisdom not only tells you what to say but also whom to say it to.

*Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; teach the righteous and they will add to their learning.*
*Proverbs 9:7-9 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.9.7-9.NIV*

Furthermore, one must think to himself what is more effective. Teaching someone who does not want to be taught, or someone who does want to learn and change his ways.
This is a difficult question, for if effectivity were the goal, should we never teach troubled kids anymore?

*The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.*

Fear the Lord and fear only Him. If I cannot understand that I should fear nothing, but Him, I am not fearing Him enough. If I am willing to give in to the enemy because I fear him, I obviously do not fear the Lord enough to know what He can do to me if I give in to the Satan.

Understanding is a difficult thing. Memorizing is easy, but seeing how things work is hard. Fortunately, all we need to do is know our Lord better. Know His love, His righteousness and compassion for us, and then we will understand more of the ways of life.

*For through wisdom your days will be many, and years will be added to your life.*

Many years in your life are not worth much if I live my life as a mocker and a fool. But when I live it as a wise man, I live longer, I can do more with my time and have so much more effect on the world around me.

*If you are wise, your wisdom will reward you; if you are a mocker, you alone will suffer.*
*Proverbs 9:10-12 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.9.10-12.NIV*

I need to check myself thoroughly to see if I am a mocker or a wise person. For often I find myself alone. Not suffering, because anything negative I see as a way to learn from to get closer to God.

*Folly is an unruly woman; she is simple and knows nothing.*

It is as if two women are fighting for men, giving arguments and trying to get them to their houses. But a third woman, who represents folly, appears and does not even use logical arguments. She is saying stolen things taste better. What sense does that make?

*She sits at the door of her house, on a seat at the highest point of the city,*
*calling out to those who pass by, who go straight on their way,*
*“Let all who are simple come to my house!” To those who have no sense she says,*
*“Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is delicious!” But little do they know that the dead are there, that her guests are deep in the realm of the dead.*
*Proverbs 9:13-18 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.9.13-18.NIV*
If I understand this part correctly, it says that the ones who are seduced into the house of the folly, are not aware that the dead are in there. So how much can we contribute this foolishness to their own actions? Still, quite a lot I think, but not everything. It is true that the foolish people are not aware of every negative consequence, for if they knew, they would certainly have chosen a different path. In that sense, they are not foolish anymore because by definition a fool does not know very much.
But the foolish should know that wisdom is right. Wisdom is always right, and even though it is not always clear, in most cases they should see it and feel it, because wisdom is so logical and intuitive.
