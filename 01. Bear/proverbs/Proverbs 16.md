# Proverbs 16
*To humans belong the plans of the heart, but from the Lord comes the proper answer of the tongue.*
 
 
We can have plans all we want, but the Lord has the right answer. In this case plans does not refer to future plans, but to intentions, I think. And though we have good intentions, what we say is not always the right thing for the other. But the Lord has the right answer and if we say the right thing, it is from the Lord.
 
 
*All a person’s ways seem pure to them, but motives are weighed by the Lord .*
 
 
Lord of the You know my real motives, what good and bad thoughts I have about others and which part of me is real. I do not even know what I really want or what I really like. Do I really like wine or do I just fancy being fancy?
 
 
*Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans.*
 
 
What I need to do is stop thinking about plans that will make me rich, stop thinking about what God's plan is for me and what I should be doing, but start giving whatever I do to God. As long as I do it for God, He will establish my plans, which are actually His plans.
 
 
*The Lord works out everything to its proper end— even the wicked for a day of disaster.*
 
 
I do not really understand what this verse means. I understand what it means to work out a plan, but how is it possible to work out the wicked?
Perhaps it means that God has included the wicked as instruments in a day of disaster. So in working out his plan, God includes the good and the bad factors.
 
 
*The Lord detests all the proud of heart. Be sure of this: They will not go unpunished.*
*Proverbs 16:1‭-‬5 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.16.1-5.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.16.1-5.NIV)*
 
 
Lord, help me to not become proud. I must always know that You are better than I am at everything. Everything I have, is because of You. You are the One Who has given me everything and You have given it to me to serve You.

*Through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for; through the fear of the Lord evil is avoided.*
 
The atonement for sin does not need to happen through animal sacrifices. It is sacrificing oneself that the Lord cares about. And if one cares about his animals, he should sacrifice those. But shamefulness and time are costly features, and by giving those, by loving others and showing faithfulness to God and man alike, God will accept that as an atonement.

The same goes for evil. If you want to stay far away from it, then stay close to God.

*When the Lord takes pleasure in anyone’s way, he causes their enemies to make peace with them.*
 
 
Do those things that will please the Lord. That is all. The Lord will take care of the rest.
 
 
*Better a little with righteousness than much gain with injustice.*
 
 
In other words, have nothing to do with what is illegal and unjust. Be satisfied with what you have, even if it is only a little. As long as it is righteous, God will accept that.

*In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps.*
 
 
The course of everything, our education and career, our plans for a family and purpose to fulfill our dream, and our living and holiday plans, all are set by God. Sometimes God gives us some freedom in a certain plan, but even then he establishes every step. Every step of the way we have walked, God has made possible.
Everything, and I really mean everything, of the preparation for the summer conference is made possible by God. We could not even have a location if it were not for Him.
But aall the simple steps as well. We might not even be able to rent a van. Who knows whether there are vans available?
 
 
*The lips of a king speak as an oracle, and his mouth does not betray justice.*
 
 
When a king speaks, and it is not for his own benefit, what he says is right. A wise king will have the best for his people and is not afraid to punish a criminal.
 
 
*Honest scales and balances belong to the Lord ; all the weights in the bag are of his making.*
*Proverbs 16:6‭-‬11 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.16.6-11.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.16.6-11.NIV)*
 
 
Everything that is honest comes from God alone. In us there is nothing honest. Some people are born with more honesty than others, but that honesty as well is from God alone.
Everything we can think of to create honesty are inspired from God. From weights to measure precious metals, to security in digital transactions, everything is meant to give God credit for righteousness and honesty.
Is there anything or anyone more honest than He Who openly announced the death of many a people by means of a flood, of people whom He loved, while knowing the world would later on mark Him a hypocrite for that?
Would a god so honest, do something so dishonest to His Son by letting Him die on this filthy world for us? Yes, because it is His and His Son's own choice.

*Kings detest wrongdoing, for a throne is established through righteousness.*
 
 
I think God is writing here about righteous kings for most certainly this does not apply for kings in these age or in the time if Solomon. Rather yet, a king was appointed as heir by the father, so I would not even speak of establishment.
But in the case of God, we know that He has established His kingdom and made Himself King of this world, because He is!
The meaning of these verses probably is to have respect for our king. If we look at our perfect King, we know that everything He likes and detests, and everything He says, is for a good and righteous reason.
Another reason for mentioning a king is that people had the utmost respect for and obedience to a king. If that can convince people to listen to the wisdom in these Proverbs, then let it be a king to give the example.
 
*Kings take pleasure in honest lips; they value the one who speaks what is right.*
 
 
The King wants us to be honest. If we want to be valued, we have to be honest. If we want people to like us, not for our outer appearance, but for who we are, we need to show them our value.
 
 
*A king’s wrath is a messenger of death, but the wise will appease it.*
 
 
A king may be a wise person, but at the same time he has authority as well. So remember that when someone speaks to you, and even though it is not the king himself, but when he speaks with you with wisdom from God, then he will have the authority given by God as well and though wrath will not come from him, it will come from the Lord Himself.
If you are wise, however, you will appease the execution. Plead with God for mercy and forgiveness, mourn and change your ways.
 
 
*When a king’s face brightens, it means life; his favor is like a rain cloud in spring.*
 
 
Father, when you are happy You give life. Not breathing, for that alone is not life, but life as You have intended it. You give me (and the world) joy, peace and love, but foremost hope. Through You I have hope for a better future, for my child as well and for my congregation.
 
 
*How much better to get wisdom than gold, to get insight rather than silver!*
 
 
All this time I have been neglecting the worth and value of wisdom. Of course I have “always” known that money is not the most important thing in this life, but I have estimated the value of wisdom and insight as too low. It is much higher than gold!
What I did was decreasing the value of gold until it was low enough, but that is not correct. The value of gold should not be decreased until it is lower than that of wisdom, but given the right value of gold, the value of wisdom should increase and definitely be higher than that of gold.
 
 
*The highway of the upright avoids evil; those who guard their ways preserve their lives.*

Perhaps I am mistaken, but it seems this is the first verse about wise people alone. No distinction is made between the wise and the foolish or the righteous and the wicked.
Being upright avoids evil and if you have good ways in living, and guard these, your life will be preserved.
Sometimes doing the right thing is as easy as that. When you do good, just keep on doing good. Of you just stay upright, then you will avoid evil. Evil might come to you, but it will not cross your path Jin a certain sense.
 
 
*Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.*
 
 
Lord, please let me not fall again into this pitfall of pride. I need your help. To avoid falling deeper I probably need to fall a little. Let me know what my limits are, let me make use of others. Let me not look down on the skills of my brothers and sisters.
 
 
*Better to be lowly in spirit along with the oppressed than to share plunder with the proud.*

*Proverbs 16:12‭-‬19 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.16.12-19.NIV*

Let me realize, Lord, that it is even better to be lowly in spirit and on the oppressed side. I cannot give it better wording than Solomon has. Let me not go for the loot, the quick money. Make me work hard for my money and success, while always giving You all the credits.

*Whoever gives heed to instruction prospers, and blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord .*
 
 
It's worth so much to listen to the Lord or to those words that are from the Lord. Prosperity will surely happen, though it might not come in ways expected.
In my case I listened to advice, or better said, I took the attitude of listening to others and by taking this attitude God spoke to me that words of advice.
It means standing open for God's advice, no matter who presents it and being humble in my own heart, because God prefers speaking to a broken heart.
 
 
*The wise in heart are called discerning, and gracious words promote instruction.*
 
 
Lord, You have shown me things I never knew, simple things everyone should know. You have shown me this week what it means to follow You. I have not learned completely, but I know it involves saying an immediate *yes* and it means I should not covet.
An often overlooked command, but still as great as the command of adultery and murder. And I do it quite more often than the other commands.
Also, I have to tremble before You, what does that mean? I have to look You up in everything, always look for You.
Bring glory to You, always, with everything we do, that is what You deserve.
 
 
*Prudence is a fountain of life to the prudent, but folly brings punishment to fools.*
 
 
 
 
*The hearts of the wise make their mouths prudent, and their lips promote instruction.*
 
 
If my heart is wise, I will do anything to make my body appear as wise from the outside as well. I will be wise in what I say to others, and what I say to others will promote instruction, teaching others what wisdom is.
 
 
*Gracious words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.*
 
 
Is there something that is healthy and good to eat? Yes, honey for example, and it has a healing effect as well.
And so it is with the Word of God, it is good, and it is always true. It is healthy for our bodies, say, psychologically and mentally giving us peace, but for the soul as well, giving us eternal rest if we obey it.
Obeying it of course to follow it completely, and accepting Jesus as our Savior as well.
 
 
*There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end it leads to death.*
 
 
We should carefully read this verse for many things we do appear to be right, but are not so in the end. How then can we distinguish between these? In the end they lead to death. This does not mean that only in the end it can be seen that this thing is bad. Rather yet, God shows us from the very beginning, even before we start undertaking something what is good and what is not.
If we cannot even believe and obey that, then the fruit of our choices will show up in a later stadium.
 
 
*The appetite of laborers works for them; their hunger drives them on.*
 
 
What is driving a person? In the case of a laborer it is his appetite, for he knows that he will not have dinner if there is no money on the table.
In the same way we must be driven by our passion for God's children for God wants us to love them. We must work and continue working for if we do not work, even though every person's final destination is in God's hands, we miss out on the chance to serve God in our life time.
Note that it is not God who misses out on an opportunity to let some people be converted. No, God has His own ways if man is not able or willing. It is *we* who are missing out on things. 
 
 
*A scoundrel plots evil, and on their lips it is like a scorching fire.*
 
 
When someone plots evil it is like something contagious, you want to join in, or you are thinking the same about someone else because you want to take revenge in a person because revenge is so sweet.
*But just like a scorching fire it eats up everything around him* and there is no control over this fire. In the beginning it might have been extinguished but later on it grows bigger than all of us can handle, and with us I mean humans. Only God can control it. 
As we can see from forest fires man cannot stop this, only nature can.

*A perverse person stirs up conflict, and a gossip separates close friends.*
 
 
Beware of the power of words, they can destroy even the best of relationships. Actually, facts can break these, but with words one can make lies sound like facts.
Gossiping too is like a scorching fire you do not know where it ends, who has heard it and there is no way to control it. The impacts can be life long and irreparable.
 
 
*A violent person entices their neighbor and leads them down a path that is not good.*
 
 
Just like two verses before violence is deemed contagious. No country I have seen in history automatically changes its violent behavior until all are subdued. Violence stirs up violence from others, even "the good guys" use violence to stop the bad guys from using it.
People in general are inclined to use violence because that is the easiest way. However, it is also the fastest way to go wrong. Accidents might happen, and when one finds out he is very good at it, it might be sort of addicting and one will then always resort to this measure.
 
 
*Whoever winks with their eye is plotting perversity; whoever purses their lips is bent on evil.*
 
 
God teaches us that the act is not the whole sin, even the thought of it is sin. Even before you have done anything, but merely winked your eye at a good idea, even then God deems that as plotting perversity.
Even before you say something and want to say something bad, the moment you purse your lips, that is sin.

*Gray hair is a crown of splendor; it is attained in the way of righteousness.*
 
 
Do not look down on people who are old, for theiry
hair is a sign of many experiences and wisdom and knowledge. Even if they have not lived like it, usually they know what is wrong for they have seen or heard about the consequences with their own eyes and ears.
 
 
*Better a patient person than a warrior, one with self-control than one who takes a city.*
 
 
Look for the most important characteristics and usually, if not always, they are on the inside.
No matter how big or of how much importance a trait may seem, do not be taken in by that.
 
 
*The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord .*
*Proverbs 16:20‭-‬33 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.16.20-33.NIV*

God can choose a person, a person be chosen and even become a king, but it is still God Who decides what happens from that moment on.
