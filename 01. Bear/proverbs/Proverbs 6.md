# Proverbs 6
*My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger,*
*you have been trapped by what you said, ensnared by the words of your mouth.*

Putting up security, or standing warrent for someone you do not know, is like putting your life in someone's hands. You cannot do that if you do not know this person!

*So do this, my son, to free yourself, since you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands: Go—to the point of exhaustion— and give your neighbor no rest!*

Give your neighbor no rest in whatever you are standing warrent for, and give yourself no rest as well.
For as long as you are not doing so, he can make use of you, and things might aggravate to extensive limits.

*Allow no sleep to your eyes, no slumber to your eyelids.*
*Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.*
*Proverbs 6:1-5 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.6.1-5.NIV*

The most important thing is to free myself from anything that is snatching me, because that is withholding me from serving God.

*Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise! It has no commander, no overseer or ruler, yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest.*

I must learn from the ant, without anyone to steer or rule them, he knows how to save for bad times to come.
This is different from the man who saved just to amass more and have bigger storage rooms. He had no purpose and he thought he would have a long life.
Save for a purpose, a short term purpose, and always rely on God for what is to come.

*How long will you lie there, you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep?*
*A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest— and poverty will come on you like a thief and scarcity like an armed man.*
*Proverbs 6:6-11 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.6.6-11.NIV*

Sloth or laziness is a very bad trait and will lead to poverty, materials poverty or spiritual poverty.
Lord, please help those in my church who are lazy to become like the ant, and know that what they are preparing for, not for winter, but for a spiritual war with Satan.

In Dutch this is translated as follows.

*Zo zal uw armoede u overkomen als een wandelaar, en uw gebrek als een gewapend man.*

I still do not understand what scarcity has to do with a weaponed man. I understand that thiefs come out of the unexpected, and so sloths will get poor unexpectedly. But do weaponed men get scarcity unexpectedly as well?

In the Chinese CUV translation it is paraphrased as I expected, namely

你的貧窮就必如強盜速來， 你的缺乏彷彿拿兵器的人來到。
箴言 6:11 CUNP-上帝
http://bible.com/414/pro.6.11.CUNP-上帝

It says that scarcity will come upon us like a weaponed man will, that man being a robber, I assume, and a thief as well. So the scarcity does not overcome the weaponed man, but us.

Lord, help me to be awake all the time. I feel like I am on a downward slope, having less time to read in Your Word and in Christian books, having less time for my family because of this job and because of my deaconship. Please help me to know my priorities. Help me to wake up earlier, put my job aside when I must, plan better, and not push processes too hard in church.

*Een Belialsmens, een ondeugdzaam man gaat met verkeerdheid des monds om;*
*Spreuken 6:11-12 SV1750*
*http://bible.com/165/pro.6.11-12.SV1750*

TODO OPZOEKEN
Belialsmens

*A troublemaker and a villain, who goes about with a corrupt mouth,*
*who winks maliciously with his eye, signals with his feet and motions with his fingers,*
*who plots evil with deceit in his heart— he always stirs up conflict.*

A son of Belial is something much worse than just a troublemaker or a villain, it is a son of the devil, in the sense that he is ruled and satiated by him.
This verse already explains that every part of his body is sinful. The next verse explains how every part of a body can be hateful and the person as a whole be detestable.
But this person is planning all the time, giving secret signals to work out his plan. Living a double life, and all to stir up a conflict.

*Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant; he will suddenly be destroyed—without remedy.*
*Proverbs 6:12-15 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.6.12-15.NIV*

And stirring up he will, but being stirred up he will be as well. Lord, thank You for Your grace having prevented this for me. It surely has happened, but You have given me so much strength and peace, that I have passed through this phase with ease. You have not destroyed me, though You had all right to do that.
At the same time I know this is a promise to those who are stirring up conflict, destroyed they will be, unless You provide them Your grace.

*16 There are six things the Lord hates,*
*seven that are detestable to him:*
*17 haughty eyes,*
*a lying tongue,*
*hands that shed innocent blood,*
*18 a heart that devises wicked schemes,*
*feet that are quick to rush into evil,*
*19 a false witness who pours out lies*
*and a person who stirs up conflict in the community.*

I have to be really careful here, careful of what is written here to see if I really understand, carefully examining myself to see if I am guilty of these things, and careful not to these detestable things again.

The first question is, *what does God not hate but detest? Or is it just a saying?* If I have to think of an answer, it would be the person. He hates the actions of persons, but not persons themselves.

The second question is, *am I guilty of these things?* Let me go through them one by one.
***Haughty eyes.*** Definitely. I look down upon others, thinking I am better. I look down upon issues, thinking I can handle them. I look down at my past, thinking I have been able to manage it all, while all the time none of it I have managed by myself, but by God's power alone. Not partially by God and partially by me, but by God alone.
***A lying tongue.*** Definitely, in the past and in the present. Even in the short periods that I was not lying, I still was in a different way. Supposedly liking people, being kind and friendly. Not submitting myself to the authority of the church and of the state, but acting as if I was. Being hypocritical about my life.
I always thought I was clean of this sin, but now that I think about it, I have been doing it all the time.
***Hands that shed innocent blood.*** Not literally I have done this, but taking away the innocence of some is perhaps equally shameful and detestable.
***A heart that devises wicked schemes*** **.** Schemes I have devised for sure, schemes to not submit to the church's authority. Wicked schemes - I wanted to say *no*, but alas the answer is - yes, that too, to fool others into believing I am pure and holy.
****Feet that are quick to rush into evil**** ***.*** This I have proven most recently, rushing without thinking about the consequences, without thinking about other people's feelings, without thinking about the image I have given of God.
***a false witness who pours out lies.*** I am not sure yet what the difference is between a lying tongue and a false witness. I suppose a lying tongue is for oneself, while a false witness is to bring harm to someone, or to protect someone else. My mind is not clear at the moment, but I strongly urge to say I have sinned. I protect my wife, and myself most of all. I tell what I see, and what I want people to see, while not telling the full truth. 
***a person who stirs up conflict in the community.*** Most certainly the whole church would say I am guilty of this trait. I am not afraid to say what’s on my mind, to wait for the right moment or to walk up to anyone regardless of the position he holds. I have gone into many conflicts with my wife and with other brothers (and perhaps sisters) because of this, because of my disrespect for certain people. 
Even if they deserve it, even if they are wrong or do not deserve to be treated like kings, just because of their status in church, still I do not have the right — or better said, had better not — talked to them in the way I did, causing them to either lose face or bringing shame upon him.

***Warning Against Adultery***
*20 My son, keep your father’s command*
*and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.*
*21 Bind them always on your heart;*
*fasten them around your neck.*
*22 When you walk, they will guide you;*
*when you sleep, they will watch over you;*
*when you awake, they will speak to you.*
*23 For this command is a lamp,*
*this teaching is a light,*
*and correction and instruction*
*are the way to life,*
*24 keeping you from your neighbor’s wife,*
*from the smooth talk of a wayward woman.*

What is very important about this part is the last verse. All of the wise lessons in the previous verses are meant to keep the last rule of adultery. This is so important that Solomon dedicates the rest of this proverb to it, and perhaps even more of the other proverbs.
There is a reason why it takes us 18 years before we become an adult and that is because we have so much to learn and for things to become habits.
It takes time to take one’s parents’ wisdom and let it become the first thing on your mind, during the day and even in your sleep. As a matter of fact, I have had dreams where I did some bad things and even in my dreams my conscientiousness was accusing me.
One needs to realize this is a … learning process.

*Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes.*

Men are always so easily captivated by beauty. Not even because it is rare, for there are many beautiful women in all countries. It is because we, men, lusted for something like that for a long time already, and the devil only uses that to tempt us.

*For a prostitute can be had for a loaf of bread, but another man’s wife preys on your very life. Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?*
*Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched?*
*So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.*
*Proverbs 6:25-29 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.6.25-29.NIV*

Sleeping with another man's wife is a whole other story. Sleeping with a prostitute would mean you are but satisfying yourself, and not thinking about the woman's feelings or position.
But adultery would mean you are breaking the bond between two people, that God has united. You are causing a conflict in their respective families.
You will also cause both of them and yourself to lose face and be despised.

*People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving.*
*Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him all the wealth of his house. But a man who commits adultery has no sense; whoever does so destroys himself.*
*Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his shame will never be wiped away.*
*Proverbs 6:30-33 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.6.30-33.NIV*

The consequences are huge for both parties. A man in need steals, but what rationale does he have who commits adultery? It us merely a temporary last that must be satiated. Temporary in the sense that it has no longer term effect. Your lust is gone for a short period, but then it will grow back again to even bigger formats. And you have lost money on a prostitute, and your morals and reputation as well when adultering.

Yes, he will surely destroy himself. What I wrote is about the current situation, but crossing this line will open ways to new sins. The devil will use your comfortability with this area to explore new ones, or use it to bring guilt and shame upon you.
Your lust will be ever increasing and that of the woman as well, now that she has crossed that line.

*For jealousy arouses a husband’s fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.*
*He will not accept any compensation; he will refuse a bribe, however great it is.*
*Proverbs 6:34-35 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.6.34-35.NIV*

A man who truly loves his wife, or just one who really cares about his reputation, can never just let go of a case of adultery. Even when he does not care about his wife he would still be furious about someone taking something that belongs to him.

TODO write book named *On adultery in and outside of movies (* or *in movies* and real life) on adultery and the phenomenon that when as soon as a woman has had sex with her first one, she more easily sleeps with others. 

Seen from exs' experience, but also in movies, which depict a core of truth.
