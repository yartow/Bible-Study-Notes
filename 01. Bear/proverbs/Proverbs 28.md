# Proverbs 28
*The wicked flee though no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.*
 
 
If you are bad, your conscience will tell you. If your conscience is good, you will hear it all the time. That is why the wicked flee, because they keep hearing God's judgement.
The righteous are not bold because of their strength, but because of God's strength, which is with them because they are righteous.
So would I rather be strong or weak? That is not the right question. The question is how do I become strong? And the answer is, *you will not, but God's strength is there for you if you are righteous.* 
 
*When a country is rebellious, it has many rulers, but a ruler with discernment and knowledge maintains order.*
 
 
More rulers does not mean that a country is better controlled, rather yet it is usually the opposite.
Perhaps one might think it is not *controlled* better but at least the country is more *balanced* because there are in fact several people who form a board with aivariety of opinions. 
That may be, but it could also be that all of them are dictators and slave drivers.
However, that is not the statement here. The statement is that rebellious countries have many rulers. The question to me is what the definition is of rebel, because Liberia has a lot of war, but only one ruler.
But as for Iraq there is a clear case of multiple leaders of multiple peoples. So not multiple leaders working together as one, but against each other.

To get a country to fare well, it requires more than just one ruler though, it requires him to be discern, which means he must be able to see what is actually going on in his country, and knowledgeable, knowing that to do about it.
These two things cannot go apart. Wisdom is know what to do, but you cannot know what to do if you do not know what is going on.
 
 
*A ruler who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no crops.*
 
 
The whole reason for a ruler is so that the people are being taken care of and ideally, being led by good example as well, so that they may be led to God.
As for the latter, we see the reality of this in the history of Israel 🇮🇱 .
If a ruler oppresses his people then why is there a ruler at all? In the beginning of course this is because he can benefit from the harvest that the previous ruler has left. He benefits from taxes, and thus wealth, and being served by the people.
If the people, however, are unable to make any money because of the ruler's incompetence of taking care of the people, he himself will not even be able to eat for where would the food or money come from? A whole nation is deemed and doomed to die and the people would have been better off without him.

*Those who forsake instruction praise the wicked, but those who heed it resist them.*

*Proverbs 28:1‭-‬4 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.28.1-4.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.28.1-4.NIV)*
 
 
It is so striking to see that what is happening in the world right now is exactly what the Bible describes.
The ones in the world right now who are praising the wicked, like Bill Ayers, Richard Dawkins and other liberals and evolutionists such as Christopher Hitchens are homosexuals, and not pro life. They are the ones who forsook God's instructions.

*Evildoers do not understand what is right, but those who seek the Lord understand it fully.*
 
 
Understanding what is right is the first step in finding God. Doing it is another step.
It is of importance to know how to fully understand what is right, and one can reach that by honestly seeking the Lord.
The worst kind of evildoers is those who think they know what is right. There are those who know that what they do, is wrong. Plain criminals commit crimes for a very logical reason, such as lust or hatred. But more complex crimes are often done by people who think that what they do is right for the people. I think even Hitler was one of those.
 
 
*Better the poor whose walk is blameless than the rich whose ways are perverse.*
 
 
Should I ever choose someone for a task of honor, I would choose a poor person whose walk is blameless over a rich person whose ways are perverse.
It comes to mind that a rich person might be more effective, for probably he has studied more and has more money to help me in reaching my goal, but no matter how much money he is willing to give, I can never reach a purpose of God with it because God's purpose is always obtained by honest people who are not longing for money.
 
 
*A discerning son heeds instruction, but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father.*
 
 
In this verse the motivation for heeding instructions is by correlating it with the position a son has to his father. This is something from all ages: a son wanting to make his father proud. This is how God wired us, in order to make Him proud.
 
 
*Whoever increases wealth by taking interest or profit from the poor amasses it for another, who will be kind to the poor.*
 
 
Capitalism is what many liberals and Democrats – and communists as well – deem as taking money from the poor to become rich yourself. If that is true then it is the capitalists who will suffer most from the consequences, according to this verse.
In any case, let this be a warning for me to never become rich on the back of others, especially not the poor.
 
 
*If anyone turns a deaf ear to my instruction, even their prayers are detestable.*
*Proverbs 28:5‭-‬9 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.28.5-9.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.28.5-9.NIV)*

God has feelings, He can be hurt too. Why should He listen to you if you do not even listen to Him or His instructions?
It is the same as what we feel when others hurt us. God feels that as well, although I do not know His exact feelings of resentment, because ours of course are blotted with human sin.
Note that this is referring to a *deaf ear*, I think, as in not even bothering to listen to God's instructions anymore. This refers to someone not even willing to consider whether to listen to God's Word. 

*Proverbs 28:10-15 (NIV)*
*10 Whoever leads the upright along an evil path*
*will fall into their own trap,*
*but the blameless will receive a good inheritance.*
 
 
It is possible to lead the wicked along an evil path, this verse does not say anything about that, although Jesus does say that we should love our enemies.
In any case, leading the upright along an evil path would surely be seen as sin and the consequence of that is that those who do so will fall into their own trap.
 
 
*11 The rich are wise in their own eyes;*
*one who is poor and discerning sees how deluded they are.*
 
 
 
I can imagine that the rich are not able to see real wisdom anymore, being blinded by their richness. Just like adults cannot really see how children feel, the rich cannot really remember what is to be poor, if they even have been poor at one time.
The poor on the other hand see how the rich are deluded.
 
 
*12 When the righteous triumph, there is great elation;*
*but when the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding.*
 
 
Though this verse says so, we saw the nation of the United States going into great elation and with Trump people, sometimes literally, going into hiding by moving to other countries.
I believe this verse is true, but I also believe that elation depends on the people. In the case of the Golden Calf in the Sinai desert, the people were elated as well.
 
 
*13 Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper,*
*but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy.*
 
 
As God has always taught, it is through confessing that we can heal and renouncing them that we can find mercy. Yes, mercy and grace are given for free, it is in the definition of the words, but still they require our change of attitude and action on our side beforehand.
 
 
*14 Blessed is the one who always trembles before God,*
*but whoever hardens their heart falls into trouble.*
 
 
It is better to be afraid of God than to not feel anything from God. I think that in the latter case you will not feel anything *for* God either. 
Especially in difficult times, when we are in trouble, that is when we need God most. But if you do not have God in those moments you are, so to speak, in double trouble.
 
 
*15 Like a roaring lion or a charging bear*
*is a wicked ruler over a helpless people.*
 

A wicked ruler makes everyone afraid and strikes everyone down in his vicinity, right or wrong.
But this verse is a combination of two parties, a wicked ruler and a helpless people. For a people that is not helpless would perhaps resent this ruler. But the combination of both has bigger catastrophies.

*Proverbs 28:16-28 (NIV)*
*16 A tyrannical ruler practices extortion,*
*but one who hates ill-gotten gain will enjoy a long reign.*
 
 
I need to hate ill-gotten gain. Extortion and other ways to get money over other people's backs I need to hate and never consider in order to get reign.
Usually in stories though, the one who hates ill-gotten gain is the who becomes king eventually, but he needs to wait a long time as well, and so when he gets to become a king, he is already old and not many years of reign are left.
 
 
*17 Anyone tormented by the guilt of murder*
*will seek refuge in the grave;*
*let no one hold them back.*
 
 
Killing someone, at least for the first time, is not that easy. From what I have read people actually vomit upon seeing a living person die in front of their eyes. From what I have seen people have become traumatized after the Vietnam War, remember all the people they've killed.
The guilt of killing people, especially innocent ones, and not being able to escape from it, will make them consider suicide.
I am not sure if the last line "let no one hold them back" should be interpreted as allowing such people to die.
 
 
*18 The one whose walk is blameless is kept safe,*
*but the one whose ways are perverse will fall into the pit.*
 
 
The perverse ones will always have to watch their backs, seeing if anyone is following them or persecuting them their crimes. Eventually though, they will be caught, either by justice or by their conscience.
The ones on the safe side, though they might feel like nothing exciting is happening in their lives, will be grateful in hindsight for the peace they have experienced of not having to look over their shoulders and not ending in the pit.

*19 Those who work their land will have abundant food,*
*but those who chase fantasies will have their fill of poverty.*
 
 
The same goes for those who work hard. It might feel for them as if they are missing out on all the fun, but they will see that they will be rewarded with a harvest whole others will suffer the consequences of their own actions.
 
 
*20 A faithful person will be richly blessed,*
*but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished.*
 
 
I need to be careful with my eagerness. Even though I had no intention of walking over other people's backs, it is still a warning for me not to be eager to get rich.
For what reason does man want to be rich? Is it not to get rid of the dependence on God and to do as one pleases? To buy what he wants, whenever it suits him and discard the virtues of patience and endurance?
No, in richness lies the deceit of being blessed, while the real blessing lies in being faithful.
 
 
*21 To show partiality is not good—*
*yet a person will do wrong for a piece of bread.*
 
 
It feels like I have read this verse before, but then again a lot of Proverbs are repeated, either because of multiple authors or because of the importance of it.
What exactly is the relationship between partiality and doing wrong?
The meaning here is that even though we humans say that doing something wrong is not good, we still do it, for something as little as a piece of bread.
So how strong are we in our convictions?
 
 
*22 The stingy are eager to get rich*
*and are unaware that poverty awaits them.*
 
 
Once again eagerness to get rich is a bad trait. Even if it is to be of more help to others. First off, if you give you money to others, you will not be rich anymore and you will never get rich. Secondly, richness provides a security, even if you do not bathe in luxury one still desires to be rich because he has a place to live and a steady income.
I know many if not all Christians desire the latter, it is only basic human desires to long for security, but the Son of Man does not have a place to stay, and so we should actually desire that.
 
 
*23 Whoever rebukes a person will in the end gain favor*
*rather than one who has a flattering tongue.*
 
 
This is what I hope for, that in the end people will recognize my intentions. It is not long, if God wills, before I will leave my current congregation, but at this moment my rebuke is not appreciated upon.
Both by the pastor and the elders this was not done, except for me, nor was it appreciated amongst most of the members when I did it.
We will see what happens in the end. For now this verse will give me comfort.
 
 
*24 Whoever robs their father or mother*
*and says, “It’s not wrong,”*
*is partner to one who destroys.*
 
 
Parents are willing to give everything for their children, but that does not mean that children can take everything they want from their parents.
Such children are spoiled and have lost respect for their parents and destroy the relationship with their parents.
 
 
*25 The greedy stir up conflict,*
*but those who trust in the Lord will prosper.*
 
 
In this verse a disparity is made between the greedy and those who trust in the Lord. Though they are not opposites of each other they are two mutually exclusive traits not found in the same person who
For how can a person trust in the Lord and still be greedy? Then either he is lying about his trust in the Lord or in his greed.
For greed is wanting more when we have enough already, while trust in the Lord should provide us with more than enough faith in our circumstances.
 
 
*26 Those who trust in themselves are fools,*
*but those who walk in wisdom are kept safe.*
 
 
This too, like he verse before, means that those who walk in wisdom do not trust in themselves.
It is quite often if not always the opposition of what the world tells you how to live, which will actually save you. The world tells us we need to trust ourselves and have faith in ourselves, but the Bible tells us to trust God and have faith in Him.
Rather yet, those who trust in themselves are fools. They do not know of a higher power. While it is only logical that one cannot lift oneself up. It always requires another person who is stronger.
 
 
*27 Those who give to the poor will lack nothing,*
*but those who close their eyes to them receive many curses.*
 
 
 
I was confused when reading this because the Dutch version has
Als je arme mensen geld geeft, zul je het altijd goed hebben (BGT)

as the translation of the first line, which means something like someone will always have good things. But the English version, and probably the original text as well, says that they will "lack nothing", which is something completely different.
Those who give to the poor might not become rich, but they will always have enough.
But while it is not certain what you will receive when you give to the poor, it is most certain that if you do not give to them, consciously ignoring them, you will receive many curses.
 
 
*28 When the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding;*
*but when the wicked perish, the righteous thrive.*
 

Here too, this could be a statement about Trump. But this is valid only when people know that someone is wicked. For if Hillary Clinton had come to power, no one would have hidden because they do not know that she is wicked.
But one thing is sure, when the wicked perish, whether known or not, the righteous will not suffer from the wicked's power anymore and they will thrive.
There is still a long way to come before this will take place. I pray that the Lord is present in the Netherlands to form the government.
