# Proverbs 20:1
*Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler; whoever is led astray by them is not wise.*
*Proverbs 20:1 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.20.1.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.20.1.NIV)*

Just right now, when I had too much to drink last night, my eyes come across this verse.
A few days ago I was writing about this verse about others that are *led* by alcohol. Now I am writing this about myself, not being led by it or basing my decisions off it, but my being led *astray.*
Whoever is led astray by alcohol is not wise. Yes, that is me, it is written about me, at this very moment.
I have not been very wise, not giving my wife a call to say where I was, and that should be done even before I was led astray.
