# Proverbs 18
*An unfriendly person pursues selfish ends and against all sound judgment starts quarrels.*
 
 
When I want something so bad, and when I want it for myself, I will usually stop at nothing. This is my selfish nature. Even if everything points to me being wrong, I will still go against it.
 
 
*Fools find no pleasure in understanding but delight in airing their own opinions.*
 
 
Yes, I have met these people who only talk but do not listen and they think they have all wisdom, based on their own experience or sources, but in fact only want to confirm what they believe already or is feasible within their mindset.

*When wickedness comes, so does contempt, and with shame comes reproach.*
 
 
When people become bad they start showing contempt for others, for those who have been bad to them for example, and those who have ashamed them. And this shame is bringing reproach.
This is not only a proverb of insight and understanding of the mind of the wicked, but also an advice to us, for if we shame people, this is what will become of them.
 
 
*The words of the mouth are deep waters, but the fountain of wisdom is a rushing stream.*
*Proverbs 18:1‭-‬4 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.18.1-4.NIV*

There may be many words of wisdom in our spoken words, but they would need to be found. In the many of our words, which words are wisdom, and which are not? Which words come from the Lord and which from ourselves?
But if these are words of wisdom from God, they are like a fountain which sprays it's water anywhere and cannot be stopped. So it is with the wisdom of God, once hearing it you will realize it is God, it is Him everywhere and you cannot stop wisdom and its effect.

*It is not good to be partial to the wicked and so deprive the innocent of justice.*
 
 
Though obvious, it is still practiced throughout the world even to this day and probably will be forever for as long as this world exists.
In the Third World countries this corruption exists in every level, mostly as a means to "survive" or have a "better" life, at least according to their own definition, because it provides money, though sometimes it is cultural, as in the case of religious persecution, where this corruption is hen fueled by hatred of other groups or also protection of oneself out of fear for the majority.
Oddly enough, in the West this partiality is mostly reserved to the highest levels, the richest people, where survival is no longer needed, but where the wicked have given themselves over to something called gluttony, greed and
TODO OPZOEKEN gulzigheid
gullibility, if you will. They have a lot, but they want more and in some sense they are addicted by what they strived for, be it money or power, and in some cases are indeed surviving, because of their lifestyle which has adapted to a certain cash flow which they cannot or are not willing to change anymore.
 
 
*The lips of fools bring them strife, and their mouths invite a beating.*
 
 
Not only for his image, but also for his safety a fool should keep his mouth shut. Sometimes we are the fool though, if we keep on talking in the wrong places. Even Jesus was silent at times when He thought was best.
But at certain moments, even when we are beaten, it does not mean we are foolish, because some need to hear the Word of God, even at the cost of our lives. Then what we do is not foolish, even if we do not know whether this person understands our words, but because we do it because God tells us to.
Be aware though that this is not applicable to every situation. Not in every situation is preaching the gospel a wise thing and when preaching one should always keep listening to God to see what God wants you to say, and whether He wants you to continue or stop speaking.
 
 
*The mouths of fools are their undoing, and their lips are a snare to their very lives.*
 
 
A wise person can make himself a fool by saying the wrong things and their lips are what ensnares them all their lives.
Some people stutter and never bring a message across, others never know how to speak with wisdom and bring many words across, but not their message. And one group curses itself by speaking, the fools, and they will cause their own destruction.
 
 
*The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to the inmost parts.*

*Proverbs 18:5‭-‬8 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.18.5-8.NIV*

Gossip indeed does not stop at the forehead, so to speak, it enters the deep thoughts and - unfortunately, long term - memory.
Therefore be careful with what you say, for you will not only hurt one or more persons, but hurt them for a long time.

*One who is slack in his work is brother to one who destroys.*
 
 
Laziness is never promoted, not by God and not by anyone. God takes it even one step further. The world might think that laziness has never hurt anyone, but God says that you are guilty of destruction if you slack in your work.
Look at buildings tumbling down because an architect or project manager slacked in his work, purposely or not, or crashing airplanes. Death is the consequence of slacking, if not yours then someone else's.
 
 
*The name of the Lord is a fortified tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.*
 
 
Whenever people get stressed they call out God's Name. This does not help them for they do not know what this Name means and all they are doing is indeed calling. They are not asking for Him, His Person to come and save them.
For those who do know Him, God is the Name above all names and asking Him for help means bringing down the armies of heaven to destroy the gates of hell.
If you know what this Name means, you will not simply let it get out of your mouth. People do not even misuse a fire alarm or emergency stop button, because that is punishable by law. Using God's Name for the wrong reason is punishable by His Law.
The difference, however, is that we can call to God for any valid reason, not only in emergencies.
 
 
*The wealth of the rich is their fortified city; they imagine it a wall too high to scale.*
 
 
The rich think they cannot be attacked and that with their money they can protect themselves. They will go for the best protection there exists in the world and think that their wall is unbreachable.
They do not realize that this protection is made by human beings and what is made by humans can be destroyed by humans.
If they think this wall is too high then this only makes me pity them, for they have seen nothing of Your height at all. You are towering over mountains and hold the seas in Your hands.
The rich are just too naive and unknowingly, yet not innocent.
But aside from richness, this applies to intellectuals as well, who have their own wall of rationality and reason. Little do they know about their world which fits reason is only part of a bigger world where only God's reason applies.
 
 
*Before a downfall the heart is haughty, but humility comes before honor.*

After this downfall, a heart may become humble and after humility comes honor. So do not think too bad of the downfall for it is that that has saved or will save your life.
 
 
*To answer before listening— that is folly and shame.*
*Proverbs 18:9‭-‬13 NIV*
*http://bible.com/111/pro.18.9-13.NIV*

You will do so much wrong when not listening. You will give wrong answers, you will ignore a person's questions and needs.

*The human spirit can endure in sickness, but a crushed spirit who can bear?*
 
 
As bad as one feels when he is sick, feeling heavy in one's head, having a running nose and no energy to stand up. Still it is worse to have a crushed spirit.
When a man has a crushed spirit it does not matter how strong and healthy his body is, for he has not the wilt move it.
 
 
*The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge, for the ears of the wise seek it out.*
 
 
Discerning people cannot love without knowledge, they need to know what the truth is. They will seek knowledge and listen, and if they are wise their ears listen to the right things.
 
 
*A gift opens the way and ushers the giver into the presence of the great.*
*Proverbs 18:14‭-‬16 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.18.14-16.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.18.14-16.NIV)*
 
 
God is not saying here that this only applies to people with the gift of giving or those who speak the love language of giving. No, it is for all and even more so for those who do not naturally give. The giver will be rewarded for giving a gift.
 
 
*In a lawsuit the first to speak seems right, until someone comes forward and cross-examines.*
 
 
I should not think that I am right. I may seem right, but I am the first to speak as well. Let someone else speak as well and see how my arguments stand before his.
I am confident of my statements, not only have I been confirmed in this by other opinions, but also by Francis Chan is his book *Crazy Love*. 
 
 
*Casting the lot settles disputes and keeps strong opponents apart.*
 
 
Sometimes when we are in a dispute, and we can not get to an agreement, we should just cast a lot, let chance decide what we are going to do. It does not mean the other person or I is wrong, but it does settle it. In this way no conflict occurs on our mutual side, which would otherwise leave a hole for the enemy to enter.
I am not sure what is meant by these *strong opponents* here. It could be the two of us – the other person and I on the good side – but it could also be the good and the bad side – where the bad side is our opponent of course. I have assumed the latter for this expository, but in case of the former it means that two strong opponents stay apart, that is not in a tug of war. 
If you hate someone, that is not what God wants, but it is better to keep this person then at a distance then to be in a fight with him. This could be one interpretation of this verse.
 
 
*A brother wronged is more unyielding than a fortified city; disputes are like the barred gates of a citadel.*
*Proverbs 18:17‭-‬19 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.18.17-19.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.18.17-19.NIV)*

If you have wronged your brother, for example you have accused him of something he did not do, or betrayed his trust, he will close down. Men are not like women who will openly tell you what they feel, they just shut up and refuse to talk.
If you are in a discussion with this brother, or you need to talk something through, this is bad, because a person in this situation will not disclose anything, not his thoughts or answers. It would be easier to get something out of a fortified city.
If you have a dispute with him he will close down even more. It is not the castle you have to breach then but the citadel with barred gates, which is even harder.

*From the fruit of their mouth a person’s stomach is filled; with the harvest of their lips they are satisfied.*
 
 
It is not that a person gets filled because of what he says, it is the other way around. I know that it is written here like this, but a thought starts in the heart and fills it up and then eventually one speaks it out.
The explanations beneath from different Bible commentaries are what I think are correct.

Assuming that the words a man speaks are good, he will benefit from it. So in this sense the consequences of his words will provide a harvest to him. See for example preachers.
The other commentary explains that the heart has been replaced by the stomach. Something should ideally satisfy your heart, not your stomach.
What we will our heart with, that will be what "satisfies" us, be it temporarily only. But now the heart has been replaced with the stomach, it is what is in the stomach that satisfies us, and the stomach contains not the things we really need, but merely the temporary and material things, such as food and money.

Waar het hart vol is etymology

Matthew Henry
The belly is here put for the heart, as elsewhere; and what that is filled with, our satisfaction will be accordingly, and our inward peace.

Jamieson Fausset Brown
20. (Compare Pr 12:14; 13:2). Men's words are the fruit, or, increase of his lips, and when good, benefit them.

 
 
*The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit.*
 
 
This verse could be interpreted for both people who use their tongue well and those who do not. And it is applicable to those who love their tongue and those who do not.
What is the case when you love your tongue? I would say that one would be careful of it, for if you use it wrongly someone might hurt it.
If you use it wisely there will be all kinds of fruit, in a good sense. It will be more life giving than destroying and that is the fruit you can reap.
 
 
*He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord .*
*Proverbs 18:20‭-‬22 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.18.20-22.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.18.20-22.NIV)*

The man who has a wife has something he did not have before, which is someone to correct him and who can see his faults. Receiving favor from the Lord is to become more like Him and a wife will make the man more like God for he will need to learn to love her, to be patient with her and to care for her.

*The poor plead for mercy, but the rich answer harshly.*
 
 
 
 
 
 
*One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.*
*Proverbs 18:23‭-‬24 NIV*
*[http://bible.com/111/pro.18.23-24.NIV](http://bible.com/111/pro.18.23-24.NIV)*

In other translations it seems to say, one who has many friends. Yes, too many friends will cause you ruin, because that would usually mean they are ll superficial friends. Instead, go for those friends who are real and stick closer than brothers.
Who is this friend? Jesus? It could be that the author had Him in mind.
