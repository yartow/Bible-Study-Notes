# Test First Notable Note
Let's see what this does

```katex

\int^{4}_0 
```

```latex 
\LaTeX \sum

```
$\sum$

```sql 
select * 
from AMS a 
where 1=1 
```
How about **bold** and ***nested bold***?

## List of things not working yet in Notable
* Unfortunately many shortcuts don't work, not even for mark-up
* No auto-bulleting
* `\LaTeX` doesn't work
* No in-line preview of nested fonts
