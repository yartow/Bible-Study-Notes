> *1 Thessalonians 1:9-10 (ESV) 9 For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, 10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.*  

What is this "wrath" that is to come? 
> (MacArthur Study Bible Notes, NKJV) The wrath can refer either to God’s temporal wrath to come on the earth (Rev. 6:16, 17; 19:15) or to God’s eternal wrath (John 3:36; Rom. 5:9, 10).  

**God's temporal wrath**
*Revelation 6:16-17 (ESV) 16 calling to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, 17 for the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand?”*

*Revelation 19:15 (ESV) 15 From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.*

**God's eternal wrath**
*John 3:36 (ESV) 36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.*

*Romans 5:9-10 (ESV) 9 Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. 10 For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.*

**Conclusion**
(MacArthur Study Bible Notes, NKJV) The emphasis in both passages on Christ’s work of salvation from sin favors this being understood as the deliverance from the eternal wrath of God in hell because of salvation.
