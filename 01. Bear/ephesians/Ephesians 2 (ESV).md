# Ephesians 2 (ESV) 
***By Grace Through Faith***
*1 And you were dead in the trespasses and sins 2 in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— 3 among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. 4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, 5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— 6 and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.*



*8 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, 9 not a result of works, so that no one may boast.*


*MacSBNnkjv* writes the following about the part **this is not your own doing**.
> (MacArthur Study Bible Notes, NKJV) 2:8 faith, and that not of yourselves. “That” refers to the entire previous statement of salvation, not only the grace but the faith. Although men are required to believe for salvation, even that faith is part of the gift of God which saves and cannot be exercised by one’s own power. God’s grace is preeminent in every aspect of salvation (cf. Rom. 3:20; Gal. 2:16).  

Another interpretation is that "this" only refers to the salvation and *not* to the part on faith. The argument of those who hold this view is a literary one, namely that based on grammar "this" could never refer to faith. Perhaps this is in the plural form or referring to a subject of a different gender than "faith" is. Also, they state that it does not make sense that only God can give people faith and that only through faith one obtains salvation, for then those who are not saved are only so because they did not receive faith in the first place, having nothing to do with free will, and those who are saved, are only saved because they obtained the will to follow God and the will to repent from sins, and faith to believe in Him, which also has nothing to do with free will then. 
The explanation they hold for their view is that God *hypothetically* evaluated each person's free choice of whether to choose God or not *before* the Creation, and imposed and implemented this *practically* after Creation. So in other words, each person is granted faith on the basis of whether he would have believed if he had free choice. If he would not #todo/opzoeken/engels , then in practice, after Creation, God destined this person to hell, by hardening his heart and consequently did not elect him for a relationship with Christ. 
My personal stance is that we cannot comprehend how free will and God's will c.q. plan work together. Yet, it is seen in the Bible that man has free will, that God is righteous and punishes on the basis of man's own choices, but it is also seen that God's will always prevail. These two things man cannot bring together, as James D. Kennedy #tags/famouspeople/christian concluded in his sermon on the free will of man, called *Does man have free will?*, yet both statements above are true, namely that man *does* have free will and that God's will always prevails. 

*10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.* #biblestudy/memorization/nathan/todo

***One in Christ***
*11 Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called “the uncircumcision” by what is called the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands— 12 remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. 14 For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility 15 by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace, 16 and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility. 17 And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near. 18 For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. 19 So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, 20 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, 21 in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. 22 In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.*
