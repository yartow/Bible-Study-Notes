#todo/opzoeken  15 years after Jesus died

*Galatians 1:1-9 (NIV) Paul, an apostle —sent not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead — 2 and all the brothers and sisters with me,*
*To the churches in Galatia:*
*3 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, 4 who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, 5 to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.*

**No Other Gospel**
*6 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel — 7 which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse! 9 As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!*

~1. How does the gospel bring us grace and peace?~ 
**Grace**
1. 

**Peace**
1. Peace because we can have assurance in our salvation
2. Peace because there is no enmity anymore

If there’s no grace without the law, grace does not mean anything, it’s cheap grace, because there’s no cost. 
Legalism and grace are two sides of the same coin. 

~2. Why is Paul so flabbergasted?~
Two possible answers:
1. The other gospel is clearly inferior
2. False teachers have come in so quickly

Judaizers := Jewish people who had become Christians but were still holding on to old … traditions. 

People who are Christians are not concerned with their sin.
They care about the consequences of sin. 
So the fact he’s concerned about it, is a good sign. 
He will need to be clear that he will never stop sinning. 
That is not your goal. Your goal is that you want to sin less. 

**Example.** A snake will continue to move for hours. #todo/opzoeken  snake head can still bite even after it's dead.

The Judaizers had anger and resentment
Paul said: We obey because we are loved.
But the Judaizers say, no, we obey and then we get loved. 

Since I’m in Christ, He can’t love me any more, because He loves Christ more than anything in the world. 

This doesn’t change how you stand for God.
It was like calm water over me.

*If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!*
If anyone is believing this other gospel, he will be accursed.

C.H. Spurgeon 
[>The Yellow Stripes Quote Spurgeon Never Said](https://gfmanchester.com/the-yellow-stripes-quote-spurgeon-never-said)

It pleases God to use people to bring them to Himself. 

We have free will, but we are not free from our nature. That’s what the Gospel frees us from, but we’re 


~3. Who are the Judaizers of today?~
Perhaps the very traditional churches, people who believe they deserve more. They do not believe or accept Gods grace.

## Background info
Galatia, in Turkey
Council, 48AD, refers to Paul having been there (in Galatia). The book was written shortly after. 
It’s a possible problem that he said: *Next time I write you letters I’m going to write it differently.*

The times when we were strongest in our struggles and in our ministry, we were attacked most. 
Satan doesn’t like it when the kingdom of God is advancing.
