Take a few minutes to think about this part

You can write down what you find special. Let us know which verse is special to you and why. 

Is there anyone who wants to share what he has written down? 

Verse 27. This means that if you love Jesus you also love God. This struck me, because it means you believe that Jesus is God. 

Her name is Esther. Doesn't this mean that you can pray to the Father Himself as well? 

Jure: the Father Himself loves you. The love from the Father has a condition though, which is that you need to love Jesus first, only then the Father will love you. 

Anyone else? 
Jürgen: I have a lot of questions. Why does the Lord still speak in images to His disciples? See verse 25. 
Jan: Maybe it is to test whether they have understood it. 
Andrew: I think that maybe his disciples cannot understand Jesus, that is why he has to use images or parables. 
Esther: But perhaps this is because they do not have the Holy Spirit yet, which can explain this to them. 

Jure: Luke 10:21 explains this. Jesus spoke in parables so that some would not understand. 
Jürgen: So was Jesus speaking in parables because perhaps Judas was there and He didn't want him to understand? 
Andrew: In v.25 Jesus says that He is speaking in images, but in verse 29 the disciples say they now understand because Jesus is not speaking in images anymore. How can this be? 

Wisam: It depends on the situation why Jesus would use images. But I do not know why Jesus would use images in this case. 

Jürgen: Isaiah spoke about images and that God uses those images because He didn't want people to understand it, because He didn't want certain people to come to faith. 

Jan: Was Judas present here in verse 29? 
Andrew: Judas had already left the dinner. 
Wisam: This depends on whether the book of John has been written chronologically. But this is possible. 
Sam: Perhaps verse 30 contains the answer. 
Sam is reading from a commentary now. It's too much to translate. But in short, it says that Jesus already knew what the thoughts were of the disciples. It shows that even without the disciples asking Jesus, Jesus already can answer them because He knows their thoughts. It also creates extra faith in Jesus because this shows that Jesus is God, because only God would know their minds. 

Jürgen: It so beautiful to know that Jesus knows everything about us. 
Sam: and if He knows everything about us, it also means He knew He was about to be cruficied. 

Wisam: Then comes verse 33. 
Jure: In verse 20 we are promised that there will be crying, but happiness is also promised to us, yet this happens in the future, not in this world. 
Jan: this future will be soon. It will not take very long. 

Jan: verse 23. On that day you will ask me nothing. Which day is that? 
Jessica: Perhaps this means that we will not ask Jesus anything anymore, because we will ask the Father directly. Because before the crucifixion we could not ask the Father, but had to ask the Son. But after the crucifixion we could ask the Father. 

Jure: See verse 24. How come we do not receive anything? 
Sam: If you're praying and you don't see any results, you shouldn't be discouraged. John Locke said that when he didn't receive anything from God, his hope would only become sweeter. 

Jan: He's talking about Hugo's back, and that God healed his back. 

Wisam: Verse 33 struck me. There's a big contrast between the world and Christians. You will have peace IN ME. You will be persecuted, but Jesus gives 
1. Peace
2. courage
3. victory. 

Jure: In 1 John we also see the question: Who is He Who has conquered the world? 

Sandra: I liked verse 8 and I have a question about that, but I didn't understand the explanation about (1) sin, (2) Justice (3) condemnation or judgment. 

Jure: In 1 Corinthians there is an explanation that Jesus has now become righteousness Himself. It is because Jesus has died that righteousness has risen. 

Wisam: What is the link between righteousness and Jesus' death? 
During the crucifixion? Did we receive righteousness? No. But when exactly? 
Jure: before the creation of the world the lamb was already slaughtered. 
Wisam: at the cross, He said "it is finished", but what had finished? 
Justification was finished at the resurrection. 
There is righteousness because He went to the Father. 
The proof is: at the time that Christians will rise from the dead, this will prove that Jesus is God. 

Sandra: So this means that that when Jesus died at the cross, He knew He would also go to the Father afterwards. Dying at the cross was not sufficient and the work was not finished then. 

Wisam: Justification is a status we have in Jesus Christ. It means we have defeated the devil. 
Jesus rose from the dead and conquered death himself. 

Jessica: can we say that at the cross the power of the sin was conquered? 
Jure: At the moment the perfect lamb died, there was atonement for our sins. 
Sam: His life on Earth already was sort of punishment of Jesus, but at the cross it was fin

Jessica: can we say that at the cross the power of the sin was conquered? 
Jure: At the moment the perfect lamb died, there was atonement for our sins. 
Sam: His life on Earth already was sort of punishment of Jesus, but at the cross it was finished. 

Jürgen: This is a philosophical question, but to keep it simple: the resurrection is the proof that we have forgiveness. If there were a body in the grave, we would not have any proof, but now that He has risen, we know that He lives and we will too and that He is able to make us rise again from the dead. 

Jesus lived without sin, and if He goes to heaven, this is righteousness. It is fair that He can go to heaven and we cannot go. 

Jan: I like what you say. 
Wisam: What you said about when there is a human being, and if he died he could only die for one person. I don't think that is possible. 
Jessica: There is text in Job or James, that a man's righteousness can only save himself. 
Wisam: A sacrifice has to be perfect. For example on the cross there is a perfect person who's willing to die for Andrew. Then if he dies, he is only able to die for the sins Andrew has committed up until that moment. 

Secondly, a person always sins against God Himself. And this sin against God is infinitely great. So even a perfect person's atonement would never be great enough to save Andrew. 

Jure: In Acts 17:30-31 it is said...
Esther: it is important to notice that the disciples were proclaiming His Resurrection and not his crucifixion. 

Jan: What is the use of forgiveness if there is no eternal life? 
Sam: We focus on the aspect of justification. On the cross Jesus was coronated. He had a crown and a cloak. It seemed like He was defeated, but He was in fact crowned as the king. 

Jure: In Colossians 2:9 

Jürgen: There a nice book about the coronation of Jesus, called "How Jesus become the King" 

They are asking me about verse 8, because it's very difficult. 

Esther: The lord of this world, the Satan, is trying to make us afraid. But if we know that the lord of this world has already been judged, then we can be free. 
We can be witnesses, but we cannot convince others, because it is the Holy Spirit who does that. 
So that's why I pray that the Holy Spirit will convince others about judgment and condemnation. 

Jure: today I was on the street Evangelizing and Chantal was with her mother who is an unbeliever. 
So Chantal asked: Mom, do you read the Bible? 
"Well, not always" and I told her to read it more often. 
And then we read the Bible together. 
Maybe she finds it boring to read the Bible. My mother says she believes in God, but she never speaks about God. So that's why I asked her this question (because she thinks she's a Christian). 
I asked her about the law of God, the Ten Commandments. "It's not only about doing those commandments, but it shows how holy God is. It shows how perfect He is. 
Mom, do you know where you will go to when you die?" 
She was doubting and I could explain it to her again and speak about Ephesians 2 and analyze everything. "Mom, do you understand everything that's written in here?" And we read Romans 1 and the state of man and that we will go to hell if we don't believe in God and obey Him. 
Then she told me that her grandmother in Suriname needs money for the elderly home and Chantal's mom said that she pays money. Then Chantal said: 
"Mom, Do you think you are a good person?"
"Yes"
"It's good that you do these good things, but God's standard is much higher. Look at the law. Even if you have kept all these laws, then still there has been so much sin in your life. You are a sinner." And she started crying and escape the conversation by starting to clean the house. 

So please let us pray for Chantal's mother.
Rubian is her name. 

Jürgen: Lord thank You that we can pray to you and ask you everything in Jesus' Name. We come before your throne and bring Rubian before your throne and that she realizes she is a sinner. Only you are able to convince her. We pray and thank You that you have come to Earth for us and also for Rubian. 
We pray for every  conversation that you will take care of Rubian and preach to her so that she will completely understand  you and be convinced of the Gospel. 
We believe that we have already received this and we ask that your will may be done. 

Father, we also want to thank You that you are present here in our midst. thank You for your Word and for every person who's the Word, ;everywhere in the world. Please  take away the evil that prevents them to Hear You in every house. We want to see your kingdom come soon, and we thank You you for your presence, your spirit and your love. 

Almighty God, I want to thank You for the testimonies about you and those who have seen you crucified and that you fill us with your Holy Spirit. It is so supernatural what you are doing. We can feel you and have such happiness. This is for Rubian, but also for so many other persons on the prayer list that we have written. You are letting the seeds grow and we can see that. I know that one day we will stand before your throne. 
Please take away all of our worries, because we do not need to worry about anything. 
In Jesus Name. Amen.

Esther: I am worried about my daughter, and I have been reading the book of Daniel. But Daniel was praising God when he was explaining the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, for God changes the times and appoints kings and gives wisdom. He knows that is truth and light. 
And so I become peaceful again and happy again because I know that God is almighty. 
And now I read about this happiness and joy again. 
So perhaps this is what is meant in verse 22 when Jesus said we would be sad but happy at the same time. 
So there is a great joy when Jesus is crowned, but sadness at the same time, when he left us for heaven. 

Jure: So the Bible says: rejoice IN THE Lord. Not just rejoice, but if you see what God did. I am not happy if I look at myself, but if I look at what God has done, then I get happy. 

Sam: Nebuchadnezzar as well had to suffer when he became arrogant. But as soon as he was broken, He came to know God. 

Jan: Can you pray for my daughter (because she's an unbeliever). I want to bring her to a Christian brother so that she can know other Christians. 
 
Daniel: I am too weak to go to church, I often skip church, I am too lazy and don't feel like going to church. 

Wisam: Let's pray for the work these brothers are doing, street Evangelization. Jure is most often on the street.
