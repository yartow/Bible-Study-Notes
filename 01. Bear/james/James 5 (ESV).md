# James 5 (ESV) 
***Warning to the Rich***
*1 Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. 2 Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten. 3 Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure in the last days.*

The first five verses of this chapter seem to be references to the key verses that the readers of this book would be very well aware of. They consist of quotes from Jesus (v.3, cf. Matthew 6:19) and a reference at the blood of Abel that cried out against Cain who killed him (v.4, cf. Genesis 4:10). 

Of course gold and silver cannot corrode, but James is pointing out here that the valuable things people store on Earth, no matter how incorruptible, will be destroyed. The fact alone that people cannot take these valuables to the next world is equivalent to these things being destroyed. 

*4 Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, are ::crying:: out against you, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.*

Here too, perhaps a reference is made toward the wages that the Lord of the vineyard, which is Jesus, had promised to its laborers. Jesus kept His promise, but the addressees of this letter did not. 
Even though we cannot see the witnesses of the crimes we do in secret, God has made it all but clear in His Word that He sees everything, symbolized by the blood and the money as His witnesses. 
Not very coincidentally both blood and money are used as evidence in court these days. Money can be traced through transactions—and even more so now most of these are digital and still more when everything takes place through blockchains—and blood contains tracks of the victim's activities and leaves traces on the surrounding and on the perpetrator, which are almost unremovable.
People have become smarter in laundering money and dealing on the black market to become untraceable and also they have thought of chemicals to remove blood stains off of clothing. Perhaps God will come with other ways to track the perpetrators in the future, just like fingerprints and DNA research were not heard of in the past but were used retroactively to imprison suspects. But for now, all we need to know is that God has sufficient testimony through the blood and money that cry out to Him for righteousness and justice. 

*5 You have lived on the earth in luxury and in self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. 6 You have condemned and murdered the righteous person. He does not resist you.*

Here too, I see references to the rich man who did not help the poor Lazarus (v.5) and Herod Antipas (v.6). I am uncertain of what the last sentence means, but Jesus, Who was a righteous person, did not resist Herod. #biblestudy/questions Perhaps it means: "and he cannot resist you." 
*MacSBNnkjv* explains that these words are implied as being used in court. #todo/nogaftemaken There is a whole build-up of the wicked starting off with .... and ending with wanting to sustain their wealth and status even if it means they need to bribe judges and condemn or even kill people. 
 We know that when there are corrupt judges, the poor cannot resist the powerful who have many and are friends with the lawyers and judges. Even in the fictional series *Suits* #tags/movies (though it is based on the reality of the life of lawyers) we see that lawyers and judges know each other, and even though they are competitive, they can be easily bribed either with shameful things or with rewards. Lawyers also know which judges are friendly with them and perhaps can even choose their own judges to rule in certain cases.  

***Patience in Suffering***
*7 Be patient, therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient about it, until it receives the early and the late rains. 8 You also, be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.*

In the first six verses James was addressing the rich and wicked, but here he is addressing the Christian brothers. If we do not want to be like the wicked, we need to be patient. If we are not, we will become like them, wanting to get rich quick by any means necessary. Just take a look at mobster movies, which are usually about immigrants who have a fiery temperament both in the character as well as in their passion for riches. In every movie at one point in their life, they become corrupt and tread on other people. They might be the best among their people, such as the Don in *The Godfather* or Robert de Niro's #tags/famouspeople/actors role in *Casino* #tags/movies, but they are still corrupt and the cause of many deaths. 
We need to be patient and let God decide on everything. The rains are controlled by God and the growth of the harvest is controlled by God. The only promise we get is that the Lord will come. We should not take matters into our own hands. 

*9 Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door.*

I think James put this warning in here to Christians know grumbling is a sin as well. We may not express negativity towards God, we may not be cursing one another or blaspheming the Lord, but the slightest negativity which is not even fully expressed in words(Footnote: In the the HSV "grumbling" is translated as "sighing", which is without any word at all.) or in a loud voice but nevertheless charged with enough negativity to influence other people. For God it does not matter whether a sin is towards another person or to Him, for every sin is against God eventually. It does matter how great or small a sin is, but no matter how small, this is still going to be judged.
I do not think, however, that James viewed this sin as small. I believe there must be another reason for mentioning this sin, one of these being that this was and still is very common. A small sin done very often can become bigger than a big sin. Grumbling pertains a form of dissatisfaction with the situation and possibly with the people who caused this situation. As Christians we had rather yet be thankful and content with any and every circumstance (Colossians 3:15-17, Philippians 4:11).

*10 As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. 11 Behold, we consider those blessed who remained steadfast. You have heard of the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.*

The prophets here are mentioned as those who were suffering and patient. They were suffering not only in the end, when many of them were tortured or killed, but they were suffering in the mean time as well when they harassed or being viewed as crazy. To name but a few, Hosea was probably looked down upon for marrying an adulterous woman (if she already had that reputation, but most surely afterwards, when she ran away to a brothel) and for buying her back instead of divorcing her, to which he supposedly had every right(Footnote: Moses allowed divorce, as Jesus explained, but only because the people were intent on divorcing anyway, but in doing so he commanded them to write a certificate of divorce so that the divorced woman would not be seen as an adulteress when marrying another man.)
Elijah suffered for years under the dominion of Ahab and Jezebel. He brought drought for three years (vv.17-18) and if God willed it he could have asked for fire and brimstone on the literal house of Ahab and Jezebel years ago, so he and the people would not have to suffer, but he was patient and waited for God's right time to act.

*12 But above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your “yes” be yes and your “no” be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation.*

Starting this letter with the dangers of the tongue, and now ending it again with the tongue, whether speaking in words through grumbling, or in truth, through promises, James emphasizes the importance of what we say and how we say things. Lying and not keeping one's promise do not fall under the Ninth Commandment per se but it is clear from the Bible and from any other culture that this is not something good. 
In Eastern cultures there is always something hidden from the truth for reasons of politeness or for shame, perhaps the Bible does not judge lying for that reason, but speaking falsely is another thing. In Islamic culture it is even allowed to lie for a greater purpose, for example when Palestine (and also other countries #todo/opzoeken ) made a peace treaty with Israel but not keep their promise after a few years or even less. Their greater purpose was to kill the Jews and in this way their lies were justified according to Islam. Many of these likewise things happened in Muhammad's time as well, as described either in the Quran or in the Haddith. #tags/religion/islam

#todo/nogaftemaken 
Somewhere else in the Bible it says, #todo/opzoeken 
> Above all, love each other, cover everything with love   
And in Colossians 3 
> Above all, be thankful   
But here swearing is put above all, or in other words, honesty. 
Now these are not contradicting each other. The love for God is the highest, but equally to it is the love for one's neighbor. This implies honesty 
#biblestudy/questions but what about thankfulness then? 


***The Prayer of Faith***
*13 Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise. 14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up.*

Prayers are first of all meant for us to have contact with our heavenly Father, so we get to know Him more, but also so that we may become more bold in telling God our needs. Prayer is meant for every purpose, be it in suffering or in cheerfulness and everything in between that as well. In practise, however, we see that Christian usually only pray fervently in the extremities. We should pray for the little joys in our life as well and for the little sadnesses. Moreover, we should pray with others and let others pray for us. Lastly, we should pray for things inside our body and those outside of our body.
In other words, we should pray in three dimensions on the axes of cheerfulness, number of people, self-focussedness. #todo/opzoeken/nederlands niet helemaal het woord dat ik zoek, maar ik leg het uit. #church/material/sermon 
The first dimension is how often we pray in all of our moods or in other words, for petition in the form of encouragement and comfort versus thankfulness and praise. 
The second dimension has a discrete axis and consists of how often one prays with other people. I expect this to be downward sloping. 
The last dimension can be explained as follows. This axis has the following discrete values.
1. The spirit
2. The soul 
3. The mind
4. The body
5. One's career
6. Other people's benefits
7. The world

*And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. ::16 Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.::* #biblestudy/memorization/nathan/todo

There is not clearly a right and wrong of where one's peaks should be in this 3D-graph. The only clear thing would be that would prays consistently (on the first axis) and that one does not overemphasize or neglect one of the categories on the third axis. This part in vv.15b-16 also shows that praying for a clean spirit, i.e. the forgiveness of sin, goes along with praying with another person, in order to be healed. Sometimes prayer is more powerful when the right points on the three axes are connected to each other. In that sense, to add the first dimension to this type of prayer in v.16, we should not only do this when we feel bery bad about our sins, but even when we feel good and have not fallen into sin, we should confess our sins to one another, because we have always sinned. 

*17 Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth. 18 Then he prayed again, and heaven gave rain, and the earth bore its fruit.*

We also have to know that our prayers can establish miracles as great, if not greater, than what Elijah prayer for. Our prayers can let the Holy Spirit work in an unbeliever and make him repent. There is nothing more difficult than that. The whole creation was made in a split second or six days, but after 6,600 years humanity still has not changed their ways. 

*19 My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back, 20 let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.*
 
What we do for unbelievers has a greater effect than anything else others are doing for them. The world thinks that it helps sinners by accepting them as they profess who they are. The world tries to help people in the LGBTQ-community #tags/lgbt by encouraging them to follow their preferred gender and to express themselves and even "rebuild" themselves as such, but Christians help them by telling them who they really are according to the Bible and remove the lies they have been told.
In return the Christian gets nothing. Verse 20 does not speak that the one who brings back a sinner will receive a great reward, no, he will merely cover a multitude of sins *of the sinner*. Of course Christians will get their receive their wages according to their labor (1 Corinthians 3:8), but our purpose is not these wages, but to love God and the ones He created.
