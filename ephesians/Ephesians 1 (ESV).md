# Ephesians 1 (ESV) 
***Greeting***
*1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,*
*To the saints who are in Ephesus, and are faithful in Christ Jesus:*
*2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.*

***Spiritual Blessings in Christ***
*3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with ::every spiritual blessing:: in the heavenly places, 4 even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless ::before:: him.*

God's goal is that we are holy and blameless before Him and for this reason He blessed us. His blessings have a purpose. Just like we can ask God anything we wish for in Jesus' Name and that He will grant it for us so that we can fulfill our task here on Earth, in the same way we are spiritually blessed with the purpose to be holy and blameless before God. 
We should be holy and blameless wherever we are, but we should especially be like this before God. In fact, where is this place "before" God? This is literally everywhere because He is everywhere. Why would Paul write these two words then? God is everywhere, but not everything is before Him. Many will not go to God and many will not face Him. Not that anyone could ever look God in the eyes or even in the face, but they do not even want to nor are they ever seeking His face. God will not even show them His face, because they are unworthy of this (cf. Jeremiah 18:17). So these blessings are for those who are seeking His face and to whom God will show His face (Footnote: see also https://www.gotquestions.org/seek-Gods-face.html.) (cf. 2 Chronicles 7:14, Psalm 105:4).
What then does it mean to have "every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places"? First of all it is not any blessing that can be received here on Earth but not in heaven, such as material blessings or even those of having children or a wife, because these things are not present in heaven. But the blessings we can expect in heaven is to know God and be near Him, have peace and feel safe. These, among others, we will have here on Earth as well—again, I emphasize—in order to be holy and blameless.  How does this help us to be holy and blameless then? It is because all sin and unholiness will not let us know God, be near Him, have peace and feel safe. Everytime Christians sin they feel this and their hatred towards the flesh rises up and they put to death these deeds of the body (cf. Romans 8:13). 

*In love 5 he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, 6 to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved.*

This part describes what God did, why He did this and what He did with it. It is already written in these two verses, but to make it really clear I will repeat it and rephrase it. 
*Point 1.* What did God do? He adopted us, or better said He will adopt us.
*Point 2.* Why did God do this? First, because God willed it, but second, to give Himself praise.
*Point 3.* For what attribute does God receive praise? For His glorious grace. 
This grace has been given to us in Point 1, through Jesus Christ, otherwise this point would not have been possible. 

*7 In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, 8 which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight 9 making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ*

In Jesus Christ we have received two things: redemption, until the first comma in v.8, and a revelation of His will. The forgiveness mentioned here is to explain the result of this redemption. Where a redemption of prisoners taken captive in war for example the redemption results in freedom. Being redeemed from financial debt results in financial freedom (of course depending on what the definition is thereof), and redemption from our sin results in freedom in our spiritual lives. 
The riches of His grace are the delimiters of the redemption, for no one can give more than he has in grace, but in this case God's grace is infinite and in effect the redemption and forgiveness are as well. Hence these delimiters are mentioned here to *emphasize* His limitlessness. 
The wisdom and insight could refer to us having all wisdom and insight in knowing God's will, or it could be that God made known this mystery in all wisdom and insight. Just like the "according to the riches of grace"-part in v.7 this seems to be redundant because God is always acting in all wisdom and insight, but unlike v.7 I do not see any emphasis here. My guess is still that it refers to the second interpretation. The "according to his purpose" part reveals that God does not make us known everything about His will or about the end-time mentioned in v.10.  

*10 as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.*

God also has a purpose for revealing the mystery of His will, which is to unite everything in this universe. God's plan encompasses both Heaven and Earth, when both are united on the New Earth; it encompasses all peoples, whether Jew or Gentile (cf. Romans 3:29); it does not encompass all religions for there is only One God (cf. Romans 3:30). 

*11 In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will, 12 so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory.*

We obtained this inheritance not for our own glory nor for our own benefits, but for God's glory only. Just like we have received the authority to ask anything in Jesus' Name for God's glory and Jesus *will* do that, because that glorifies the Father (John 14:13). 

What then does the "praise of His glory" mean? It means that God has glory, but not everyone on Earth is praising Him for it. Whatever we do will not increase His glory, because it is already at the highest possible level. If anything, God is the *definition* of glory itself. Yet who will appreciate and show this appreciation through praise? We can praise Him, but God wants the whole world to praise Him, so that is why we have received our inheritance to show the world the goodness of God, for with our inheritance come the Holy Spirit and the power that comes through Him, but also a peace that the world has never seen before (see John 14:27, cf. Ephesians 4:7). Through this peace we can show the world that even in hardships we thrive and in sufferings we endure (Philippians 4:11-12) so that others will praise God for our attitude, which was only possible through the Holy Spirit's working in us. We see examples of this in the kings of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar and Darius the Mede, and Persia, Cyrus and Artaxerxes, who praised the God of Israel through the courage of Daniel, his friends and Ezra and other believers of the Lord Yahweh.

*13 In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, 14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.*

* We were predestined *to the praise of the glory of God's grace*
* We have obtained an inheritance *to the praise of God's glory*
* We are sealed with the Holy Spirit *to the praise of God's glory*


***Thanksgiving and Prayer***
*15 For this reason, because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, 16 I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, 17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him, 18 having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, ::that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you::, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, 19 and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his great might 20 that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, 21 far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.*

All of the above Paul is asking of God to show us, because we do not see this *as it is*. In short, Paul is saying that there is a hope, meant for us, that even when we are in the most difficult situations we can rely on this hope, which will never put us down. This hope promises us more than we can imagine and contains
* the riches of a glorious inheritance, such as the saints before us have received
* the immeasurable greatness of God's power for believers.
Paul goes on to explain 

*22 And he put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, 23 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.*

Jesus Christ is not only head of everything in creation, He is also the head of the Church. This would seem logical, for the Church is part of creation, but I can understand why something like this is said. Quite often people tend to isolate themselves or give themselves a prerogative so that certain rules do not apply to them. They know the government is head of the state (Footnote: Except for the United States, where the governer is the head, and government is the head of all states combined together, though not in all jurisdictions.), but they exclude themselves from the authority of the government over the people.
