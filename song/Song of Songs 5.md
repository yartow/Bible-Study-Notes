***He***
*I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride;*
*I have gathered my myrrh with my spice.*
*I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;*
*I have drunk my wine and my milk.*

He has now come and entered her garden and enjoyed everything that is in it. It is noticeable that it is not she who has entered his garden. 
No matter the culture, this is how women are shaped. It is always a bigger thing for woman to open up her sexuality and it is more locked up than a man's is. The reason for that is because it is more precious. 
In my own terms, the garden of a man—if he had any—would not contain this many kinds of choice fruit. The man just wants to fill his stomach, but a woman enjoys on multiple levels when having sex. 

***Friends***
*Eat, friends, and drink;*
*drink your fill of love.*

This is a confirmation—either by friends or by God—that it is not bad to enjoy this "fill of love", or in other words, sex. It is the satan who wants to cover up sex, because this is what creates new children. 
God put the desire for sex in us, especially in men, so that man would at least multiply. Satan knows he cannot destroy this desire that God put in us, so he uses it in other ways. 
In some cultures he tries to cover it up as a bad thing and that women should not enjoy it. Also, he makes it a secret thing that no one can talk about. So if there are problems, there is no one to talk to. These are mostly the conservative cultures. 
In other cultures he makes people explicit about it to the extreme. People talk about their most open feelings, but do not treat sex as holy but as public. Everyone can and should have sex with anyone they like. He makes the people forget the reason for sex, which is not to enjoy oneself, but to let the other person enjoy and to have children.

***She***
*I slept but my heart was awake.*
*Listen! My beloved is knocking:*
*“Open to me, my sister, my darling,*
*my dove, my flawless one.*
*My head is drenched with dew,*
*my hair with the dampness of the night.”*
*I have taken off my robe—*
*must I put it on again?*
*I have washed my feet—*
*must I soil them again?*

Even in her dreams she was fully aware of her feelings. Her anxieties in real life show up even in her dreams. 
Do not worry too much, or in fact do not worry at all (cf. Php 4:6), or you will worry in your dreams as well and then you have not enough rest, which will make you even more stressed out during the day.

*My beloved thrust his hand through the latch-opening;*
*my heart began to pound for him.*
*I arose to open for my beloved,*
*and my hands dripped with myrrh,*
*my fingers with flowing myrrh,*
*on the handles of the bolt.*
*I opened for my beloved,*
*but my beloved had left; he was gone.*
*My heart sank at his departure.*
*I looked for him but did not find him.*
*I called him but he did not answer.*

She is afraid she missed his call and that he did not wait for her anymore. I used to think that as well, when I was so uncertain of whether a girl liked me or not. If she did not respond, I would think that maybe it is because I missed some sign of hers. Now I know, though, that if a girl is interested, you can approach her and she will be susceptible. If she is not, she will be friendly or cold, but not open to avances. 
So in this case, for the woman, she is afraid he is gone. My advice for her would be to consider two things: he either really does not care about you, because he would wait at the door if he really liked you, even if you were too slow to open the door, or he does like you and he will come later, as promised.
Do not go around keeping your hopes up. Live your life as it should be, and if he comes, be surprised and enjoy the new life. 

*The watchmen found me*
*as they made their rounds in the city.*
*They beat me, they bruised me;*
*they took away my cloak,*
*those watchmen of the walls!*

I am not sure of why the watchmen are bad and who they might suppose to be an analogy of. The watchmen of a city are supposed to protect its citizens. 
Perhaps it is those people, like her brothers, who were supposed to protect her, and very well might have protected her all this time from boys and young men chasing her, to save her virginity for her future husband, who are also keeping her away from her future husband. 
In the Islam it is the brother or father who has the responsibility to reprimand and bring back the daughter or sister when she has turned away from Islam. Sometimes this happens by beating. 
In this case the brothers might not want her to get married at all because in this way she can work for free for them all of her life. In a sense they are doing that and keeping her as a slave, because she is tanned and in this way nobody wants to marry her.

*Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you —*
*if you find my beloved,*
*what will you tell him?*
*Tell him I am faint with love.*

Though a dream, it is good to tell others who is your lover, so others will know that he is yours. Perhaps others will also know the amount of your love then, and refrain from chasing him, in order not to hurt you, assuming they have some sympathy for you or for love in general. 

***Friends***
*How is your beloved better than others,*
*most beautiful of women?*
*How is your beloved better than others,*
*that you so charge us?*

As for her friends, it is good to ask again and again why this lover is good or better than others. First of all to set the standard high of choosing a spouse and second of all to test the girl and what she likes about him and to be critical of her love for him. One must know that love is a feeling but should not be only a feeling. One must love what is right and not overlook the bad things, but merely cover these. 

***She***
*My beloved is radiant and ruddy,*
*outstanding among ten thousand.*
*His head is purest gold;*
*his hair is wavy*
*and black as a raven.*
*His eyes are like doves*
*by the water streams,*
*washed in milk,*
*mounted like jewels.*
*His cheeks are like beds of spice*
*yielding perfume.*
*His lips are like lilies*
*dripping with myrrh.*
*His arms are rods of gold*
*set with topaz.*
*His body is like polished ivory*
*decorated with lapis lazuli.*
*His legs are pillars of marble*
*set on bases of pure gold.*
*His appearance is like Lebanon,*
*choice as its cedars.*
*His mouth is sweetness itself;*
*he is altogether lovely.*
*This is my beloved, this is my friend,*
*daughters of Jerusalem.*

Though she is merely praising his looks and image, she is "mesmerized" by him, it seems. Looking up to a man is a great thing for a woman to do. It is at place number 5 of what men need. "He needs her to look up to him" (or something like that).
Perhaps Solomon was aware of all that. Though I doubt he had knowledge of modern psychology, he has already touched upon a few points in relations concerning "his needs and her needs", as stated by Willard F. Harley in his book, *His needs, her needs*.
1. Solomon has pointed out that she needs affection (No. 1) which Solomon has clearly shown. His first need is that he needs sex. 
2. Her second and third need is that he talks and is open and honest. The talking is not shown here in this book, but the lack of openness and honesty is. It is what causes her fears, because he did not tell her he is a king nor where he was coming from.
3. He, on the other hand, needs a playmate (No. 2). It has not been described how much they have been doing together, but his third need is *peace and quiet*, which is the reason why he went to the north in the first place. 
4. In the fourth place she needs to be financially secure, to be taken care of. She is not taken care of by her brothers, as she always had to work not only for herself, but for them. For the rest, I do not know, but I suppose she had their protection. At Solomon's place, however, it was the other way around. She now had no financial troubles, but she had other worries, namely about insecurity due to his other wives. That is one thing Harley—or the women who filled in the questionnaires for that matter—left out. 
5. This has to do with No 4. of the man, which is "He needs an attractive wife". It is the very reason he has married 60—most likely—beautiful queens. And now the Shunnamite is very beautiful as well, as mentioned in Song 4, but not on par yet with the queens, who have been balmed and kept out of the sun, or the contemporary standards. It is like a beautiful 5'5" (1.65m) woman with perfect proportions, next to a 6' (1.82m) topmodel who literally stands out a head taller than other women, who is even thinner, has a better skin and even more perfect in other fields. The smaller woman fades away. 
6. Lastly
