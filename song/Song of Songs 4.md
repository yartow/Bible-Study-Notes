***He***
*How beautiful you are, my darling!*
*Oh, how beautiful!*
*Your eyes behind your veil are doves.*
*Your hair is like a flock of goats*
*descending from the hills of Gilead.*
*Your teeth are like a flock of sheep just shorn,*
*coming up from the washing.*
*Each has its twin;*
*not one of them is alone.*
*Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon;*
*your mouth is lovely.*
*Your temples behind your veil*
*are like the halves of a pomegranate.*
*Your neck is like the tower of David,*
*built with courses of stone;*
*on it hang a thousand shields,*
*all of them shields of warriors.*
*Your breasts are like two fawns,*
*like twin fawns of a gazelle*
*that browse among the lilies.*

The king now comes, perhaps after a long time, and the first thing he does is praise her looks. Beauty is what a woman desires. Perhaps, that too, is something that can be scientifically proven, that women desire beauty more than men.
He starts of with the face, then the neck and ends with the breasts. The face would be acceptable to talk about in our culture, to say to a woman, but praising a breast is too far on the sexual side. 
Of course, between a man and a woman this can be done, but notice that the two lovers are not married yet. Also, the breast is something that is covered for a reason, namely because it is not meant to be seen by anyone but her husband. 
For that reason I find it not acceptable for an unmarried person to praise these sexual parts of the body. But perhaps I am wrong and breasts were as common as they are in African tribes, where women walk around naked, or as in the ancient Greek culture, where statues and drawings of naked women were common, and the Amazons even had one breast uncovered—or cut off, so there was nothing to see anymore. 

*Until the day breaks*
*and the shadows flee,*
*I will go to the mountain of myrrh*
*and to the hill of incense.*
*You are altogether beautiful, my darling;*
*there is no flaw in you.*

I am not sure what he is referring to. Myrrh could refer to worship—the Lord or another god, as Solomon was already worshipping other gods at this time—or these mountains could refer to other roundings of women. But see the verses below. 

*Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,*
*come with me from Lebanon.*
*Descend from the crest of Amana,*
*from the top of Senir, the summit of Hermon,*
*from the lions’ dens*
*and the mountain haunts of leopards.*

It could also mean that these mountains are a far away place, indicating how far he was, sexually, from her. He would go back to his mountain as she would go back to her place, the Lebanon, instead of going to one place together. 

*You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride;*
*you have stolen my heart*
*with one glance of your eyes,*
*with one jewel of your necklace.*
*How delightful is your love , my sister, my bride!*
*How much more pleasing is your love than wine,*
*and the fragrance of your perfume*
*more than any spice!*

Wine gives pleasure, by numbing out feelings, especially the negative ones, but unfortunately also the positive ones. A woman's love is authentic, it pleases without numbing.

*Your lips drop sweetness as the honeycomb, my bride;*
*milk and honey are under your tongue.*

Is this a figure of tongue kissing? How else could Solomon know there are "milk and honey" *under* the tongue? 

*The fragrance of your garments*
*is like the fragrance of Lebanon.*
*You are a garden locked up, my sister, my bride;*
*you are a spring enclosed, a sealed fountain.*
*Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates*
*with choice fruits,*
*with henna and nard,*
*nard and saffron,*
*calamus and cinnamon,*
*with every kind of incense tree,*
*with myrrh and aloes*
*and all the finest spices.*
*You are a garden fountain,*
*a well of flowing water*
*streaming down from Lebanon.*

She is a garden, where no one has entered, in other words, a virgin. In her garden are choice fruits. Are these perhaps special characteristics or traits that she only shows to her husband? These could be tender caress and loving or sensual words. 

***She***
*Awake, north wind,*
*and come, south wind!*
*Blow on my garden,*
*that its fragrance may spread everywhere.*
*Let my beloved come into his garden*
*and taste its choice fruits.*

First she says "my garden", and then it's "his garden". In the next verse he even says "my garden", which means that her body has become his now. 
She is willing to unlock her virginity now, to give it to him, but him only.
