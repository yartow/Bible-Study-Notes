# Acts 23 (ESV) 
#todo/nogaftemaken 
*1 And looking intently at the council, Paul said, “Brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day.” 2 And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth. 3 Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?” 4 Those who stood by said, “Would you revile God's high priest?”*

Ananias probably was not wearing his high-priestly garment which is why Paul could not recognize who the High-Priest was. The office of High-Priest iterated quite often, sometimes even after on year. Paul served under Caiaphas at the time (see Acts 9 #todo/opzoeken bevestigen) he still prosecuted Christians. 
Why would Ananias not be wearing his official garments? It could be that the tribune suddenly wanted a hearing with the Sanhedrin and headed for it when they were not ready and dressed. This would be very similar to Jesus' arrest in the middle of the night, at the house of Annas and then Caiaphas, when these were not prepared as well. 

*5 And Paul said, “I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it is written, You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’”*

Paul shows his respect for the Law in that even when he had been hit, not merely a slap but an actual blow (which also happened to Jesus #todo/opzoeken), in the face, he still apologizes (though not using the word "sorry" for that probably did not exist in Hebrew). He also shows how much he loves and respects the Law as Jew by quoting from the Law, by memory. How much more does he need to prove that he is an actual Jew and has not abandoned the Law? 

*6 Now when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.”*

Some time might have been between verses 5 and 6, and though it does not seem to be much, it was enough for Paul to perceive differences between the two group. Paul uses these differences to dissent #todo/opzoeken/engels correct? and divide the groups even further so that one party might choose for him. 
One might ask whether it is morally correct to divide a group so the attention is focused on the dissension instead of one yourself. In some cases the suspect can make use of the situation to escape, but this is not what Paul did. In other cases the suspect can pick a side so that that side would protect him, but that too is not what Paul did. Paul stayed at his own side, which is the truth, but used one element of his doctrine that overlapped that of the Pharisees in order to get *them* on *his* side. 
This is very different and morally correct. Visually this can be depicted as follows. Imagine a line from left to right with the left depicting the wrong and the right the right theology. The Sadducees would be more on the left than the Pharisees while Christianity would be all the way at the right. The dissension between the Sadducees and the Pharisees would be the distance between the two parties. However, if the Pharisees were to go more to the right the dissension would only increase. 
Though it would be wrong to pull people apart and drive wedges between them, it is never wrong to pull people in right direction, even if that causes the former effect. One could say that one must choose between the lesser evil. 
Jesus brought a sword to divide mother and daughter #todo/opzoeken waar? which bears the same principle. 

*7 And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all. 9 Then a great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended sharply, “We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?”*

Apparently even the Pharisees who found nothing wrong with Paul, still did not believe that the voices Paul heard were actually God's voices.

*10 And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into the barracks.*

As always happens with the Left (although the Pharisees would more fit in an alt-right form) things become violent. On the line drawn above in my previous explanation the right is indeed good, but the alt-right bends toward the left again. So people on the right do not use violence unless it is necessary, but the Left and the alt-right do, when other people refuse to comply with their thoughts. 

*11 The following night the Lord stood by him and said, “Take courage, for as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem, so you must testify also in Rome.”*

Paul needed this comfort--to hear personally from God. After everything that happened here, Paul was not comforted by a message from God telling him that it would soon be over. Instead, God told him that everything would start over again, and--as we know from history and from Paul's letters--things would not only end worse but also take up much more time. 
This message would normally be devastating, especially in a situation like this. Paul had been beaten, almost whipped, spent his nights in the barracks, perhaps chained, and now almost been torn apart. But the reason this message was *comforting* was because *the Lord stood by him*. Anything that is *from the Lord* is comforting. David even chose three days of disease #todo/opzoeken killing a huge number of people in the land, because at least he knew he would be in the hand of God. So to be blessed by God, but also to be punished, is the best thing a person can experience and far better than to be blessed or punished by man or by the Satan. 

***A Plot to Kill Paul***
*12 When it was day, the Jews made a plot and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. 13 There were more than forty who made this conspiracy. 14 They went to the chief priests and elders and said, “We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul. 15 Now therefore you, along with the council, give notice to the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near.”*

How far must one be from the Law to trespass one of the greatest of the Ten Commandments, not to murder someone, which even secular people and people from all other nations know--yes, even those who do not know God know that this is wrong. In this case it is even worse, because they are Jewish, they should know the Law better. Even though there are always people in a culture who disregard the Law or do not know about it, in this case they went and asked the chief priests about it and from the context it seems that they agreed on this. Now this too is not very surprising given the fact that a mere twenty years ago they had tried to trick and lure Jesus multiple times in order to be able to #todo/opzoeken/engels beschuldigen accuse Him of blasphemy. This is the third element in which Paul's life looks like that of Jesus. #church/material Paul's life looked like that of Jesus, so must and will ours. 
I must refer to politics again and the present-day situation where a group of people, called the Antifa, who are perhaps not as devout and zealous as the forty mentioned here, but certainly just as aggressive and kill, loot and destroy in the name of liberty and anti-fascism. Though not proven, it is clear that this group works for the leaders of the Left who should be well proficient in the law (most politicians have studied Law in university). #tags/politics 

*16 Now the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush, so he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.*

We learn something more about Paul here, not only about his family but also about his personality. Apparently his nephew still loved him even though he had become a Christian. Perhaps Paul had spent time with his family and relatives to explain them about the Gospel as well or written letters to them as well. There are many different explanations for this. 

What is remarkable is that his nephew happened to be there at the right time to hear about the ambush, while one would expect to keep these kind of conversations secret. I would also have expected that Paul's relatives were in Tarsus, but even if they were in Jerusalem, for the celebration of Pentecost, it would still be a big coincidence that anyone would be within hearing distance of this group of people within the big city of Jerusalem. 

*17 Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to tell him.” 18 So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said, “Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you.” 19 The tribune took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, “What is it that you have to tell me?” 20 And he said, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him. 21 But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him, who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for your consent.” 22 So the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, “Tell no one that you have informed me of these things.”*

The tribune wanted to keep Paul alive. Though being corrupt—since he paid for his Roman citizenship—he still had his responsibility for the Roman empire to protect its citizens, or it could have been due to fear. Why, however, would he instruct Paul's nephew not to tell anyone that he had told him these things? He was not supposed to tell others about the plan he overheard but especially not that the tribune knew about the plan as well, since that would make that the forty conspiring Jews be more aware of Paul's whereabouts so that the tribune's plan to let Paul escape in the middle of the night would fail. 

***Paul Sent to Felix the Governor***
*23 Then he called two of the centurions and said, “Get ready two hundred soldiers, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea at the third hour of the night. 24 Also provide mounts for Paul to ride and bring him safely to Felix the governor.” 25 And he wrote a letter to this effect:*

The tribune made sure that Paul was on a horse as well. Perhaps this was a luxury, as I assume prisoners would normally have to walk. In this case, this was probably done so that upon an attack Paul could flee away with the other horsemen. 
He also made sure the ambush of the Jews would fail by heavily outnumbering the Jews. Though even forty trained soldiers would have been enough, perhaps even twenty or less, he still took no chances.

*26 “Claudius Lysias, to his Excellency the governor Felix, greetings. 27 This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen. 28 And desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their council. 29 I found that he was being accused about questions of their law, but charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment.*

Comparing this situation to the Left politics of today we see on the one hand that the Left does everything to get rid of politicians who are in their way, especially President Trump. They also use tactics to discredit people in order for them to lose their seat or position. However, they do it in such a way that will make the crowd angry enough to want to kill him. How many people would want President Trump to die. There are billboards enough to show this. Even Trump supporters are being banned from stores or beaten on the streets. How much more would Trump himself be beaten if he were on the streets? #tags/politics 
In the same way the Jews have slandered Paul with lies and accusations of blasphemy, which to the Romans is not enough reason to execute someone for. In the case of Jesus even Pilate did not find Him guilty, but killed Him only because of his fear to lose his position if the Jews would tell his superiors about his bad performance. 

*30 And when it was disclosed to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him.”*

Like Jesus, Paul was also being sent back and forth many times before eventually dying by the hands of the Romans. 

*31 So the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him by night to ::Antipatris.::*

#biblestudy/questions who is this? Or a city name? 

*32 And on the next day they returned to the barracks, letting the horsemen go on with him. 33 When they had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him. 34 On reading the letter, he asked what ::province:: he was from. And when he learned that he was from Cilicia, 35 he said, “I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive.” And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod's ::praetorium::.*

Did the governor ask Paul where he was from in order to confirm that he was a Roman citizen? No, he asked to know whether Paul was under his jurisdiction. According to *MacSBNnkjv* Judah and Syria (in which Cilicia was located) both fell under Felix' jurisdiction.
