# Acts 24 (ESV) 
***Paul Before Felix at Caesarea***
*1 And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a spokesman, one ::Tertullus::. They laid before the governor their case against Paul. 2 And when he had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:*

#biblestudy/questions Was the spokesman like an advocate? Difference between advocate and lawyer. #todo/opzoeken 

*“Since through you we enjoy much peace, and since by your foresight, most excellent Felix, reforms are being made for this nation, 3 in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude. 4 But, to detain you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly. 5 For we have found this man a plague, one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and is a ringleader of the ::sect of the Nazarenes::. 6 He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him. 8 By examining him yourself you will be able to find out from him about everything of which we accuse him.”*
*9 The Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that all these things were so.*
*10 And when the governor had nodded to him to speak, Paul replied:*
*“Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense. 11 You can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem, 12 and they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city. 13 Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me. 14 But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a ::sect::, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets, 15 having a hope in God, which these men themselves accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust.*

Paul summarizes his confession in an orderly three points, of which two points the Sadducees agree with as well—the Pharisees even believe all three, but do not agree with the method through which salvation occurs. 
Paul, however, says that "these men themselves accept" this hope in God of the resurrection as well. Why would he say that when the Sadducees do not believe in the resurrection? The Sadducees did not believe this, but the mainstream Judaism did (see alsoJob 19:25–27; Dan. 12:2 from *MacSBNnkjv*).

We should note that Paul did not take three random points of the Christian doctrine, but he purposefully did not include the element of Gospel or grace. He listed the following elements. 
1. the worship of God Almighty Who is Yahweh
2. the belief in the Word (mentioned as "the Law and the Prophets", but meaning the other e.g. poetic and historic books as well)
3. a hope in God of the resurrection of *both* the just and the unjust.
In fact, Paul is very strict on listing facts rather than methods. 
In another doctrinal statement, which is not contradictory to this one, God saves us *by faith*, which is a gift, through justification by Jesus' blood, by grace—which is actually a description of *how* salvation comes to be. 
Even if Jesus had not died on the cross for us or saved anyone, these three points would still be valid. One could *add* to these points that God has chosen a part of the resurrection of mankind to become His children and in some way that would also be a fact rather than a method (called the *doctrine of election* #biblestudy/theology/predestination/election), but still Paul chose not to include that statement. Why? #biblestudy/questions Perhaps the answer is that this doctrine too is dependent on God's salvation. Paul lists only the bare minimum of what is needed to describe the theistic worldview, without the relational part. Hence *Salvation* is not listed here because that requires this relation.

*16 So I always take ::pains:: to have a clear conscience toward both God and man.*

Paul perhaps did not literally mean he was in pain in order to have a clear conscience—although in fact he was—but he meant that it is of utmost importance that these three points always stayed on his mind. 

What did Paul mean by needing to have a clear conscience toward God concerning these three points? In fact he is saying: *I act according to the Way and hence I need to have a clear conscience*, that is he needs to stay above reproach. Perhaps it is because of the third statement where he mentions the *just and the unjust* and he reminds himself of that he wants to be part of the just. Or perhaps he just needed to remind himself of the difference between the Way and other theologies, which is what he meant with his "conscience". #todo/nogaftemaken #biblestudy/questions

*17 Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings. 18 While I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult. But some Jews from Asia— 19 ::they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation, should they have anything against me.::*

Paul is making the right case that people should accuse others on behalf of themselves, not on behalf of others. Why is it that the Jewish leaders, who were not even present and do not suffice as witnesses, are here to make the accusation? 

*20 Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council, 21 other than this one thing that I cried out while standing among them: ‘It is with respect to the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you this day.’”*

Paul even gives them a leeway by saying they should otherwise say what he did wrong. In their statement they speak of stirring up riots and profaning the temple, but they are not giving details because, of course, they were not present at the time and they are afraid that if they do give details, these will not corroborate each other. Even if they had been witnesses they would not have been able to mention anything that Paul did wrong, for he did not do anything wrong. If he did anything, it would have been in Asia, it is uncertain where but perhaps in Ephesus, where the "Jews from Asia" remembered Paul converting Jews to Christianity. That, however, would be out of the jurisdiction of Felix, first of all, but it would also not be deemed as a valid argument for indictment. 

***Paul Kept in Custody***
*22 But Felix, having a rather ::accurate knowledge:: of the Way, put them off, saying, “When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case.”* 

#biblestudy/questions Did Felix actually know about Christianity or did he think that Judaism was "the Way"?

*23 Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but have some liberty, and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs.*
*24 After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.*

Luke probably mentions that Drusilla was "Jewish" so that the reader is not confused with Felix' first or third wife, whose name was also Drusilla. #todo/opzoeken 
Drusilla was not actually Jewish, because her father, Agrippa I, was a grandson of Herod the Great, who was an Edomite (a descendant of Esau), and her mother was probably Greek, for her name was Cypros, although there is no information on her background on Wikipedia. Agrippa I was only a quarter Jewish on his father Aristobulus' mother's side, Mariamne I. Furthermore, Agrippa I's mother was Berenice I, daughter of Salome I (sister of Herod the Great) and Costobarus (a Greek, I think), so Berenice (Agrippa I's wife) was *not* Jewish at all. This means that Drusilla was only 1/8th Jewish.

*25 And as he reasoned about righteousness and self-control and the coming judgment, Felix was ::alarmed:: and said, “Go away for the present. When I get an opportunity I will summon you.”*

Felix got alarmed as soon as Paul started talking about those points that still today are controversial in churches who preach the prosperity gospel and Word of Faith, such as Hillsong, Joseph Prince, Elevation and Bethel. 

Paul was not allowed to leave the premise, so when Felix said "go away" he said this when Paul was summoned at Felix' house and he meant that Paul should go back to his house. It is interesting that Luke is telling this story because this would mean that everything he wrote down, he heard from Paul. So Paul was aware of Felix' poor character, his immoral actions and his bad conscience and told Luke about it. Perhaps it was for this reason that Paul brought up this sensitive topic of righteousness, self-control (perhaps of women (since Drusilla was his second wife), greed for money and power. See for examples of greed what Felix had presumably done the notes in verse 26 and the links referred to there. Perhaps the fact that he twice married women of a power lineage (both descending from "kings") was a sign of his greed for power. 

*26 At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him.*

Apparently Felix was still a corrupt and greedy man. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonius_Felix)  Felix slayed and plundered the inhabitants of Caesarea. 

*27 When two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus.*

See [this link on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcius_Festus).

*And desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.* 

More of his corrupt character was shown. He cared more about his own wellbeing than Paul's, who was merely one voice out of the many .
