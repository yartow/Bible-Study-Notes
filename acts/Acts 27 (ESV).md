# Acts 27 (ESV) 
***Paul Sails for Rome***
*1 And when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort named Julius. 2 And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica. 3 The next day we put in at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him leave to go to his friends and be cared for.*

It was only by the grace of God that Paul was treated kindly. Festus would probably not have cared if Paul was treated brutally by the centurion as long as he remained alive. 
It is not certain why Luke mentions Aristarchus here. Perhaps it is because he left a good impression on Paul and Paul in turn told much about him to Luke. 
According to tradition Aristarchus had a prominent position as the “bishop” of Thessalonica—although there were no bishops in those times, but probably here an overseer is meant. It could also be that Luke knew about this position of his and thought it worthwhile mentioning. Perhaps Luke and Paul had even met him before. Also, according to tradition Aristarchus died under Nero, which would have been approximately together with Paul's death, since he died by the same hand.

*4 And putting out to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us. 5 And when we had sailed across the open sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia. 6 There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy and put us on board. 7 We sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, and as the wind did not allow us to go farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone. 8 Coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.*
*9 Since much time had passed, and the voyage was now dangerous because even the ::Fast:: was already over, Paul advised them,*

The extent to which Luke provides details is amazing. It is almost as if he wants modern readers to be able to track his voyage. Of course Luke had already mentioned to Theophilus that the books of Luke and Acts were narratives (see Luke 1:1) and hence it would be logical to include many names and eyewitnesses and even places where certain events took place, so that these things could attest to real events in the case one wanted to go back to a specific city and question the people there to see if what happened there was truly as described by Luke, but why would he provide detailed routes on the sea? There is no possible to way to prove that was true, except for a few details such as the ship's arrival at Fair Havens and that this happened after the Fast. 
We can think of one reason now why God inspired Luke to provide these details, which is for us as later readers who would not know the names of the cities mentioned in this letter, as names would change—as they often did—and be different in other languages and sometimes complete cities could even disappear by destruction—as the Romans often had done, by burning these down to the ground and then covering them with salt so that nothing would ever grow there—just like God had done with Jericho. This is merely one of the reasons, however, but for sure there must be more. Other reasons why these details were added could be to judge the credibility of corroborating facts such as the approximate time of the events (after the Fast of Yom Kippur, that is Atonement Day), the size and type of the ship (for 276 people, see picture below), where they were exactly and why anyone would decide to go out on sea in approximately November, how the captain managed the ship and whether it wrecked due to mismanagement (see also https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/St-Paul-s-voyage-and-shipwreck-the-ship-and-its-wise-captain.638728) or actually because of the magnitude of the storm. 
Another reason why I personally think these details are added, is that these details add to the excitement for the reader, and to relive the story.

*10 saying, “Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.” 11 But the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said.*

It is understandable that the centurion was under pressure to listen to both the pilot, which is the captain, who commandeered the ship, and the owner of the ship, who also controlled where to go. The centurion was a mere passenger on this ship and did not have any say in this. Even if he were a high-ranked soldier, his position would be irrelevant on this ship. Still, whether his say would have meant any change in this ship's course does not matter, for he did not speak up for Paul. More importantly, although it is not sure whether the centurion knew, he did not speak up for the truth. 
In this world Christians are under pressure as well and must choose for either the side of the world or that of God. Quite often the world seems to give more pressure, but on the long term the consequences of not following God are shown to be much worse, which in life is always the case. In this specific situation we would see the ultimate result after a mere few days. 
Aside from pressure, speaking out and against the world does not *seem* to have any effect. The voice of the Christian is small and is ridiculed by the masses, so many tend to go for the world instead and hope to gain something there. They hope to find the solution there, because they see no possible way out through God's way. 
There often are scenes in movies depicting two friends or brothers where one decides to join the guerrillas or gangsters, such as in the movie #tags/movies *Slumdog Millionaire*, where the older brother reluctantly and regretfully chooses to join the Islamic gangsters because he sees no other way to make a living on the streets and because he still wants to take revenge on the Hindus who killed his parents. 
The remarkable thing is, all of these movies conclude that the one who does the morally correct thing, in the end, is the person who made the more difficult, but right choice. Even in the case of the above-mentioned movie the older brother does something right, but which would cost him his life. They even show that most people make the wrong choice, despite regretting it and despite the fact that almost all movies hail the one who makes the right decision. If the makers of these movies know this, and the people who watch these movies know this as well, then why do most people still make the wrong choice—or even worse, support it? Only a handful of people in secular history have made the right choice and they are on the right side of history. Examples of these are Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Theresa, Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy. I am not sure about Malcolm X's position and whether he was morally right, but he too, like the others, separated himself from the rest by doing something that required courage, by disassociating themselves from the rest and choosing to do what was right in their eyes. 
As a side-note on JFK, he was probably killed because he wanted to bring back the system where the dollar was backed by gold. This has to do with morality because presumably JFK knew that the monetary system in the United States (but in the world as well) was rigged. #todo/opzoeken create footnote of this
Courage is what most people lack and therefore they follow the masses. Indeed, those with courage, as the above list attests, either die or stay poor. #tags/politics #tags/famouspeople Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States, has not died and is not poor—and it is surprising that no attempt has been performed yet on his life—but he has taken in more punches, insults and slander than any other president of public or political figure, by both his own Republican Party as well as the Democratic Party, during his four-year term. On top of this, it is said he lost more than half of his five billion's worth and has gone into history as the only president who has been impeached twice. Fortunately both of his impeachments did not lead to the possibility for him to have a second term as President. 

*12 And because the harbor was ::not suitable:: to spend the winter in, the ::majority:: decided to put out to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing both ::southwest:: and northwest, and spend the winter there.*

#biblestudy/questions Why was it not suitable? Who is the majority? 
It is not clear who this majority is, it could the ship's crew or the 276 passengers altogether. In such dire circumstance it would not be strange if the passengers were asked for their opinion as well, because their lives were at stake here and a mutiny or uproar is the last thing anyone wanted in this situation.
Here as well, whether Paul wanted something else or not, he would have to ::vote against the majority.:: This seems like a never ending-story, it is just like voting against the liberal masses in this world, in almost every country where the Satan is reigning. Perhaps in Texas and Florida, where there still are conservative governors, one's vote might be on the ultimate decision's side, but in most other states of the US and countries around the world, one's vote will simply get lost in the minority's vote count. Still, however, as Christians we need to vote for the right thing and always stand for it. Never give in and never give up. 
In the #tags/movies *Homeland* series, one of the protagonists, played by #tags/famouspeople Damian Lewis, is kidnapped and refuses to use heroin to numb the pain and get used to the place he is kidnapped in. After a while, though, when he sees there is really no way out for him to escape, he decides to use the heroin after all. He gave in because he lost hope and joined the rest. ::Eventually, every Christian needs to take the right decisions regardless of the expected outcome, because we must never lose hope, for when we are not sure of what we hope for will be true, this means we do not have faith:: (Hebrews 11:1).

***The Storm at Sea***
*13 Now when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to the shore. 14 But soon a tempestuous wind, called the northeaster, struck down from the land. 15 And when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along. 16 Running under the lee of a small island called ::Cauda::, we managed with difficulty to secure the ship's boat.*

Cauda is also named Clauda and Gavdos, under which name it is still known today. 

The description in this part gives the same feeling as Jonah, aside from the whole situation where people were in a ship on the Mediterranean. In the story of Jonah a storm seemed to come out of nothing, controlled by God, the fish was sent by God as well as the location the fish was swimming to. Here it seemed like this northeastern wind came at the wrong time and God did not allow them to reach Phoenix. 
God wanted them to fear Him and know that He controls the outcome of this journey and what happens when one disobeys Him. The people needed to know that the only reason they survived this storm was because of God's mercy. 

*17 After hoisting it up, they used supports to undergird the ship. Then, fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and thus they were driven along. 18 Since we were violently storm-tossed, they began the next day to jettison the cargo. 19 And on the ::third:: day they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands.*

#biblestudy/questions When was the first day? 
Perhaps this was three days into the violent storm counting from Fair Havens. After a mere three days the captain was willing to forgo a part of his profit and even an expensive part of the ship—its tackle—in order to save their lives. What fear must they have had on the days after this when nothing could be thrown away anymore? The next verses explain that indeed ::their hopes were gone:: after "many" days. 

*20 When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.*

Time is in most cases the deciding factor when it comes to losing hope. In the first 24 hours there is still a chance of finding someone who has been kidnapped. After that, the odds slink dramatically. #todo/opzoeken After 72 hours the odds are almost zero. This was the case in a movie called #tags/movies *Taken*, where the daughter of the protagonist, played Liam Neeson #tags/famouspeople, is kidnapped. Seeing the almost inifinite number of possibilities of where she could be, by whom she could be kidnapped, and where she would be transported to after even another hour makes it nearly impossible to ever get anyone back. 

It is in these moments that God provides hope—not that He did not provide hope before these moments, He did, but the sailors the captain did not put their hope in Him, but rather in their own experience. When they realized, even after experienced mastering of the ship, that they could not even hoist the ship's boat or keep the ship pointing in the right direction, and gave up, and added a another three days of not even seeing any sun or stars, that is when they were broken. It took them eleven days of chaos plus another three days, which is 14 days to be broken. 
The number 11 is often associated with chaos in the Bible. We all know that God needs to break us, that is break our pride so that we can admit we need God, break our hearts, because our hardened hearts are useless and no seed can be planted there. Our pride is broken by the destruction of everything we have built up for ourselves; our hearts are broken by the destruction of everything we love resulting in a fear for many things. 
#todo/nogaftemaken 
built up: experience, career, etc. 
but we do not realize that it requires chaos to do all of these things. 

Right now, with corona, God is allowing chaos in this world, for what purpose? #todo/nogaftemaken 

*21 Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul stood up among them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and incurred this injury and loss. 22 Yet now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. 23 For this very night there stood before me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship, 24 and he said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.’ 25 So take heart, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told. 26 But we must run aground on some island.”*

::It was only after their hope was gone that Paul began to speak, or better yet that God began to speak to Paul.:: God has a time for everything and it is not surprising to see that in this story as well God comes as the proverbial *deus ex machina* as He does in our real lives as well. 
Of course it is impossible to tell why God comes at that moment, but it *seems* to be that God waits for the moment that people break down and realize they are worthless and powerless without God. The Pharaoh of the Ten Plagues had to go through ten plagues because this is what it took for him to realize that he could not go against the Lord Yahweh any longer. Unfortunately this was for but a short moment. Afterwards he still decided to go against God which cost him his life. God could have taken his life at the very beginning and even before the first plague for treating His children, that is the Israelites, the way he did. But God was merciful and gave him time and ten chances. 
We do not know what happened with the crew, the passengers and the other prisoners on the ship and whether they opened up their hearts to God. What we can say, though, is that God gave them a big chance. The Pharaoh did not realize his life had been preserved all this time, but the people on the ship knew their lives were preserved and would be saved by God. ::It is not sure whether all sailors believed this or completely believed this, for some wanted to escape and use their own way::, but at least the captain or the centurion believed this, for he commanded that the ropes of the ship's boat be cut in the next verses. 

~Those who believe God exist but who do not completely believe in the Gospel, that is they believe God can save them but they need to do some part of the work themselves as well.~

*27 When the ::fourteenth:: night had come, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land.*

It is not said when Paul came with his message of hope, but it gave them enough hope and with it peace to hold on until the fourteenth night. God's hope is a lasting hope. The words of Jeremiah still resound in this: *His steadfast love never ceases* (see also notes on [Jeremia 3:22ee](bear://x-callback-url/open-note?id=51277A70-2777-498B-9F4C-7B2A7371E612-2666-00001406FF751002)).

*28 So they took a ::sounding:: and found twenty fathoms. A little farther on they took a sounding again and found fifteen fathoms. 29 And fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come. 30 And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, and had lowered the ship's boat into the sea ::under pretense of laying out anchors:: from the bow,*

Is this done from outside of the ship? 

*31 Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.” 32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship's boat and let it go.*
*33 As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and without food, having taken nothing.*

Fourteen days without food.

*34 Therefore I urge you to take some food. For it will give you strength, for not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you.” 35 And when he had said these things, he took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat. 36 Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves. 37 (We were in all 276 persons in the ship.) 38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.*

***The Shipwreck***
*39 Now when it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, on which they planned if possible to run the ship ashore. 40 So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders. Then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach. 41 But striking a reef, they ran the vessel aground. The bow stuck and remained immovable, and the stern was being broken up by the surf. 42 The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any should swim away and escape.*

#biblestudy/questions Escape would have meant their death, but would the execution of the prisoners not have meant their deaths as well? 

*43 But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land, 44 and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all were brought safely to land.*
