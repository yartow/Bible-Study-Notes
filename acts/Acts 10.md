# Acts 10 
**Sermon notes** 
Paul disappeared from the scene after escaping from Damascus, for three years, being instructed by Jesus Himself #todo/opzoeken  
And after spending only 15 days in Jerusalem, he disappeared again for several years.  

Back to Peter, Simon the tanner was probably shunned because of his work with dead animals  

Aside from Cornelius, the Roman soldier, there was another Roman soldier in Jesus' time.  

If even the animals and reptiles cannot be called common or unclean, then people especially cannot be. Animals could be called unclean, however, but they could not be called unclean after God had made them clean again. As for people, this seems to be different, but see notes below.  

*Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.*
Is dit het thema?  

Vorige keer gehad over includering van heidenen en met name eunuchs. Nu over heidenen in het bijzonder.  
Ook over eten. Vorige keer gehad over bescherming van de Joden. Hoe heeft God ze beschermd? Met allerlei wetten, zoals  

* Andere kleding dragen 
* Ander soort eten eten 
* Kapsel 
* Hygiëne
* Besnijdenis 
* Rituelen voor spijtbetuiging. Hebben andere geloven dat? Zie je dat terug in het Boeddhisme of Hindoeïsme of in de Islam?  

Dit is niet alleen bedoeld om de Joden te beschermen, het is ook bedoeld geweest om de Joden apart te zetten. Van kleding bijvoorbeeld weten we niet wat de functie is. Het is zodat ze gescheiden zijn, zichtbaar en onzichtbaar, van de heidenen.  
Nu, nadat Jezus de opdracht heeft gegeven dat alle mensen tot Hem mogen komen, als ze in Hem geloven, mogen ook deze scheidingen weg.  
Sommige van deze scheidingen zijn nog steeds gezond.  

#todo/opzoeken dragen joden dit nog steeds?  


**Peter and Cornelius**
*At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort, a devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms generously to the people, and prayed continually to God.* 

A man who fears God fears Him so much that he not only believes what God is saying, He also does want God wants him to do. Even more, he will make sure that others do as God wishes because he knows that he is responsible for some others, but especially for his household.  
Another form is fear is to give generously to others. This is done out of love for God in the first place, and out of love for others in the second place, but it has to do with a fear of the Lord as well.  
A healthy fear means you do not want to do anything wrong. When one is in heaven and God asks you what you have done with all of your talents and gifts and material possessions, one will fear God in giving the wrong answer. The truth may be the wrong answer, for one knows that the answer should be that he has given everything to others and for himself only that which he needed.  
Therefore one who has much, needs to give more to others.  
Prayer to God is also part of fearing God. Why would anyone who fears his master have conversations with his master? I for one have never enjoyed conversations with my manager at work, because I assume every conversation as part of his judgment of mine, and it seemed to be the case in one of my jobs. I much rather be judged by my work than by my conversational or social skills.  
In God's case, He will not judge us by our works, for these will definitely not pass the perfection that God demands. But He is not going to judge us by our character either, through our conversations with Him, for these we would also not pass. Rather, in our conversations with God we show our hearts, our humility and our weakness. In our prayer requests we admit that we are not able to establish that which we want and we admit that God is able, and in doing so we praise Him. We show our dependence on Him by praying and that is how He judges our hearts, by our relationship with Him.  
Is it unlawful for a father to provide on the basis of how much He loves his child? If a father has one child, and he loves him in a certain measure, say 80, then it is logical that he provides his child with 80. Or do you think the father should provide his child with whatever it results it has? So if the child is disobedient, should it then not get any blessing from his father or food? 
Now the difficulty comes when the father has multiple children who have different relationships with their father. One seeks dependance while another does not seek a relationship with him. All will get the minimum care of food and lodging, for he is a good father. Would it now be unfair when the father gives a little extra to one of his children, not because he loves one child more than the other, but because one spends more time with him?. Suppose this child does an errand for his father, and the father gives him a little extra so that he may buy an popsicle after his errand, is it unfair of the father to do this and not give his other children the ice cream?  
Is it even unfair of this father to give this errand to this specific child and not to the others, who never ask to do errands or do not do them or do them joyfully? Of course the answer is clear here. The father has every right to reward his children however he pleases and doing it on the basis of relationship is not a wrong or unfair measuring stick.  

*About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in and say to him, “Cornelius.” And he stared at him in terror and said, “What is it, Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God.* 

When God speaks about heaven it is almost always in symbols because the language of heaven cannot be translated to an Earthly language. God speaks therefore of the book of life, but of course this is not literally a book, for in heaven there are more dimensions than here and books only exist in the three dimensional world.  
This memorial God is talking about, is not a stone such as the Lincoln Memorial, but it could be a symbolic stone standing in heaven, by which God "remembers" the things that Cornelius has done.  
Now note that a sacrifice as an atonement would most likely not be worthy of a memorial, for it would be, as the word says, an atonement for what we have done wrong to God. The only memorial there would be would be a memorial of how we have sinned against God. But Cornelius memorial here is of his deeds arising from unselfishness and great faith because he was a heathen. A heathen, like the eunuch perhaps and Ruth, who is willing to cast off his own god, leave his family and surrounding in order to live a life for God, is praised more by God than a Jew who had to do nothing to obtain his inheritance or lose anything to keep it.  
How great would it be to be remembered by God in heaven! This is a remembrance by God, and not by man, and in heaven, and not on Earth.  
How many people try to work on their legacy each day in order to be remembered after their deaths? Even I am, while I am writing this, hoping that my written work will pass the test of time. Others, like sportsmen, want to break records to be remembered forever and be written in the history books of sports.  
But little do they realize that even when it is written in the records, or annals, of sport's history, it is overwhelmed by the many other records.  
Which record in sport has never been unsurpassed? The fastest runner has been #todo/opzoeken/engels ingehaald caught up with a new one, such as Usain Bolt, who will most like be replaced by another one in a few years.  
The record for selling most musical hits or tickets in the cinema is one that is ever increasing, even though, strangely, the number of time we are allotted in a day has ever been the same.  
#todo opschrijven 16 uur per dag  
But the pioneers of the missionary field, they are remembered better than others. First of all because it is not something as irrelevant as the ticket box office of cinema, which few people care about but even fewer people have been helped with. It is irrelevant because there is no continued effect.  

World measurements to make a lifelong impact: 
* Relevance, Christian or secular?  

* Being the first. There is only a first time once. Like Neal Armstrong,... (even a world record is sort of a first)  

* Choosing the right category. Less competition, more danger, less success, less data, less overwhelming  


But still, though work in the missionary field would be scoring higher on all those points, it still would not reach the highest scores. How many people actually know these missionaries? #todo/opzoeken  Torchlighters examples  
They gave their lives, like many other nameless Christians have done. Would they then be remembered? Would you be able to find their tombstone among the hundreds of thousands to millions of tombstones of their remembrance?  

Therefore remembrance by man should not be our goal. Man will always forgot what any man has ever achieved, just like 
#tags/famouspeople/christian/missionaries Eric Lidell, who went to China, who had both secular world records and spiritual ones but was largely forgotten in the Cultural Revolution in China and his grave was literally hidden and overgrown with plants behind a small school.  

Take the greatest invention of all time, through Newton the law of gravity, which allowed for space travel, and through Einstein, space and quantum physics, which has allowed for the greatest inventions of all times, computers, satellites and the internet. How many people know this? A few, how many people actually care on a daily basis? None.  

If the greatest invention of all time, which fits these criteria better than any other thing man can ever do, then there is only other thing we can do. We change the subject to God instead of to man.  

First of all, we should not wish to be remembered by man. Man is fleeting #todo/opzoeken/engels vluchtig, zie Ecclesiastes, and will easily forgot. But the God Who has an infinite memory with an infinitely high number of exabytes will always remember every deed we have done.  

Second of all, we should change the criteria to what God wishes. I shall address two of these worldly criteria for stardom.  
The first one is: Do we impress God by choosing a specific category to work in? Do the people in the army or on the missionary battlefield, who risk their lives, receive more credits than those who stay at home and take care of their children or their elderly parents? ~More examples here~ 
The answer is no. God gives credit to those who love Him and please Him. #todo/opzoeken *but the LORD takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his steadfast love. Psalm 147:11 (ESV)* 

Can we become more relevant to Him by being the first in what we do? Now why would anyone want to be the first except for wanting to be the first in line, to receive the largest portion, the biggest credits or whatever slur one gives it? No, it is humility that God seeks. Micah 6:8  

No, I would even go further and say that no one can ever be the first for there is there is nothing new under the sun. Someone might be the first to go off to China, like Hudson Taylor was, or James Curry #todo/opzoeken/engels who was the first to go to India (but Timothy had gone to India before him), but was it really the first? Jesus was the first to come from another world into this world!  
No, instead of wanting to be the first we should aim for being the last. We should not go out to *seek* fame and glory for ourselves, but we should go out to *give* glory to Jesus everywhere!  
The first shall be the last #todo/opzoeken 

~~Lastly, should we be doing something more relevant? Should we get a spiritual job instead of a secular job?~~

Remembrance by God is what matters most.  

~Example of what one's spouse thinks of him is most important.~

Finding remembrance with God is the only thing in the world where it does not matter what you do or in whatever category.  

At the same time, whatever you, everything is relevant to Him, as long as you do it for Him.  

It is also the only thing that will not be overwhelmed by what others do because God will always see you. 

*And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.” When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him, and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.*

Now we have heard in the previous chapter that Simon Peter was living at Simon the tanner for many days. Did Peter deliberately chose him? Perhaps he did. Tanners in those days were quite lonesome people and kept distance from by the traditional and strict Jewish people. For tanners worked with dead animals and according to the Law of God one becomes unclean after touching dead animals.  
Being a tanner is a very hard work. In the book and #todo/opzoeken/engels verfilmde *Das Parfum* by Patrick #todo/opzoeken #tags/books it is explained that a specific tanner hired the protagonist named Grenouille because of his resistance against the acids that bite his skin. It involves putting pieces of animal skin together with toxic chemicals under the ground and waiting months for it before it becomes the smooth leather or suede we have for our shoes or even years before we have anything as soft as leather for our gloves. That is why when one goes into a clothing store to buy a belt, one will generally find that the softer the leather belt is the more expensive it is.  
Now we're these Jews justified in shunning Simon? It was part of the Law of Moses after all #todo/opzoeken referentie naar wet van shunning this person had to be done for a number of days until the person was clean again. But if a person kept doing this work, how could one ever get into contact with this person?  
I am of the opinion that the physical distance with Simon the Tanner here is not the problem, but the social distance. Rather yet, the term *social distance* exists even now #tags/historic events# and has taken a different meaning in this time during the COVID-19. It is now by law that a social distance of 1.5 meters is compulsory in all closed and public areas such as restaurants, supermarkets and libraries, and wherever this is not possible they have instituted the compulsory use face masks.  
Is there a physical distance between the people? Yes, when one cannot shake hands or hug, and has to keep 1.5 meters distance this physical distance exists indeed; but with facial masks on and a fear of touching people one should try having a conversation with the other.  
Vragen twee mensen naar voren te komen en te praten 
As a matter of fact, I could even order something at the restaurant with my mask on either because the waiter could not hear me or I could not hear him.  
During my holiday in Italy I was alone in a café #todo/opzoeken/engels when I saw an African man on the street who held out his hat to collect some change. I invited him over for some coffee instead of giving him money. It turned out to be that he was Nigeria and that, fortunately, he could speak English, albeit with a Nigerian accent. I can tell you that it was a very strange feeling to start a conversation with a stranger in front of you, wearing a mask, and to me almost completely incomprehensible, especially when a person is a meter away from you and speaking with a soft voice.
The governments of this world should have called this measure physical distance, but instead they have called it *social distance* as if they knew or wanted people to become socially distant as well.  

But how about God's Law then? Was it His intention that tanners or coroners #todo/opzoeken/engels lijkschouwers would be shunned for the rest of their lives or that nobody should ever do this work?  

No, social distance was mentioned by Paul for a person in sin, but it was always meant to be done in order to let the sinner realize his sins and miss his church family, so that the sinner would repent and be forgiven and accepted into the community again.  

I do not have an answer to this difficult question. All I know is that God wanted His people to be different for ceremonial reasons. This rule was part of the ceremonial law which was cancelled out after Jesus' resurrection. Can we find this clearly in the Bible?

**Peter's Vision**
*The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray. And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth. In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air. And there came a voice to him: “Rise, Peter; kill and eat.” But Peter said, “By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.” And the voice came to him again a second time, “What God has made clean, do not call common.” This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.*

What God has made clean, do not call common. God was clearly referring to the animals here and that these have been made clean. Even in the time of Abraham, Abraham already knew the difference between clean and unclean animals, as did Noah, before the Law of Moses was given.  
After the flood we see that God allowed us to eat the animals as well, which means that before the flood man was only allowed to eat vegetables and fruits and nuts and seeds. After this great event in which God destroyed most of mankind of that time and only kept the select, His rule changed.  
This time, after an event even more important than the Flood which concerns even more people than only the people living in this time, but rather of all ages, which does not only concern people dying but sending them to hell, life vs afterlife, which is Jesus' death and resurrection, God changed the rules concerning food and other things again.  

So God gave Adam rules, which he changed after the Flood, and He gave new ones after the Exodus, after the people were saved. Rules fitting for a people He selected.  
This time, after another Exodus where not only the Israelites are saved, but all of mankind, God gives new and fitting rules again for His people, that is the Christians.  
Whereas the first rules were to separate His people from the nations, they have now become such that the nations can join His people. This only goes for customary rules, however, not for moral rules.  

Why would God change the rules?  
Why would God make something clean again? Can He make people clean again then as well?  
God has never called the heathens unclean and the rules about touching a Gentile or eating from the same bowl have always arrived from human thoughts, not by Law. So God did not have to make Gentiles clean.  
I like the translation that says that Peter called the food common, so not unclean but merely common. If this was about people if would be as if special people should only eat with special ones and not with commoners. This is wrong of course because it indicates that you yourself are more special than others. #todo/opzoeken Griekse vertaling.  
But note that it is about food, not people.  

*Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood at the gate and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there. And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are looking for you. Rise and go down and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them.” And Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the one you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?” And they said, “Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say.” So he invited them in to be his guests.*

It was clear to Peter that the vision was related to three Gentiles looking for him, and he knew that he should not reject them but invite them in as guests, which also means that they should eat and sleep together, things that Jews would not have done with Gentiles in that time.  
Peter knew from the example that concerned *food*, that the barriers to *humans* should be broken as well, though these had never been imposed by God but by man himself.  
The Holy Spirit had not descended on the Gentiles before, except for perhaps the guy riding the donkey #todo/opzoeken, and possibly touched Ruth, Rahab and Naaman #todo/opzoeken Elisha.  

*The next day he rose and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him. And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him. But Peter lifted him up, saying, “Stand up; I too am a man.” And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered. And he said to them,*

How strange it is to see that the in secular terms *superior* people, the Romans, because they were the one who conquered the Israelites, have brought many among them to see a Jew, one of the inferior ones, and that Cornelius even knelt before him and worshipped him. Cornelius was so under the impression of God that he did not have any low or high regard #todo/opzoeken Vers over lage kijk naar mensen vanwege kleding  
To the person or the ethnicity, but only to God and to those who are from God.  
Actually, it is the Jews here who are superior in spiritual terms, because they were the ones God had chosen (cf. Colossians 3:12) but who have to learn from these Gentiles who fearlessly visited and entered Simon's house and who were not ashamed to lay down their Roman and worldly pride for a man of God.  

*“You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean.* 

#todo/opzoeken unlawful in Grieks, was this really unlawful? 
Even though Peter only called the food common or unclean, God knew that Peter was talking about people.  
**Example.** As a little boy of four years old I once told a little Moroccan girl to move aside so I could have some more space. My teacher said I could not treat people like that just because she was Moroccan. I said I only said it to have a little more space, but the teacher knew my heart and that I did not like foreign people.  

In God's eyes there are no unclean people. So when God was talking about the people when he referred to animals, was He also talking people when He referred to making things clean? Would that mean then that the Gentiles were unclean but have now been made clean?  
Looking at world history, most of the detestable idolatry with child sacrifices by that time had been removed from this world, although a very pagan and sexually immoral Greco-Roman religion had taken its place.  
I do not think, however, that the severity of sin is what makes man clean or unclean and that God decided to let people under the Roman religion join His people simply because all idolatries were less severe than the previous Persian and Babylonian ones.  

So if God actually meant making people clean again, I would not know what that means, except for when this happens through the Holy Spirit. But if God was only referring to animals when said "making clean", He would have had two intentions: join the Gentiles and eat their meat.  

*So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me.” And Cornelius said, “Four days ago, about this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God. Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.’ So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.”*

Cornelius sent him, even though God did not say why. Ananias, a Jew, obeyed God after resisting first, and another guy did the same thing #todo/opzoeken Even Peter rejected God's commands, but a Gentile here obeys God without even asking why.  
Just like the Roman officer whom Jesus met and about whom Jesus said that He had not seen such a great faith in all of Israel #todo/opzoeken it was a Gentile who received the praise.  
Jews are not worth more or better than Gentiles or the other way around, it is each person's heart that God looks at.  

Cornelius here explains what what thinks why God sent him, which is to hear God's commands. Although Peter did not receive and explicit command, except for an imperative to eat what was in the cloth, he now understood what the *underlying* command was.  

**Gentiles Hear the Good News**
*So Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.*

Why would there be a "but" here? The second part of the sentence corresponds to the first. The "but" would indicate that God does show some kind of partiality by distinguishing between those who fear Him and those who do not.  

*As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear, not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”* 

It is important to mention that the core of the Gospel is mentioned here. Whenever we go out and speak to non Christians we cannot tell them the whole story of Matthew, Mark, Luke or John, but we can tell them the core.  
The core is that we are sinful and Jesus died for us on the cross. But God raised Him so that... we could receive forgiveness of sins through Jesus' Name.  
This is where things get different from other religions.  
Take for example the Islamic faith. Our Bible tells us that all the prophets bear witness that whoever believes in God will be forgiven. We see that in the Bible multiple prophets refer to Jesus, such as Moses and Isaiah, although it is not clear in all of the prophets, but forgiveness, indeed, most of the prophets indicate that that is possible with God.  
The Quran does not make this statement that the previously revealed books, which they call the Gospel and the Torah, are pointing towards Muhammed, their Prophet. Many commentators or Islam Apologists might do so, but they are practicing eisegesis here and making things up which contradict each other.  
Another important thing is that the prophecy of Jesus' resurrection was witnessed, indeed not to the whole world, but to at least the 11 disciples, and later on many more during forty days. These disciples and other people could have contradicted each other in their testimonies. Muhammad received his revelation while he was alone and that was it. There is no one to corroborate or to support him.  
The testifying of Jesus' divinity is also different from the truthfulness of Muhammad's prophecy. The disciples testified with their lives by living a holy life, humble and poor, helping others everywhere they could. Muhammad on the other hand lived a life in abundance, both sexually, monetary and in terms of power, and was the opposite of humility when it came to many things in life.  

Lastly though, and most importantly, the disciples preached the Gospel to proclaim that forgiveness is possible and only possible through Jesus' Name. Muhammad and his disciples proclaimed that Allah is the only God and Muhammed is his prophet, and that if you do certain things you will get rewards in heaven. What does that religion say about mankind? It says nothing about its sinfulness. It only speaks about rewards. But in Christianity it is all about sinfulness, because on the opposite of sin is God's holiness. And God is more than holiness, do not get me wrong, God is also love and righteousness, and grace and mercy. But it is through all of His being, that is because He loves us He wants a relationship with us, but because He is righteous He needs to punish sin, but because He is gracious He gives us His mercy, by sending His own Son, Jesus Christ, to Earth, all so that we can be pulled away from sin and all sin will rest on Jesus' shoulders.  
One of the main aspects of the Gospel is our sinfulness. I am not saying the Gospel is about sin, it is about God's love for the world. But we cannot leave sin out of the Gospel, because if we do, we we must leave out forgiveness as well.

**The Holy Spirit Falls on the Gentiles**
*While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word.* 

Cornelius had brought together his relatives and close friends, most likely people who also believed in God, for usually that is the case when a godly man is invited, although it could also be that he invited those whom he wanted to introduce to God but could not have done himself, as we often do when a famous evangelist passes our town or congregation to hold a series of sermons.  
It was clear that the listeners already knew of Jesus' crucifixion, as Peter says in verse 37, but it is likely that they did not know of the events that happened in verse 40 and later on. Most importantly are the parts in verse 42 and 43, where the core of the Gospel is proclaimed, namely that Jesus is the Judge and that there is forgiveness through Jesus for everyone who believes in Him.  
Regardless of their belief in God and their respect for God, this part they needed to *know,* before they would receive the Holy Spirit permanently—and the knowing came through the hearing of the Word.  

*And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles. For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God.* 

The speaking in tongues was a proof of the descension #todo/opzoeken/engels and indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The circumcised believers were amazed about that. Apparently and clearly they had not interpreted the message clearly when Jesus told them to go out into the world and baptize everyone. Perhaps they were thinking of the Jews all around the world.  

Now as for tongues. This was a phenomenon that was needed at Pentecost to show the Jewish people from around the world the power of the Holy Spirit and to let them hear the Gospel in their own language in case they did not understand Hebrew. But why was it necessary here? Was it to reflect that event and to show the circumcised believers that they too had the Holy Spirit?  
Or was it merely the extolling of God and the proclamation of the Gospel in their own language, for Cornelius, though being Roman, could have been Turkish, Spanish or of any other part in the Roman empire with its own language, just like their relatives and friends. Each one could have proclaimed the Gospel then and there, but that would not have been a miracle, because they already knew that language. It might have been a miracle if all of a sudden they were able to proclaim it in Hebrew, so that the Jews could verify this, for if they were to say it in another language, they would not.  

*Then Peter declared, “Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?” And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.* 

Notice that it is not clear whether these people were submersed in water or that only a bit of water was put on their heads. They were still at Cornelius' house it seems and I do not suppose there is enough water present to be submersed in. There was water nearby in Caesarea, but concerning the circumstances of Christian persecution it is doubtful whether they baptized Cornelius' household there. I would also say that when Peter asked if anyone could "withhold" water it meant something like whether anyone has water to spare.  
This is not a case for arguing that baptisms should be done in this way, nor is the case for Philip's baptism of the eunuch an argument. In this case it was the fastest and safest way to do this, in the eunuch's case it would seem wiser to be baptized in natural water, be it a sea or oasis, than to deplete one's own source of water. I have heard of Christians in the arena, right before being eaten by the lions or dogs, baptizing those who had not been baptized before with sand, by putting a little of it on their heads.  
Is there a case then to be made for normal situations when water is plentiful and persecution is absent?  
The Chinese church I attended made an argument against that. Although both water was present and persecution was absent, there was a fear of the older generation, and misunderstanding that immersions in water are only done by pentecostal churches. The older generation was afraid that our church would become that. Now the argument can be refuted for the reason that it is the church leadership's job to educate the congregation, but would fear stil be an argument?  
In this case I would simply say that one does not need to make an argument. An argument is only needed when something must be done a certain way. If one prefers to be baptized by immersion, and another by the dripping of water, let him be baptized in his preferred way.  
If a church is arguing that immersions must happen because Jesus and John the Baptist did it in that way, then realize that that was most common in that time and that situation where water was scarce.  
If one argues that the word for baptism in Hebrew or Greek means complete immersion and the symbol is a complete immersion in God's grace, then let the listener understand that the baptism itself is the symbol, albeit a compulsory ritual, and not the object or form itself. Just like a marriage is the symbol with which we obey God's command, and is therefore compulsory, and not the ring or the color of the dress.  
We do not know Jesus intention exactly when He told us to be baptized. Did He mean merely the baptism or also baptism in the way like He was baptized? Suppose there is no word for baptism in a specific language and this word is translated as "to be immersed", suppose that Jesus said His command in this language, would it then mean that one has to be fully immersed in order for him to obey the command? I would think not. It only depends on Jesus' intention and we cannot know that. We do know, however, that this is a not required for salvation and hence the matter should be approached with less strictness than the more important matters.
