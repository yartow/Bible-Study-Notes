# Acts 8 (MBP) 
**Saul Ravages the Church** 
*1 And Saul approved of his execution.* 
*And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. 2 Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him. 3 But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison.* 

Again in verse 3 we find the word "but" which indicates that the verse before it is different from this one. In verse 3 Saul was *ravaging* the church, so we would expect the verse 2 to contain the opposite of ravaging, which is *building up*, but verse 2 "only" tells us that men were burying Stephen and making great lamentation, which is crying and grieving. 
Burying a member of your congregation and lamenting over him, even though you are losing a member, you are still building up the church. How can we build up the church with a common thing like that and how can we build it up when we lose people? 
Lamenting is the showing of true grievance and love for this person. Those who do not lament, perhaps because they did not know the dead one well, can still comfort the survivors, which is an expression of love for them. It is through love and the expression thereof that the church is built up. Everywhere in the New Testament we see that where the disciples love other people, such as the lame and sick, people come to Christ. As mentioned before, it is the Holy Spirit Who works here, not our love per se , but the Holy Spirit filled them after they prayed in *unity* which is characterized by love. Examples of newly converts in the absence of love do not exist. Even if the newly convert only saw a vision of God, like Muslims often do and like Paul did, they can feel and realize God's love for them. 

The second question is how the church can be built up when it loses members. We see this happening all the time in the persecuted Church, that is that congregations in northern and central (west and east) Africa, practically all of East Asia, except for the Westernized countries such as Hong Kong (which has now become a city of China), Taiwan, Singapore and South-Korea, and Thailand as an exception. The number of people in their congregation is not declining per se  when people are being sent to prison, because in prison this person can Evangelize and make even more members. Now these members may join a different congregation, so the congregation would become smaller, but the Church would become bigger. 
How do we explain then when a member dies, before he got the chance to Evangelize? The situation in which one dies are more significant than one thinks. First of all, quite often a person does not die directly, but still has a few last words. By the expression of love through words such as "Forgive them, Father, for they do not know what they are doing" or during the beheading of 21 Egyptians Coptic Christians in Libya in 2015 #tags/historic events# , recorded on video and gone viral over the world—however, not heard of within the secular community—when one of the Christians told the guard about Christ and why he wanted to die for him, the guard himself came to Christ at that moment. I have read somewhere that the guard kneeled there as well and offered his life to God. #todo/opzoeken  verify where it was written, see

**Philip Proclaims Christ in Samaria** 
*4 Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word. 5 Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ. 6 And the crowds with one accord paid attention to what was being said by Philip, when they heard him and saw the signs that he did. 7 For unclean spirits, crying out with a loud voice, came out of many who had them, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. 8 So there was much joy in that city.* 

In verse 1 it seems like all the Christians were scattered because they were afraid. Perhaps some were, but it is made clear in verse 4 that they were scattered to preach the Word. Now of course it is brave to stay where one is despite an ongoing persecution, but it is also wise to leave when it is not necessary to stay and when one can help elsewhere with spreading the Gospel. 
We can see what the effect was when Philip went out. People paid attention to his message, people came to faith and people were healed. It does not say in this part that people came to faith but I am assuming that. I am mentioning this, because even if people did not come to faith, but did pay attention to his message, it would still change them in some way. 
Now by attention I do not mean merely mean listening well. I am sure that atheists such as Richard Dawkins  #tags/famouspeople have listened very carefully or even read the Bible very carefully, but they have not done that with an open mind. 
In a debate with Kent Hovind #tags/famouspeople one professor (a biology teacher in college) Hovind listed all kinds of arguments against evolution. The biology teacher must have listened to those, but instead of answering these valid arguments, he read out a Christian pamphlet saying that the Fall caused atoms to become radioactive. Now this is not true of course and I am sure that the pamphlet did not mean that literally or as a scientific explanation. But even if so, the goal of a debate is to answer each other's questions, not to mock each other. In this case I would say that the biology teacher was not paying attention to what Hovind said. 

What is also worth mentioning is that people paid attention *after* they saw the signs Philip did. God does not do miracles to make people believe in them. If that were the case, then every instance of a miracle would have brought each viewer to conversion. It is the miracle that brings people to stop and pay attention. After being attentive, they will hear the message and it is then the Word of God that will bring conversion to some. 
Dawkins himself in an interview said that no miracle could make him believe in God, because a hallucination would be a more probable explanation for that. But still, if Dawkins were ever to see a miracle—and I do not think he will, for why would God bother when Jesus did not even do miracles in Nazareth (cf. Matthew 13:58), because the people there did not and would not believe in Him—he *might* start paying attention to what is actually being said in the Bible. 

**Simon the Magician Believes** 
*9 But there was a man named Simon, who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was somebody great. 10 They all paid attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is the power of God that is called Great.” 11 And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic. 12 But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 13 Even Simon himself believed, and after ::being baptized:: he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed.* 

We should make notice of the fact that Simon had been practicing magic for a long time. This idolatrous practice where one is in contact with the powers of evil, and the things that accompany it, such as arrogance (he said about himself that he was great), had been long imbued in the person. 
Even though Simon believed the good news, he was not fully converted of his wickedness and his wrong attitude before God, as Peter told him to *repent* in verse 22. 
It is not a matter of duration, however, for a true conversion due to hearing the Gospel can change a person of its past sin regardless of the size of his sin. But perhaps it is a matter of understanding and willingness to commit to Jesus. 
Clearly Simon did not understand God and that He cannot be bought with money. What is also clear is that Simon did not commit his way of getting things, which was with money as he most likely was rich due to his former practices. 
In my previous life, before I was a Christian that is, I also did wrong things such as wanting to date girls only for physical lust. After I was baptized, I continued doing these things, but looking in hindsight, I do not think I was actually converted back then, it was years later before I would truly recommit myself to Jesus. 
In this case, however, I cannot say the same for Simon, because he believed Philip's words—if I may assume the belief in verse 13 is the same as that of verse 12, for it could be that in verse 13 the people believed the Gospel and in verse 12 Simon believed merely that God exists or something like that. How can anyone who believes the Gospel then still be baptized while not having fully repented of his sin? The only reason why I was still baptized regardless of my sin, is because the pastor who baptized me could not look into my heart and see my true intentions. 
Philip, however, was anointed and filled with the Holy Spirit in such a way that he could do miracles. Could he not have seen Simon's true intentions as Peter did both later in this chapter and in the case with Ananias and Sapphira? 
If we may take Simon's request for prayer in verse 24 at face value and interpret that as a call for forgiveness, then I can understand why Philip allowed him to be baptized, and that would be because Simon's intentions were good. 

Summarizing, there are several explanations then for the events happening in this part. We may assume that Philip knew the hearts of the people or that he did not, which would lead to different interpretations then. 

In the case Philip *could not* read the hearts of people, we have the following scenarios: 
1. Philip thought Simon's conversion was real. 

In the case Philip *could* read the hearts of people, we have the following scenarios: 
2. Philip knew Simon's heart was not right, but his intentions were good. 
	1. God allows for some changes after baptism. That is, a partial conversion is sufficient for baptism. 
	2. God only allows complete conversions before baptism. In this case we have another two scenarios. 
		1. Simon was completely converted, but his understanding of God was not complete. -> we know from verse 19 that this is not correct. Simon was aware of his own bad intentions, but perhaps he was not fully aware of the seriousness of his sin. This has nothing to do with an understanding of God, however. 
		2. "Repent" in verse 22 is different from "conversion" as implied by the word "believe" in verse 13. Repentance would then refer to the daily repentance Christians have, while conversion would be a one-off thing. Conversion would mean that a person is really willing to change, but that he cannot always do so and still sins at times. 
Perhaps it should be noted that Simon had not received the Holy Spirit then and so Philip (on behalf of God) was a little bit milder in his judgement of who would qualify for baptisms. 
In these days people convert and receive the Holy Spirit before they are baptized and a minister tests the person to his best effort to see whether he really has converted and received the Holy Spirit. But back then his conversion would only be a change in his will, without the full power of the Holy Spirit and discernment could be harder. In any case, I would say it would be different from how it is done right now. 

Another thing concerning verse 13, why was Simon amazed by all these miracles? He would have been able to perform some of these miracles as a magician as well, unless he was a hoax or a magician in the sense of current day's "magicians" who use gimmicks and and sleight-of-hand tricks, which I doubt existed in those days. Of course, he could not have cast out demons like in verse 7, because that would be going against the devil's own kingdom. 
My guess is that it was the character of these miracles. Surely people would have been amazed at Simon's magic, but if he could only create fireworks or make things levitate, it would not make people as happy as when they were healed. So he would have seen the difference in happiness between his customers and the people who experience the miracles of God performed by Philip. 
Another possibility is that Simon did perform healing miracles, but made large amounts of money, while Philip did all this for free. It would then be both Philip's humble heart as well as the healed people's attitudes, for they received something without having given anything—for a person who has been healed for free, is happy in a much different way than one who has had to pay a large sum for it. 

*14 Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, 15 who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, 16 for he had not yet fallen on any of them, ::but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.::* 

This is one thing I am really wondering about: why was the Holy Spirit given after the baptism instead of before? In the time of John the Baptist this was clear. It was a symbol of one who openly repented and who had to be symbolically cleansed. After Jesus had come, it became more than that, because it had the above meanings but also the meaning to be intimately connected to Jesus now, as His bride. Now a person falls in love before he marries his spouse, so a Christian should convert before he is baptized and with conversion comes the Holy Spirit. 
Is it not the Spirit who convicts us to repent where upon repenting we want to show the world our repentance and the surrendering of our lives and submission to God through this baptism? Yes it is. But this is a special case, as *MacSBNnkjv* explains. Both here in the case of the conversions of the Samaritans and in the case of the conversion of the Gentiles, the Holy Spirit had to come in the presence of the apostles to show the authenticity of the Samaritans' conversion and inclusion into God's family. If this had not been done, the Jews or the Jewish Christians might think that the Samaritan Christians merely wanted to join the Christians, just like they wanted to be accepted by the Jews. But with the testimony of the apostles it was clear for everyone that the conversion within the Samaritan people was authentic (perhaps with the exception of Simon). 

*17 Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. 18 Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, 19 saying, “Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.” 20 But Peter said to him, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!* 

Is it not cruel to wish someone to perish simply because he thought he could obtain anything from God through money? If Simon were naïve then it would be harsh of Peter to say such a thing to him, but we know that Peter has the ability, although not perse the gift, to discern Simon's true motives, because Peter says in verse 23 that he can see it. 
Simon had ill intentions indeed but Peter's words shook him up, so these harsh words are allowed to be said by a Christian in order to wake up someone. 
I will assume—with less certainty though—that Simon earnestly asked for prayer in verse 24, just like Ahab feared the outcome of his sins and truly repented. According to *MacSBNnkjv*, however, this request for prayer is not authentic and perhaps he bases that on the word of the early church fathers who wrote about Simon as the father of the Gnostics. #todo/opzoeken is this really true? 

*21 You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.* 

It is extremely important that one's heart is right before God. It is not so much the type or size of the sin that matters, but one's heart before God. Once again, simply asking a question is not wrong when one is unknowing. Asking something without thinking first is worse. But when one knows it is sin and still *wants* to sin, even if it is for good purposes, because Simon wanted to use it to give the Holy Spirit to others, it is a grave sin because one willingly and knowingly goes against God's wishes. 

*22 ::Repent::, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you. 23 For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.” 24 And Simon answered, “Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.”* 
*25 Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.* 

**Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch** 
*26 Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” This is a desert place.* 

Philip preached the gospel to many villages in the northern region of Israel, also called Samaria, but verse 25 does not say whether he was successful there. 
Verse 26 says that it was a desert place. Now it was not the angel who said that, but Luke, so we have to interpret this in a different way because it is outside of the parentheses. If this part were inside parentheses it that the angel meant that the remaining villages in Samaria were desert places or in other words, places with no potential for conversion and that that was the reason why Philip had to leave. 
Assuming, however, that the translation is correct and that this was not said by the angel, it probably means that Luke said the place where Philip had to go to, south of the road, was a desert place. The relevance of this is that Philip ::could not know:: what his purpose was for going there. A location can tell you something about a purpose. If any one of us is called to a poor island of the Philippines and we knew of the garbage dumps, #todo/opzoeken/engels sloppenwijken, slums and contaminated water, we could probably guess that God wanted us to build healthy and clean schools, hospitals and other facilities along with spreading the Gospel. 
If an angel told us to go to a rich Muslim country such as Dubai or Brunei we would guess it was to convert Muslims. But something ambiguous as a desert place along a road could of course mean spreading the Gospel to any person on that road, but to whom? Apparently it was a desert place because not many people travelled there, otherwise shops would have opened alongside the road. It would not have been very attractive either to go to a 
 * a far place
 * without water or shadow
 * with possibly a long waiting time
*  with no idea of what to do.

Either way, Philip listened to the angel. This of course is the easiest thing to do. If only we had angels to tell us what to do, we would give up our jobs, sell our houses and move abroad into the missionary field—but it is always the call we do not hear clearly. 
Martin Lloyd-Jones #tags/famouspeople also said that he, but also other preachers, felt a weight on their hearts to give up their career and go into ministry. This weight got so heavy that they had to give into it. I assume he did not give into it, because the weight, when it was still light, was not clear enough to be discerned as a call from God or to discern what God was actually saying—aside from the fact that a call needs to be repeated sometimes for humans to be willing enough to give up their material possessions and careers. Would it not have been much easier for Lloyd-Jones and the like to have had an angel beside him to tell him what to do? He would have made the choice much quicker then. 
Perhaps so, but it would have taken the chance from him to show when he would listen. Now some preachers would listen to God when the weight is 10 kgs, while others would when it is 100 kgs and thus almost unbearable. This weight shows our stubbornness and perhaps will even carry this unbearable weight for years, before they finally give in, if ever at all. But if they do, they will also see the joy of following the Lord with all of their hearts *and their life* and realize how much they have missed by carrying this weight instead of giving in to God's call directly. It will also give them the chance to repent for neglecting God's call for so long. 
One could say it is an alternative way of communicating God's wishes or demands with more mercy. Disregarding an angel's words would be disregarding God Himself and punishment would be inflicted almost directly, as in the case of Jonah #todo/opzoeken engel die tot Jonah sprak? 
and Zachariah, John the Baptist's father. We should not say it in this way, though, because the amount of grace, even in the two examples given, is immeasurably great. Jonah was spared and even given a child-like example with a growing plant, that God put there to explain to him His thoughts. Zachariah was spared in an unbelievable way. Though he did not believe the angel—which means he did not believe God—while he was in the Holy of Holies—and we know that that is place where one should most careful and respectful of God's presence—and while being a High Priest, chosen and educated for all of his life, he only suffered a short period of muteness. How great the mercy of God is! 
Back to the story, for Philip it was apparently not necessary to use this way of communicating, but the direct form through an angel was best. Philip obeyed instantaneously, perhaps also because he had to be right there to cross the Ethiopian's path at the right time. 
We see that he was not late or too early, for he found him and after explaining to him the Gospel it seems they came to some water. Now this could have been the Mediterranean—if they had actually gone to the Gaza—or the Jordan, if he went in the direction of Ethiopia. Although the river is long, so it would not have mattered whether Philip was done explaining or not, because he would have had enough time before they would reach the end of the Dead Sea, it seems like the water came in just in time, like God always does things just in time—never too early or too late. 

*27 And he rose and went. And there was an Ethiopian, a ::eunuch::, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure.* 

It is remarkable to see how of all people God chose a very influential person to be the first among his people to hear the Gospel. Sheba was a queen of the south, which might also have been Ethiopia or a bigger area called Nubia, containing Ethiopia—who possibly has heard of Yahweh through Solomon, but not the Gospel itself—and this Ethiopian was a treasurer, in charge of all treasure, which must have been a great amount if we look at the resources that country has #todo/opzoeken . Paul too, who was elected by God, was a student of Gamaliel with outstanding credits and being a Roman citizen on top of that. 
In present days many missionaries have been chosen who were top students such as Ravi Zacharias (Oxford), Josh McDowell (Wharton), David Pawson (Oxford, England), Martin Lloyd-Jones (#todo/opzoeken ) and Hudson Taylor (?). 
God frequently uses farmers and people who were not good at studying to preach the Gospel as He has done with Dwight L. Moody #tags/famouspeople but He does not do so exclusively. He does not neglect the talents He has given us and of both people on the spectrum we can say that it is only by election and grace that we achieve something. #biblestudy/theology/predestination/election
In the case of Joseph, son of Jacob, we see clearly that God put him there for a reason. He did not achieve this because of his talents, but because of his faithfulness in God that he God decided to use his talents. I do not know much about the personal lives of the people mentioned above, but I do know that God gave them talents, and because they wanted to serve God, He put them in special positions to be able to reach people around the world. #todo/nogaftemaken 
But when these people are in special positions, God gives them special tasks and functions as well. 

*He had come to Jerusalem to worship 28 and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah.* 

First the Samaritans, later the Gentiles, but now eunuchs as well who were not allowed to become part of the people of Israel. Jesus tore the veil that separated the Israelites from God, but He also tore a veil that separated the Israelites from the heathens and the pagans. 
Now we must distinguish between the two. It is one thing to be of a different family, but it is another thing when someone is doing things against this family. 
Now in those days everyone was a worshipper or another god, so in that sense everyone was a pagan as well. But even then there were people who were simply following the status quo or worshipping their ancestors' gods and those who were consecrated to it. Among the latter were eunuchs, just like Nazirites and priests were consecrated. 
What God asked of Nazirites was never to drink alcohol, cut their hair or touch dead animals or people, or in other words, to stay clean. Something similar was asked of priests although the Bible does not specifically mention the lifestyle, but only the rites before their service  #todo/opzoeken . Eunuchs, however, had to be castrated, either by cutting off the testicles or by letting them die by tying them up. Perhaps even the whole penis was cut off. This is a detestable practice according to God #todo/opzoeken waar in de Bijbel? Not only because one is doing it for a fake god, but also because God's command is to be fruitful and multiply, because God imbued it in mankind's nature to procreate and now we go against God's command and we go against nature, which is also to go against God's command. 

*29 And the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over and join this chariot.” 30 So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet*

Philip did not know what he had to do when he was being sent from Samaria the south of Jerusalem. He had to walk a large distance and walk for days without knowing what to do and why to do this. All he knew, was that the angel told him to do this so apparently God wanted him to do that. 
It was only when he was in the *vicinity* of his goal that the Spirit—and not the angel—told Philip to join the chariot. Only when he was *next* to the chariot within hearing distance, which must have been very nearby when the chariot was making a lot of noise—which horses and carts do—did Philip know that it was an unbeliever who was reading from Isaiah. 
Sometimes we need to forget about ourselves and stop asking questions. Sometimes God is merciful enough to give us a clearer sound, as through an angel, when the distance is further, and sometimes God makes the sound less distinct, as from the Spirit—if I may interpret it that way—from the inside, when we are closer. But we should not stop because we do not know what to do anymore. When we are close enough we will hear the reason why we have to move, which in this case was to save a lost and searching soul. 
This may be very uncomfortable. Philip had to be close to the big horses and cartwheels of the chariot. Being so close to those things, while wearing sandals and while running, can be a scary feeling. One mistake and you could be crushed by the hoofs or the wheels. 
But this is always how it feels. The closer you get to God’s purpose, the scarier it gets. A friend of mine who often evangelizes on the streets told me that even after many successes and experience of evangelizing on the streets, he is still nervous every time, before he picks up the microphone and starts preaching. But as soon as he preaches the words will flow out of his mouth and then wonderful things happen. He has testimonies about drunken people who changed and demon-possessed people who clearly did not want to hear the voice of Jesus. But still, right before the action starts, there is always this tension. 
Another friend of mine in church says he is tensed before every sermon. This is logical. Who would not be tensed if he were to preach from God’s Word, the Holiest book of the Bible, coming from the people inspired by God Himself, Who spoke the Words and redacted the text Himself? Anyone not being tensed would not realize the holiness and size of what he is doing—and anyone not realizing this would not be worthy or preaching it, for the message he preached, would not contain the awe for God’s Word that is needed. Even the famed pianist #tags/famouspeople Vladimir Horowitz was tensed, up to the verge of literally vomiting—and he had done so—even while he was the best pianist of the world—at that time and even still remains so undefeated—eventually ending up in mental or psychiatric hospital due to nervous breakdowns only to largely—but never completely—recover from his tension years later and get back on the stage—and that was for something far less great as preaching the Word!—although it may not have been to him, although being a (secular) Jew. 

*and asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?” 31 And he said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. 32 Now the passage of the ::Scripture that he was reading was this:::* #todo/opzoeken -> exact hetzelfde? 
*“Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter* 
*and like a lamb before its shearer is silent,* 
*so he opens not his mouth.* 
*33 In his humiliation justice was denied him.* 
*Who can describe his generation?* 
*For his life is taken away from the earth.”* 

We see many coincidences in this piece about the exact time and location and attributes that God puts on our path. Philip was right on time at the right location to meet the chariot; the eunuch bought the right scroll God wanted him to read about—although there are other books of the Bible that also tell about Jesus, though none as clear about Jesus' sacrifice as this one—and Philip was right on time to catch the eunuch reading from Isaiah 51:7. Any time before that and he would have ruined the moment. Any time afterwards and the moment would not be hot. It was at this time that the eunuch was reading it and pondering over it. Also, at another time the eunuch would probably have read something else. 

::Conclusion: Do not wait.:: 

*34 And the eunuch said to Philip, “About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?” 35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus.*

Elsewhere in the Bible it says that the spreading of the Gospel starts with hearing it #todo/opzoeken  and in order to hear it someone needs to tell it. So it is good that Philip opened his mouth here. 
Some Evangelization theories say that Christians need to build bridges first before spreading the Gospel so that their susceptibility to the Gospel is more effective. Now I do think we should find a fine balance here. Some things could indeed severely hamper one's susceptibility to the Gospel. However, on one hand we see that if people are working hard only to make ends meet and someone asks them for some time to hear the Gospel, they will not have this time for if they do not work, they will not get paid. On the other hand, William Booth and John Wesley were in these kind of situations, but still there were people who listened to and received the Gospel. Those who were susceptible despite their hunger or perhaps due to their hopelessness in life heard it and became followers of Christ. 
Would William Booth have become more effective if he had built relationships with the bar owners and their friends? Perhaps he would have had less resistance during his tent meetings and perhaps the fight between the bar owners and the Christians would have been prevented. But for sure William Booth would have had less time to even hold these tent meetings and to spread the Gospel to these people who were to become Christians. 
We can see a pattern in the Bible where God uses people who are willing and does not convert those who are not willing to receive the Gospel. Those unwilling then attack the Christians, such as the Pharisees and the Sadducees, temporarily decreasing the number of Christians due to their deaths or apostasy, but eventually always increasing the number of Christians elsewhere.

In a sense the spread of the Gospel is much like cancer. I have often seen that when cutting or radiation is applied on cancer, metastasizing happens due to pieces of the cancer flowing to other parts of the body. This is like the persecution of Stephen and other Christians which caused them to scatter and multiply elsewhere. 
Then there is also chemotherapy which kills not only carcinogens but also healthy cells. That is like the devil killing both believers and unbelievers. Evolution is one such thing. Without the theory of (natural) evolution there would not have communism #tags/ideology/communism and National Socialism (Nazism) #tags/apologetics/evolution #tags/historic events# that caused 6 million Jews to be killed by Germans, 12 million Christians by the Russians (USSR) and many Christians and non-Christians by Chinese communists. See http://knowledgeglue.com/hidden-holocaust-remembering-12-7-million-christians-murdered-atheist-ussr/ for more information. This is aside from the unbelievers who were killed alongside. #church/material/sermon

Pop culture is also one of these examples. Most deaths within this culture due to abortion (both the mother and child), drug overdose, AIDS and other STDs, sexualization of the society which causes more people to watch porn, more people to visit prostitutes and more women to solicit, eventually causing deaths or destruction of their lives in another way, occur on the non-Christian side. Why would the devil do that? The number of deaths is relatively small when see for example how many drug users there are who do not die. These deaths are a small price to pay for the impact it has under Christians, for Christians as well are influenced by all of the above. 
Christian parents who want to raise their children for God lose their children to the pop culture, who follow their music or movie idols rather than God, and break the holy laws of matrimony and have adulterated and immoral forms of sex. The Christians themselves cannot be influenced, but the devil can still take away their influence on other. 
Christians who watch movies all the time, who might not be influenced by the violence and sex in those movies, will spend their time watching movies instead of studying the Bible and spreading the Gospel. Those who are *lightly* influenced by them, might not perform violence or sex, but they will condone it or be less sensitive to it. They will not be very sensitive to the problem of conversations with people of the opposite sex, driving in the same car with them or of guys touching girls, no matter which part of their body, or their children going on holidays with other non-Christian children. And all of this is when these Christians have been *lightly* influenced. Imagine what would happen if they had been *severely* influenced!

*36 And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “See, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?” 38 And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. 39 And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing. 40 But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.* 

Once again he preached the Gospel to all the towns, just like in verse 25 where he preaches it to many of the cities in Samaria. Whether this is literally *all* or not, it still is a lot and we can see why he is also called Philip the Evangelist. 
It is an honorable name to be called, for few are like that and few have the gift of being able to fearlessly and passionately spread the Gospel to strangers.
Is this really a gift, just like there are different personality traits where some people like to be on stage, such as certain types such as the 7s #todo/opzoeken in the enneagram and the *I*s in DISC? I can say that the answer is no. I know of four persons who Evangelize on streets every week and two of them are mature Christians but *C-S*-types. Two other Christians have recently renewed their faith and are still immature but they have a passion of spreading the Gospel as well. 
It is all about passion. Courage is an important factor indeed, but courage is that which drives one *despite* his lack of talent or the presence of fear. One with a lot of talent and implicitly little fear is by definition not courageous. But passion can give one courage. 
We do not know about Philip's DISC profile nor his courage or his personality. All we know is that he is obedient and sensitive to God's voice. He not only listens to God's voice, he can also hear it, in such a specific way that he knows where to go, when to run and what to say. He trusts in the Lord that He will provide. 
The Lord indeed has provided everything Philip needed. Even the water for the eunuch to be baptized in and the "transportation" to the next city in a miraculous way. 
::God provided in his logistic needs, his spiritual needs and whatever is needed to finish the work.:: The latter was not even done by Philip. He told the story of Jesus indeed, but it was the Spirit that converted the eunuch; He baptized the eunuch indeed, but as soon as the eunuch had risen, Philip was gone. Philip could not grant himself the glory of discipling or instructing him. God would use his own ways to guide the eunuch. 
Why do we still serve God then? The answer is: it is not because He needs us. The reason we serve Him is because we love Him. 
This is something I need to learn as well. 

I have had situations both in this and in other ministries where I took on a task but did not allow others to help me with anything significant. When I did, others would slow me down or break things I needed. An example of this was my former congregation, the mother church of our current church, named LEEF! (Zuid). I was in charge of the technical part of the music, which involved the organisation of a lot cables. When people helped me they rolled the cables in such a way that these were tangled. When I needed these cables afterwards, it would cost me twice as much time to untangle everything. As for other materials, I have experienced more than once that expensive stuff was broken. People who dropped my stage piano, the charger thereof and microphones, broken music and microphone stands and expensive XLR cables. 
But whenever I deny them from helping me, I am denying their need to love me and show me their love. 

I only started realizing this when I was in position like this myself when I was on the other side, wanting to show my love for another person. A friend of mine was single and had to take care of her mother by herself, who was suffering from the last stages of (liver) cancer. She did not tell others how her mother was feeling, how she was feeling, she did not ask others for help nor did she accept any help. 
I was feeling that this is not healthy and thinking of why this is wrong. It was not my opinion that it was wrong, I felt that was *objectively* wrong, but I could not put my finger on it. 
Coincidentally, around that time, my coach, Jan Baan, told me a story of a church in need for funds. An elderly widow wanted to contribute to the cause and offered about 15 guilders (about 6 euros). The pastor empathized with her and said she could keep her money and that God would find a way to finance the project, knowing that these 15 guilders were like drops in the ocean, but would be worth a lot more to her, given her personal situation. The woman, however, responded as follows: 
> *You are denying me my gift of giving to the Lord.*   
This made me realize that I should not deny one's help, no matter how little it is. 
I am still learning how to balance the sake of efficiency, not bothering others and truly accepting and utilizing my fellow Christians' love.
